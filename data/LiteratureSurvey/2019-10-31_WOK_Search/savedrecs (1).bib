Abstract = {{Livestock-caused rangeland degradation remains a major policy concern
   globally and the subject of widespread scientific study. This concern
   persists in part because it is difficult to isolate the effects of
   livestock from climate and other factors that influence ecosystem
   conditions. Further, degradation studies seldom use multiple plant and
   soil indicators linked to a clear definition of and ecologically
   grounded framework for degradation assessment that distinguishes
   different levels of degradation. Here, we integrate two globally
   applicable rangeland degradation frameworks and apply them to a
   broad-scale empirical data set for the country of Mongolia. We compare
   our assessment results with two other recent national rangeland
   degradation assessments in Mongolia to gauge consistency of findings
   across assessments and evaluate the utility of our framework. We
   measured livestock-use impacts across Mongolia's major ecological zones:
   mountain and forest steppe, eastern steppe, steppe, and desert steppe.
   At 143 sites in 36 counties, we measured livestock-use and degradation
   indicators at increasing distances from livestock corrals in
   winter-grazed pastures. At each site, we measured multiple indicators
   linked to our degradation framework, including plant cover, standing
   biomass, palatability, species richness, forage quality, vegetation
   gaps, and soil surface characteristics. Livestock use had no effect on
   soils, plant species richness, or standing crop biomass in any
   ecological zone, but subtly affected plant cover and palatable plant
   abundance. Livestock effects were strongest in the steppe zone, moderate
   in the desert steppe, and limited in the mountain/forest and eastern
   steppes. Our results aligned closely with those of two other recent
   country-wide assessments, suggesting that our framework may have
   widespread application. All three assessments found that very severe and
   irreversible degradation is rare in Mongolia (1-18\% of land area), with
   most rangelands slightly (33-53\%) or moderately (25-40\%) degraded. We
   conclude that very severe livestock-induced rangeland degradation is
   overstated in Mongolia. However, targeted rangeland restoration coupled
   with monitoring, adaptive management and stronger rangeland governance
   are needed to prevent further degradation where heavy grazing could
   cause irreversible change. Given the broad applicability of our
   degradation framework for Mongolia, we suggest it be tested for
   application in other temperate grasslands throughout Central Asia and
   North America.}},

Abstract = {{The predicted long lag time between a decrease in atmospheric deposition
   and a measured response in vegetation has generally excluded the
   investigation of vegetation recovery from the impacts of atmospheric
   deposition. However, policy-makers require such evidence to assess
   whether policy decisions to reduce emissions will have a positive impact
   on habitats. Here we have shown that 40 years after the peak of SOx
   emissions, decreases in SOx are related to significant changes in
   species richness and cover in Scottish Calcareous, Mestrophic, Nardus
   and Wet grasslands. Using a survey of vegetation plots across Scotland,
   first carried out between 1958 and 1987 and resurveyed between 2012 and
   2014, we test whether temporal changes in species richness and cover of
   bryophytes, Cyperaceae, forbs, Poaceae, and Juncaceae can be explained
   by changes in sulphur and nitrogen deposition, climate and/or grazing
   intensity, and whether these patterns differ between six grassland
   habitats: Acid, Calcareous, Lolium, Nardus, Mesotrophic and Wet
   grasslands. The results indicate that Calcareous, Mesotrophic, Nardus
   and Wet grasslands in Scotland are starting to recover from the UK peak
   of SOx deposition in the 1970's. A decline in the cover of grasses, an
   increase in cover of bryophytes and forbs and the development of a more
   diverse sward (a reversal of the impacts of increased SOx)was related to
   decreased SOx deposition. However there was no evidence of a recovery
   from SOx deposition in the Acid or Lolium grasslands. Despite a decline
   in NOx deposition between the two surveys we found no evidence of a
   reversal of the impacts of increased N deposition. The climate also
   changed significantly between the two surveys, becoming warmer and
   wetter. This change in climate was related to significant changes in
   both the cover and species richness of bryophytes, Cyperaceae, forbs,
   Poaceae and Juncaceae but the changes differed between habitats. (C)

Abstract = {{The Corncrake Crex crex breeds mainly in managed grasslands in Europe.
   Agri-environment schemes (AES) were introduced in many European
   countries to protect broods from earlier and more frequent mowing. In
   order to assess the efficacy of these AES on the scale of regional
   populations, we obtained information on current AES options for
   Corncrakes in 33 countries and administrative regions within the
   European Union (EU) and European free Trade Association (EFTA) using a
   questionnaire. Options suitable for Comcrake conservation were available
   in 18 regions, but coverage of the regional Comcrake populations was
   highly variable. Coverage with AES was high in selected western regions,
   but low throughout eastern Europe where most Corncrakes breed. The
   various suitable options together covered only 6.2\% of the total
   Comcrake population inside the EU and EFTA. While AES were effective at
   restoring Comcrake populations in Scotland, no evidence was found for
   effects on populations in other EU regions.Limited coverage of Comcrake
   populations in countries holding the largest populations, as well as its
   low breeding-site fidelity suggest that the Corncrake's future is not
   secured by the current extent of AES. If current farming practices in
   eastern European countries become more intensive as expected, the
   species' future may be at risk. Besides developing AES which are more
   attractive to farmers and better targeting the requirement of
   Corncrakes, conservation of farmland birds in Europe should pay more
   attention to continent wide changes of breeding conditions in order to
   be successful.}},

Pages = {{509-520}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The local- and regional-based forms of anthropogenic change
   reducing grassland diversity are generally identified, but these
   scale-dependent processes tend to co-occur with unclear interactive
   effects. Here, we explicitly test how common local and regional
   perturbations simultaneously affect plant alpha and beta diversity in a
   multiyear community assembly experiment using fragments of grassland
   habitat of various sizes. We hypothesized that local disturbances and
   decreasing patch size would interact, suppressing local diversity while
   homogenizing composition among patches.
   Location: North America.
   Methods: We conducted a three-year grassland assembly experiment,
   factorially manipulating local perturbation (nitrogen addition and
   mowing) and patch area for 36 patches over 13ha. We quantified the
   individual and interactive effects of these local and regional factors
   on plant alpha and beta diversity within (quadrat scale) and among
   patches (patch scale). We also used a null model approach to disentangle
   between stochastic- and niche-based assembly mechanisms.
   Results: We detected a gradient of assembly outcomes driven by two
   non-interacting factorsthe effects of N fertilization on alpha
   (negative) and beta (positive) diversity regardless of spatial scale and
   the scale-dependant effect of increasing patch size on alpha (positive)
   and beta (positive) diversity. These effects unfolded over time, with
   the constraints on richness and composition shifting from
   dispersal-based during the first sampling year to perturbation-and
   size-based factors at year two and three. Fertilization effects were
   driven by a mixture of deterministic (i.e., selection at the species
   level) and stochastic (i.e., random extinctions) processes resulting in
   a decline in local richness but an increase in spatial heterogeneity in
   species composition. Area appeared to influence alpha diversity mainly
   via stochastic ``sampling effect{''}-larger patches represented a larger
   sample of the regional pool. Niche-based processes, however, led to
   convergence in beta diversity among smaller patches driving a positive
   overall effect of area on beta diversity.
   Main conclusion: Our results illustrate how diversity regulation in
   contemporary grasslands can be simultaneously shaped by local and
   regional factors acting additively but via contrasting assembly
   mechanisms that operate at different spatial and temporal scales.}},

Abstract = {{Upland calcareous grassland landscapes are typically comprised of a
   matrix of calcareous grassland, acid grassland and limestone heath plant
   communities. This matrix of habitats is produced by a combination of
   underlying geology, climate and management. These landscapes are
   typically managed through grazing, with management targeted to maintain
   particular plant communities in the calcareous grassland habitat, whilst
   patches of acid grassland and limestone heath are not targeted by
   conservation management. The biodiversity value of acid grassland and
   limestone heath patches within the calcareous grassland matrix are
   unknown. This study provides the first assessment of their biodiversity
   value by examining aspects of epigeal spider diversity supported by
   these non-target habitat patches in comparison to calcareous grassland.
   Spiders were sampled in each habitat from April to August 2014 using
   pitfall traps across three upland regions in Great Britain. Spider
   species assemblages were distinct between limestone heath and both
   grassland types. Distinction in species assemblages are likely due to
   differences in vegetation structure and microclimate, e.g., humidity,
   degree of shade. Each habitat type supported several rare species (e.g.,
   Jacksonella falconeri, Agyneta subtilis) revealing the contribution to
   spider fauna. The distinct spider species assemblage and presence of
   rare species in limestone heath patches demonstrate their importance in
   the upland calcareous grassland matrix. This study highlights the value
   of monitoring biodiversity in non-target habitats within a habitat
   matrix alongside those that are actively targeted by management.}},

Abstract = {{Do semi-fossorial herbivores influence the trajectory of plant community
   succession by altering belowground bud density in alpine meadows? Field
   surveys were carried out to investigate the effect of disturbance and
   disturbance intensity of the plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) on the
   belowground bud density in alpine meadows at two sites. The Linear Mixed
   Model (LMM) test and Linear Model (LM) test were used to analyze the
   relative effect of plateau pika disturbance on bud density and to
   clarify the response of belowground bud density to disturbance
   intensity. Our results showed that disturbance by the plateau pika
   increased belowground bud density of graminoids and plants from the
   grass and sedge families, including Kobresia pygmaea and Elymus nutans,
   but had no effect on forbs bud density. The bud density of graminoids,
   grass and sedge plants, and K. pygmaea and E. nutans showed a downward
   parabolic trend in response to increased disturbance intensity of the
   plateau pika, implying that there was an optimal level of disturbance
   intensity that maximized belowground bud density of graminoids. These
   results suggest that disturbance by the plateau pika has different
   effects on belowground bud densities of graminoids versus forbs.
   Additionally, disturbance by plateau pika up to the optimal intensity
   may improve grazing quality of alpine meadow in the long term through
   increasing graminoid bud density, resulting in a higher proportion of
   graminoids in pasture, while higher levels of disturbance by plateau
   pika may deteriorate alpine meadows through a reduction in graminoid bud
   density.}},

Title = {{The importance of sponges and mangroves in supporting fish communities

Abstract = {{Fish communities associated with coral reefs worldwide are threatened by
   habitat degradation and overexploitation. We assessed coral reefs,
   mangrove fringes, and seagrass meadows on the Caribbean coast of Panama
   to explore the influences of their proximity to one another, habitat
   cover, and environmental characteristics in sustaining biomass, species
   richness and trophic structure of fish communities in a degraded
   tropical ecosystem. We found 94\% of all fish across all habitat types
   were of small body size (<= 10 cm), with communities dominated by fishes
   that usually live in habitats of low complexity, such as Pomacentridae
   (damselfishes) and Gobiidae (gobies). Total fish biomass was very low,
   with the trend of small fishes from low trophic levels over-represented,
   and top predators under-represented, relative to coral reefs elsewhere
   in the Caribbean. For example, herbivorous fishes comprised 27\% of
   total fish biomass in Panama relative to 10\% in the wider Caribbean,
   and the small parrotfish Scarus iseri comprised 72\% of the parrotfish
   biomass. Wefound evidence that non-coral biogenic habitats support
   reef-associated fish communities. In particular, the abundance of
   sponges on a given reef and proximity of mangroves were found to be
   important positive correlates of reef fish species richness, biomass,
   abundance and trophic structure. Our study indicates that a diverse fish
   community can persist on degraded coral reefs, and that the availability
   and arrangement within the seascape of other habitat-forming organisms,
   including sponges and mangroves, is critical to the maintenance of
   functional processes in such ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Soil seed banks support the recovery of plant species and communities
   after disturbances. Against the background of increasing disturbance
   frequencies due to current changes in climate and land use, the
   importance of seed banks to maintain ecosystem functioning of grasslands
   is likely to increase. This makes seed bank ecology a highly relevant
   topic of studies on ecosystem functioning. One of the main drivers of
   seed bank composition and density in grasslands is the current
   management. Although highly intensive grassland management can affect
   soil seed banks negatively, it is still unclear which component of
   management - fertilization, mowing or grazing - is the most influential.
   We studied soil seed banks of 73 mesic grasslands, which were arranged
   along a gradient of land-use intensity, by two seasonally differing
   surveys. Grasslands generally exhibited rather poor seed banks with low
   numbers of species and seedlings. Both were even lower in spring
   compared to autumn sampling. Grassland management turned out to affect
   soil seed banks in a complex way, via direct and indirect paths. While
   intensive mowing and fertilization decreased species richness and
   seedling density, grazing intensity increased species richness in the
   seed bank. Thus, land-use intensity, an index calculated as a sum of all
   three components, had highly ambivalent effects on seed banks. We
   conclude that the positive effect of grazing on soil seed banks makes
   pastures more resilient towards mechanic disturbances as compared to
   meadows.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing climatic and anthropogenic pressures on soil ecosystems are
   expected to create a global patchwork of disturbance scenarios. Some
   regions will be strongly impacted by climate change, others by
   agricultural intensification, and others by both. Soil microbial
   communities are integral components of terrestrial ecosystems, but their
   responses to multiple perturbations are poorly understood. Here, we
   exposed soils from sustainably- or intensively-managed grasslands in an
   agro-silvo-pastoral oak woodland to month-long intensified drought and
   flood simulation treatments in a controlled mesocosm setting. We
   monitored the response of the bacterial communities at the end of one
   month as well as during the following month of recovery. The communities
   in sustainably-managed plots under all precipitation regimes were richer
   and more diverse than those in intensively-managed plots, and contained
   a lower proportion of rapidly-growing taxa. Soils from both land
   managements exhibited changes in bacterial community composition in
   response to flooding, but only intensively-managed soils were affected
   by drought. The ecologies of bacteria favored by both drought and flood
   point to both opportunism and stress tolerance as key traits shaping the
   community following disturbance. Finally, the response of several taxa
   (i.e. Chloracidobacteria RB41, Janthinobacterium sp.) to precipitation
   depended on land management, suggesting that the community itself
   affected individual disturbance responses. Our findings provide an
   in-depth view of the complexity of soil bacterial community responses to
   climatic and anthropogenic pressures in time, and highlight the
   potential of these stressors to have multiplicative effects on the soil
   biota. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Transmission of helminths between species of ruminants in austria
   appears More likely to Occur than generally assumed}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 8}},
Abstract = {{Helminth infections of the gastrointestinal tract and lungs can lead to
   devastating economical losses to the pastoral based animal production.
   Farm animals can suffer from malnutrition, tissue damage, and blood loss
   resulting in impaired production traits and reproduction parameters. In
   Austria, pastures grazed by sheep, goats, and cattle overlap with the
   habitats of several species of wild cervids (roe deer, red deer, sika
   deer, and fallow deer) and bovids (mouflon, chamois, and ibex), and
   transmission of parasites between different ruminant species seems
   likely. A complete and updated overview on the occurrence of helminths
   of domestic and wild ruminants in Austria is presented. Based on these
   data, intersections of the host spectrum of the determined parasites
   were depicted. The ``liability index{''} was applied to identify the
   ruminant species, which most likely transmit parasites between each
   other. A degree for host specificity was calculated for each parasite
   species based on the average taxonomic distance of their host species.
   Of the 73 identified helminth species 42 were identified as generalists,
   and 14 transmission experiments supported the assumed broad host
   specificity for 14 generalists and 1 specialist helminth species.
   Overall, 61 helminths were found to infect more than one host species,
   and 4 were found in all 10 ruminant species investigated. From these
   analyses, it can be concluded that a number of helminth parasites of the
   gastrointestinal tract and the lungs are potentially transmitted between
   domestic and wild ruminants in Austria. For some parasites and host
   species, experimental evidence is in support for possible transmission,
   while for other such studies are lacking. Host preference of different
   genotypes of the same parasite species may have a confounding effect on
   the evaluation of cross-transmission, but so far this has not been
   evaluated systematically in helminths in Austria. Further studies
   focusing on experimental cross-transmission and genetic characterization
   are needed to define the potential consequences for the epidemiology of
   those parasites, animal welfare, and economic impact.}},

Pages = {{19-27}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Disturbed areas within national parks, resulting from historic and
   current land use activities, can harbor large and diverse populations of
   non-native plant species. These species must be controlled to prevent
   their spread and to restore native grassland. Research on alternative
   revegetation methods is urgently needed since seed based grassland
   restoration is often unsuccessful. The effectiveness of transplanting to
   restore foothills fescue grassland following implementation of
   non-native plant management was investigated at three disturbed sites in
   Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada. Non-native plant
   abundance was reduced by cutting, glyphosate application, and steaming.
   Greenhouse grown seedlings of native fescue grassland species (13 forbs,
   five grasses, two shrubs) were outplanted into plots following
   management treatments, as three different sizes of container stock. The
   effects of prior non-native plant management and container size on
   transplant survival and growth were assessed over two growing seasons.
   Rhizomatous forbs and bunchgrasses with well-developed root systems had
   highest survival (> 50\% over 14 months). Transplants with 10- to 15-cm
   rooting depth in cones and root trainers had significantly higher
   within-year survival than tray transplants with a shallow rooting depth.
   Transplant survival was improved by glyphosate application to control
   non-native plants prior to planting. Transplanting was effective for
   increasing native cover and species richness although high winter
   mortality reduced this effect. Key species for fescue grassland function
   were introduced at all sites and persisted for two growing seasons.}},

Abstract = {{Spillover between agricultural land and natural habitats is recognised
   as an important mechanism shaping biodiversity and ecosystem functions.
   Its spatio-temporal patterns and magnitude are thoroughly described in
   the literature and it is often stated that spillover should be
   considered in conservation planning. In fact studies that implement and
   test active interventions to modulate spillover are scarce. Therefore,
   we studied the spillover of spiders and carabids between hay meadows and
   natural forests after mowing and tested whether leaving unmown buffer
   strips in the edges can mitigate undesirable aspects of mowing-induced
   spillover. We found that mowing affected the assemblages both in the
   meadows and forests and, interestingly, changes were more profound in
   the forests. Mowing reduced the spillover of forest assemblages into
   meadows. Mowing also led to the retraction of forest assemblages from
   the peripheral zones of forests but did not trigger an influx of meadow
   assemblages into the forests. Wide (10 m) unmown buffers attenuated or
   completely offset most of these effects. Leaving narrow (5 m) buffers
   had unexpected consequences, as they did not function only as buffers
   but as facilitators of forest-ward spillover from meadows, potentially
   compromising ecological interactions such as predation or competition in
   forests. We conclude that using wide buffers can be recommended as a
   refinement of standard management practices in hay meadow-forest
   mosaics. Narrow buffers should be applied with great caution and should
   generally be avoided if the forest-specific assemblages are of
   conservation interest.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances can affect the biotic resistance of plant communities and
   alterations could take place in the system, such as the appearance or
   increase in abundance of new components. To characterize the resistance
   to disturbance and the aptitude to limit the establishment of alien
   plants, it is necessary to know the functional and specific diversity of
   plant communities. The objective was to evaluate the effects of grazing
   by feral horses on the resistance of natural grasslands of Argentina to
   alien plant invasion by means of specific composition and functional
   structure. Two grasslands under continuous grazing by feral horses and
   two exclosures were studied. Species composition and functional
   structure were characterized using species richness, Shannon's diversity
   index, functional richness, functional evenness and functional
   divergence. Alien plant richness and abundance, as well as alien:native
   plants ratio were determined. Specific composition and functional
   structure were negatively affected by feral horse grazing and the
   distribution of alien species in the different functional groups
   differed in areas with contrasting grazing histories. The activity of
   feral horses can modify the abundance of dominant plants and functional
   diversity, thus providing niche opportunities for the establishment of
   alien plants, in turn affecting the function and structure of the
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands are vital for maintaining grassland butterflies
   in Japan, as well as in Europe. However, severe decline in these
   grassland environments has recently attracted attention to linear
   grasslands, such as firebreaks and power-line corridors, as alternative
   habitats for grassland insects. We surveyed butterflies in an abandoned
   grassland and nearby linear mown firebreaks adjacent to different
   vegetation at the northern foot of Mt. Fuji, central Japan, over 5
   successive years, particularly focusing on species on the 2012 Japanese
   Red List of Threatened Species ({''}red-list{''} species). We found that
   the firebreaks were consistently higher in species richness and
   abundance of butterflies than the long-term abandoned grassland, and
   that species composition differed among the firebreaks depending on
   conditions of the adjacent vegetation. The firebreaks surrounded by
   forests were mainly utilized by forest and edge species, whereas the
   firebreaks adjacent to the grassland were essential for conserving
   red-list grassland species. Thus, only the mown firebreaks adjacent to
   the grassland were regarded as a high-quality alternative habitat for
   many grassland butterflies, but the area was limited. Therefore,
   creating heterogeneity in the abandoned grassland by infrequent mowing
   could help conserve grassland butterflies, including red-list species.}},

Abstract = {{The ecosystem services (ES) approach is a framework for describing the
   benefits of nature to human well-being, and this has become a popular
   instrument for assessment and evaluation of ecosystems and their
   functions. Grazing lands can provide a wide array of ES that depend on
   their management practices and intensity. This article reviews the
   trends and approaches used in the analysis of some relevant ES provided
   by grazing systems, in line with the framework principles of the
   Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA). The scientific literature provides
   reports of many studies on ES in general, but the search here focused on
   grazing systems, which returned only sixty-two papers. This review of
   published papers highlights that: (i) in some papers, the concept of ES
   as defined by the MA is misunderstood (e.g., lack of anthropocentric
   vision); (ii) 34\% of the papers dealt only with one ES, which neglects
   the need for the multisectoral approach suggested by the MA; (iii) few
   papers included stakeholder involvement to improve local decision-making
   processes; (iv) cultural ES have been poorly studied despite being
   considered the most relevant for local and general stakeholders; and (v)
   stakeholder awareness of well-being as provided by ES in grazing systems
   can foster both agri-environmental schemes and the willingness to pay
   for these services.}},

   semi-natural dry grassland habitat}},
Journal = {{HELIYON}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Semi-natural dry grassland sites are of great importance for nature
   conservation because they support high species diversity and the
   abundance of ``Red-List{''} species. Grazing has proved to be a
   successful management tool in terms of maintenance and restoration of
   biodiversity. For a deeper understanding of the effects of different
   grazers on species biodiversity in dry grasslands, it is necessary to
   study the long-term effects of major changes in grazing management. In a
   semi-natural dry grassland habitat, which was formerly grazed by cattle,
   we investigated the changes in plant species composition due to long
   term grazing by sheep and goats. Specifically we asked: a) How does
   long-term grazing by sheep and goats change the composition of all plant
   species and particularly those that are on the Red-List? Are changes
   caused mainly by species turnover? b) How does long-term grazing by
   sheep and goats influence the fertility and acidity of the soil? To
   address these questions, we compared the composition and diversity of
   plants as well deriving Ellenberg indicator values of the species.
   Long-term grazing by sheep and goats subsequent to a year-round cattle
   grazing changed the plant species composition of the dry grasslands
   resulting in a high species turnover rate. It did not, however, lead to
   an increase in plant species diversity even though Red-List species were
   considerably more abundant in 2013. Overall, the grazing regime studied
   positively influenced vegetation composition. The effects on local
   species composition due to species turnover might further be influenced
   by local factors like soil nitrogen availability.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing plays a key role in many ecosystems worldwide and can affect the
   structure and composition of terrestrial plant communities. Nonetheless,
   how grazing management, especially grazing regime (yearlong continuous
   and seasonal grazing), affects the relationship between grazing and
   vegetation on alpine grasslands has not been extensively studied. Here,
   we performed a grazing experiment in Gangcha county of Qinghai province
   of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to test the effects of different stocking
   rates and grazing regimes on grassland biomass and plant structure and
   composition. Six stocking rates (ranging from 0 to 5.62 sheep ha(-1))
   were used for continuous grazing, and three grazing intensities (1.72,
   2.87, and 5.62 sheep ha(-1)) were used for seasonal grazing (grazed only
   in the growing season, from June to October) at the study sites. Plant
   biomass and grass functional community composition were characterized in
   two different yr (2011 and 2012). Additionally, species richness and
   plant diversity indexes were estimated to quantify the impacts of
   grazing on plant community composition. Our results indicated that
   grazing intensity best explained the plant biomass decrease in
   low-productivity environments, and different grazing regimes also
   influenced these results. The shifts in plant community structure and
   composition in response to increased grazing intensity differed
   considerably between continuous grazing and seasonal grazing. Seasonal
   grazing maintained greater amounts of palatable plant species, and fewer
   undesirable species in plant communities when compared with the
   composition after continuous grazing. Our results emphasize the
   importance of grazing regime in regulating the effects of grazing on
   plant communities and the importance of seasonal grazing for ecosystem
   maintenance, especially in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. This suggests
   that periodic resting of grasslands could be a good management strategy
   to keep palatable species, thereby minimizing undesirable species in the
   overall species composition. (C) 2017 The Society for Range Management.

Abstract = {{During the last few decades, there have been an increasing number of
   studies on grassland ecology in China, involving the classic ecology
   concepts or theories and the applicable ecological principles of
   grassland conservation or management. This paper reviews the main
   progress in the following aspects. (1) Research on grassland species
   adaptation and resistance, population dynamics and foraging behavior,
   and biodiversity and community stability. (2) Research on managed
   grassland ecosystems (grassland grazing ecology) including grazing
   effects on grassland ecosystem function and foraging behavior by large
   herbivores. (3) Global climate change and grassland processes and
   functioning. (4) Applied research on grassland restoration and ecosystem
   health assessments such as vegetation restoration, restoration of
   ecosystem functioning, and assessment methods. There have been
   significant advances in grassland ecology, including the functions of
   ecosystem biodiversity, the ecological stoichiometry mechanisms
   affecting grassland community stability, grazing regulation of plant
   diversity and nutrient cycling. Grassland ecologists have succeeded in
   making these advances through observational, experimental and
   theoretical studies. Nevertheless, there are still significant
   challenges for the grassland ecology research, including understanding
   of grassland spatial processes, grassland grazing and
   multi-functionality, integrated effects of global climate change across
   grassland areas, as well as the ecological methodology and experimental
   techniques in grassland ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are crucial parts of the terrestrial ecosystem, with an
   extremely high differentiation of productivity and diversity across
   spatial scales and land use patterns. The practices employed to manage
   grassland, such as grazing, haymaking, fertilization or reseeding, can
   improve the grassland condition. This study focuses on the changes in
   productivity and diversity and the relationship between them as affected
   by management practices. Productivity and diversity have unequivocally
   been altered in response to different management practices. When grazing
   intensity of a typical steppe increased from 1.5 to 9 sheep per hectare,
   both productivity and diversity declined. Higher grazing intensity (6 to
   9 sheep per hectare) accelerated loss of diversity because of lower
   productivity. Productivity was significantly improved but diversity was
   lost by fertilizing. N fertilization also reduced the sensitivity of
   diversity to productivity. A similar response was found in mown
   grassland with increased productivity and diversity but their
   relationship was negatively affected. Mowing also slowed down the
   decline in diversity as productivity increased. Reseeding
   purple-flowered alfalfa led to an increased diversity, while
   yellow-flowered alfalfa increased productivity significantly. The
   negative productivity-diversity relationship was transformed to a
   positive one by reseeding alfalfa. These results enhance understanding
   of how productivity, diversity and their relationships change in
   response to altered grassland management practices, and support an
   integrated approach for improving both productivity and diversity.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the effects of different grazing systems in two
   neighboring regions with similar biotic and abiotic factors, Nalan Soum
   in Mongolia and Naren Soum in Inner Mongolia, China. We employed the
   quadrat sampling method and remote sensing to set three perpendicular
   lines that dissect the boundary between the two countries, and seven
   lines parallel to the boundary to form a rectangular shape as a means to
   compare plant community response to different grazing systems under
   natural conditions. NDVI data is included in discussing the causes of
   Mongolian grassland degradation. The results of quadrat sampling and
   NDVI analysis show that rotational grazing has greater values for the
   quadrat's average height, total coverage, total individual density, and
   total aboveground biomass (p < 0.05), but has lower species richness
   than continuous grazing (p > 0.05). The NVDI values of rotational
   grazing in 1989, 2005, 2011, and 2016 were higher those of continuous
   grazing, and significant difference was shown in 2011 and 2016; the NDVI
   value of continuous grazing in 1993 was higher than that of rotational
   grazing, but did not show a significant difference. This indicates that
   different grazing approaches affect steppe ecological systems in
   different ways, despite their similar biotic and abiotic factors, as
   well as grazing intensity. Nonetheless, we find rotational grazing to be
   better for ecosystem vitality than continuous grazing, to some degree.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Studies of grassland communities have demonstrated that increasing
   vertebrate grazing decreases the diversity of specialised herbivorous
   insects, while plant diversity is maintained or increased. However, we
   still have a limited understanding of the causal mechanisms underlying
   these contrasting observations of two tightly linked groups of
   organisms.
   We used spatially linked plant and moth observations from salt marshes,
   sampled for 3years along an experimental sheep-grazing gradient (0, 1-2,
   3-4 and 10 sheep ha(-1)), to test whether the disruption of plant-insect
   interactions by large herbivores accounts for these contrasting grazing
   effects. Moths were caught using emergence traps, which were moved and
   repositioned every 3weeks.
   Firstly, we quantified species turnover between the grazing regimes for
   both taxa (measured as SOrensen dissimilarity) using a null-model
   approach. Secondly, we analysed the number of observed insect - host
   associations under the different regimes.
   Species turnover between grazing regimes was significant (after
   correcting for rarefaction effects) for moth species, but not for
   plants, indicating very few and random effects of grazing on plant
   species composition. The percentage of realised plant-moth associations
   decreased from 37\% in the absence of grazing to 6.5\% under high
   stocking densities.
   We thus conclude that vertebrate grazing caused a disruption of
   plant-moth associations, probably by rendering the host-plants
   unsuitable for most of the moth species. Our findings provide further
   mechanistic understanding on how large herbivores shape arthropod
   communities and illustrate the importance of host-plant associations in
   explaining effects of natural or anthropogenic habitat modification.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed patch burning is a well-known tool for grassland and savanna
   management that has been recognised as a suitable strategy to enhance
   biodiversity at landscape-level scales. Nevertheless, effective
   monitoring of the biota responses to fire is an essential step towards
   biodiversity conservation. We investigated fire effects on thrips
   communities (Thysanoptera) - a group of minute and diverse insect in
   grasslands. We performed a replicated small-scale fire experiment in
   South Brazilian Campos, and tested for fire effects on total abundance,
   species richness of different feeding guilds (e.g. leaf, flower and
   fungal feeders) and thrips species body size in the short (1month) and
   long-term (1year). We found positive fire effects on leaf herbivore
   richness in recently burned patches where the resprouted vegetation had
   enhanced nutritional quality, and also later on following the
   diversification of plant communities. The richness of fungivorous thrips
   was also benefited by resource heterogeneity in burned patches 1year
   after fire. A positive fire effect on thrips community body size was
   also found at this time, possibly indicating that larger species had an
   advantage in dispersal to the spatially distributed burned patches
   across the unburned grassland matrix. Effects on total abundances were
   not detected. Our study emphasises the role of prescribed patch burnings
   in producing high quality resource-rich habitat spots for Thysanoptera
   communities at local scales.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-year temporal studies are invaluable tools for monitoring changes
   in biodiversity through time. However, their applications in coastal
   ecosystems are still scarce. We investigated temporal trends in coastal
   dunes analyzing a set of 858 randomly-sampled georeferenced relev,s
   performed between 2002 and 2015 along Central Italy's sandy coastlines.
   Specifically, we explored changes in species richness and cover of
   targeted sandy habitats, we investigated trends in the cover of selected
   psammophilous native species and we assessed patterns of invasion by
   means of regression techniques. We observed a significant decrease in
   species richness and cover of the dune grasslands habitat. The
   species-level analysis confirmed a negative trend for two characteristic
   species of dune grasslands, Cutandia maritima and Medicago littoralis,
   while revealing a similar decline for Crucianella maritima and for
   Ammophila arenaria subsp. australis, key species of mobile dunes. The
   most striking trends emerged analyzing patterns in the cover of an
   invasive alien species, Carpobrotus sp., which showed a concerning
   increase in shifting dunes. In conclusion, our analyses reveal
   concerning changes involving dune grasslands, and at the same time hint
   at ``early warnings{''} of degradation processes traceable in shifting

Abstract = {{Wetlands are amongst the richest, yet most threatened types of habitats
   on Earth. One major threat is the modification of water regime for human
   activities, which disrupts normal ecosystem equilibrium. In lacustrine
   wetlands, reduced flooding allows shrubs to take over, ultimately
   leading to a shift towards woody communities. To counter this, wetland
   managers have initiated a variety of measures, including mowing,
   burning, and pasturing. Because of the short time frames of previous
   studies on the subject, little is known on their potential negative side
   effects on the ecosystem. Here, we evaluate the long-term effect of
   mowing on breeding populations of the five most abundant species in our
   central European study area (the reed warbler Acrocephalus scirpaceus,
   the common reed bunting Emberiza schoeniclus, Savi's warbler Locustella
   luscinioides, the water rail Rallus aquaticus, and the bearded reedling
   Panurus biarmicus). This study, of an unprecedented time scale (30
   years), shows that rotational mowing has no long-term detrimental
   effects on birds. However, optimal mowing regime for the birds might
   often be less frequent than what is usually applied. We recommend that
   mowing be spaced every 3 years at least, and ideally every 6 years or
   more. We discuss additional measures that could be implemented to
   complement mowing. Because of the widespread distribution of the target
   habitat and species, our study provides readily applicable information
   for wetland managers in Europe and worldwide.}},

Title = {{Covariation of soil nutrients drives occurrence of exotic and native
   plant species}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{777-785}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Nutrient enrichment with phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) threatens
   biodiversity globally, particularly because it drives invasion by exotic
   plant species. However, the effects of nutrients on plants can interact
   with other ecosystem processes such as competition and grazing, and
   these interactions can be scale-dependent. Furthermore, P and N are
   often correlated, making it difficult to separate the effects of each.
   2. After implementing a herbivore-exclusion experiment for 3years in
   grassy woodlands, SE Australia, we assessed the relationship of native
   and exotic plant species with soil nutrients, grazing and spatial scale.
   Nitrate (NO3), available P and organic carbon (C) were partitioned into
   two principle components and further divided into plot- and site-level
   variation.
   3. The correlated components of NO3, P and C (principle component 1)
   appeared to drive a dominant competitive relationship. Two exotic annual
   grasses likely out-competed native and exotic species in areas high in
   NO3, P and C. In contrast, responses to principle component 2 (gradient
   from high NO3 to high P) indicated that native and exotic species
   generally benefitted when NO3 was high relative to P.
   4. Plant-nutrient relationships were further modified by grazing and
   spatial scale. Native and exotic species benefitted from grazing but did
   so under specific nutrient regimes. Summed occurrence of exotic species
   and native richness was reduced in the absence of grazing and high
   values of NO3 relative to P at site scales, but not at plot scales,
   suggesting competition is more important at a scale of hundreds of
   square metres while soil properties are most important at the plot scale
   (25 m(2)).
   5. Synthesis and applications. Dividing soil nutrients into uncorrelated
   principal components showed that niche space for native and exotic plant
   species is partitioned by positive and negative covariation of nitrate
   (NO3), phosphorus (P) and carbon (C), and interactions of these soil
   properties with grazing and spatial scale. Increasing NO3 relative to P
   could increase species richness, but requires further experimentation to
   define beneficial concentrations. Native plant richness can be enhanced
   with adequate levels of grazing by native herbivores and, in the long
   term, by reducing P from areas enriched with NO3 and P. These actions
   will help prevent likely competitive dominance by annual exotic grasses.}},

Title = {{Mycorrhizal symbioses influence the trophic structure of the Serengeti}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{536-546}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. It is known that tropical grasslands such as Serengeti host large
   populations of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and that they respond
   to abiotic and biotic factors. It is also known that AM symbioses are
   important for the uptake of essential plant nutrients, which, in turn,
   influences the biomass and nutritional quality of herbivores and their
   predators. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of
   AM symbioses on the biomass of different trophic levels of an ecosystem.
   2. To do this, we first measured the neutral lipid fatty acid biomarker
   16: 1 omega 5 to estimate the biomass of AM fungi in a long-term grazing
   exclusion experiment. Then, we used model selection of Bayesian linear
   regressions to infer the primary factors that influence AM fungal
   biomass. Using model selection of different combinations of soil
   characteristics, we selected the best model using the leave-one-out
   cross-validation information criterion. Finally, we used the Madingley
   model to simulate the influence of AM fungi on higher trophic levels. We
   combined spatially explicit information about soil phosphorus and AM
   fungal biomass to explore the emergent patterns of the Serengeti
   resulting from AM symbioses.
   3. Our Bayesian analysis indicated that total soil phosphorus was the
   strongest predictor of AM fungal biomass, and there were significant
   interactions with grazing. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal biomass is
   lowest in soil where phosphorus is limited and increases with increasing
   phosphorus concentration. Biomass was also significantly higher in plots
   that were not grazed. The Madingley model indicated that nutritional
   benefits of AM symbioses maintain a substantial proportion of the
   biomass across all trophic levels.
   4. Synthesis. Our analysis shows that inputs of phosphorus through
   arbuscular mycorrhizal symbioses substantially increase the ability of
   plants to grow and maintain nutritional quality, cascading through the
   biomass of consumers and predators in the ecosystem. Although they
   account for less than 1\% of the total modelled biomass, the predicted
   nutritional benefit provided by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi increased
   the biomass of macro-organisms in the Serengeti by 48\%. When
   considering the management of biodiversity, future ecosystem models
   should account for the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi on all
   trophic levels.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Across the planet, grass-dominated biomes are experiencing shrub
   encroachment driven by atmospheric CO2 enrichment and land-use change.
   By altering resource structure and availability, shrub encroachment may
   have important impacts on vertebrate communities. We sought to determine
   the magnitude and variability of these effects across climatic
   gradients, continents, and taxa, and to learn whether shrub thinning
   restores the structure of vertebrate communities.
   Location: Worldwide.
   Time period: Contemporary.
   Major taxa studied: Terrestrial vertebrates.
   Methods: We estimated relationships between percentage shrub cover and
   the structure of terrestrial vertebrate communities (species richness,
   Shannon diversity and community abundance) in experimentally thinned and
   unmanipulated shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes using systematic
   review and meta-analyses of 43 studies published from 1978 to 2016. We
   modelled the effects of continent, biome, mean annual precipitation, net
   primary productivity and the normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) on the relationship between shrub cover and vertebrate community
   structure.
   Results: Species richness, Shannon diversity and total abundance had no
   consistent relationship with shrub encroachment and experimental
   thinning did not reverse encroachment effects on vertebrate communities.
   However, some effects of shrub encroachment on vertebrate communities
   differed with net primary productivity, amongst vertebrate groups, and
   across continents. Encroachment had negative effects on vertebrate
   diversity at low net primary productivity. Mammalian and herpetofaunal
   diversity decreased with shrub encroachment. Shrub encroachment also had
   negative effects on species richness and total abundance in Africa but
   positive effects in North America.
   Main conclusions: Biodiversity conservation and mitigation efforts
   responding to shrub encroachment should focus on low-productivity
   locations, on mammals and herpetofauna, and in Africa. However, targeted
   research in neglected regions such as central Asia and India will be
   needed to fill important gaps in our knowledge of shrub encroachment
   effects on vertebrates. Additionally, our findings provide an impetus
   for determining the mechanisms associated with changes in vertebrate
   diversity and abundance in shrub-encroached grass-dominated biomes.}},

Abstract = {{Wild edible fruits are a complement to the diet, generate income, and

   is threatened mainly by deforestation. The purpose of this work was to
   evaluate the distribution of 106 wild edible fruits from Veracruz state
   in several vegetation types and consider the effect of land-use changes
   on species distribution between 1993 and 2013. Seven species with the
   least number of herbarium specimens were chosen in order to estimate the
   current and potential distribution using Maxent models. The types of
   vegetation with the largest number of wild edible fruit species were the
   evergreen tropical rainforest with 64, deciduous tropical forest with
   51, and the mountain cloud forest with 33. The largest loss between 1993
   and 2013 was in secondary vegetation (0.19\%) and evergreen tropical
   rainforest (0.11\%). The main causes are the increment in human
   settlements and pasture, and grazing land (originally populated by
   tropical forests)-both factors that could put at risk, in the near
   future, most of the species studied. All of the species with restricted
   distribution in Veracruz showed a tendency to shrink in area,
   particularly the pinon (Pinus cembroides) and nuez de castilla (Juglans
   pynformis), both of economic importance In the face of land-use changes,
   conservation strategies must be designed in accordance with rational use
   and public policies that promote a sustainable management of wild edible
   fruits and the forests in which they grow.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe, butterflies have declined over the last decades mainly
   because of the increasing urbanization and the agricultural
   intensification occurred in lowlands areas. Drivers of butterfly decline
   were identified in changes of both local scale habitat characteristics
   and landscape-scale land-use coverage. Thus, to counteract the negative
   trend of butterfly populations, management actions that simultaneously
   have an effect on local and landscape scale environments are needed.
   The present research was performed in northern Italy, in a
   human-dominated area of about 170 km(2). From April to September 2014
   and 2015, we surveyed butterflies in 494 50-m sections, grouped into 44
   line transects. First, using a multi-scale GAMM, we analysed the
   simultaneous effect of local (nectar index, crop type, presence of
   woodlands and hedgerows and degree of shelter) and landscape (fractional
   cover in 500-m buffer of arable lands, meadows, woodlands and artificial
   surfaces) variables on butterfly richness and abundance. We evaluated
   the contribution of local and landscape variables by a variation
   partitioning approach. Second, we performed a GAMM to investigate the
   effect of specific management practices adopted in meadows, hedgerows
   and field margins on butterfly communities. Our results showed that the
   evaluation of the effect of local scale characteristics on butterfly
   communities definitely cannot disregard the landscape context. We thus
   suggest maintaining urban and agricultural areas alternated by a mosaic
   of nectar-rich land-covers, such as meadows and alfalfa, forest patches
   and hedgerows.
   Our study also allowed to formulate management guidelines of specific
   habitats. Accordingly, meadows should be managed by reducing the number
   of cuts, while wide herbaceous margins, characterised by a high grass
   layer rich in dicots, should be maintained in arable lands. To avoid a
   barrier effect and to guarantee the presence of a well-developed shrub
   layer, which provides high nectar resources, it is also necessary to
   avoid an excessive growth in hedgerows height. Results evidence that the
   adoption of these management guidelines and of a proper landscape
   planning strategy, can lead to play an important role in butterfly
   conservation even within human dominated areas.}},

Title = {{A six-year grazing exclusion changed plant species diversity of a Stipa
   breviflora desert steppe community, northern China}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Excluding grazers is one of most efficient ways to restore degraded
   grasslands in desert-steppe communities, but may negatively affect the
   recovery of plant species diversity. However, diversity differences
   between grazed and fenced grasslands in desert-steppe are poorly known.
   In a Stipa breviflora desert steppe community in Northern China, we
   established six plots to examine spatial patterns of plant species
   diversity under grazed and fenced conditions, respectively. We addressed
   three aspects of species diversity: (1) The logistic, exponential and
   power models were used to describe the species-area curve (SAR). Species
   richness, abundance and Shannon diversity values change differently with
   increasing sampling areas inside and outside of the fence. The best
   fitted model for SAR was the logistic model. Excluding grazers had a
   significant impact on the shape of SAR. (2) Variograms was applied to
   examine the spatial characteristics of plant species diversity. We found
   strong spatial autocorrelations in the diversity variables both inside
   and outside the fence. After grazing exclusion, the spatial
   heterogeneity decreased in species richness, increased in abundance and
   did not change in Shannon diversity. (3) We used variance partitioning
   to determine the relative contributions of spatial and environmental
   factors to plant species diversity patterns. Environmental factors
   explained the largest proportion of variation in species diversity,
   while spatial factors contributed little. Our results suggest that
   grazing enclosures decreased species diversity patterns and the spatial
   pattern of the S. breviflora desert steppe community was predictable.}},

Title = {{The Role of Herbivory in Structuring Tropical Seagrass Ecosystem Service
   Delivery}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Seagrass meadows support key ecosystem services, via provision of food
   directly for herbivores, and indirectly to their predators. The
   importance of herbivores in seagrass meadows has been well-documented,
   but the links between food webs and ecosystem services in seagrass
   meadows have not previously been made explicit. Herbivores interact with
   ecosystem services-including carbon sequestration, cultural values, and
   coastal protection. Interactions can be positive or negative and depend
   on a range of factors including the herbivore identity and the grazing
   type and intensity. There can be unintended consequences from management
   actions based on a poor understanding of trade-offs that occur with
   complex seagrass-herbivore interactions. Tropical seagrass meadows
   support a diversity of grazers spanning the meso-, macro-, and
   megaherbivore scales. We present a conceptual model to describe how
   multiple ecosystem services are influenced by herbivore pressure in
   tropical seagrass meadows. Our model suggests that a balanced ecosystem,
   incorporating both seagrass and herbivore diversity, is likely to
   sustain the broadest range of ecosystem services. Our framework suggests
   the pathway to achieve desired ecosystem services outcomes requires
   knowledge on four key areas: (1) how size classes of herbivores interact
   to structure seagrass; (2) desired community and management values; (3)
   seagrass responses to top-down and bottom-up controls; (4) the pathway
   from intermediate to final ecosystem services and human benefits. We
   suggest research should be directed to these areas. Herbivory is a major
   structuring influence in tropical seagrass systems and needs to be
   considered for effective management of these critical habitats and their
   services.}},

Title = {{Localized Agri-Food Systems and Biodiversity}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE-BASEL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Interest in localized agri-food systems has grown significantly in
   recent years. They are associated with several benefits and are seen as
   important for rural development. An important share of the academic
   debate addresses the contribution of localized food systems to the
   current and/or future sustainability of agriculture. Sustainability is
   defined in several ways, but many scholars recognize that sustainability
   can only be achieved by a combination of socio-economic, cultural, and
   environmental aspects. However, the attributes and indicators used for
   sustainability analyses also differ. Biodiversity is, for instance,
   often not included in analyses of environmental sustainability even if
   biodiversity is of crucial importance for longer-term ecological
   sustainability. To contribute to the debate about the importance of
   localized food production for sustainability from the environmental
   point of view, specifically with regard to biodiversity, this is
   therefore discussed based on the results of several studies presented in
   this paper. The studies focus on Nordic low-intensity livestock systems
   related to species-rich semi-natural grasslands. All the studies show
   that low-intensive agriculture and use of semi-natural grasslands may
   play an important role in maintaining biodiversity on both small and
   large scales. They also show that milk and dairy products from
   free-ranging livestock in heterogeneous landscapes with semi-natural
   grasslands may have a unique quality associated with local grazing
   resources. Thus, producers can combine production of food of documented
   high nutritional and gastronomic value with maintenance of biodiversity,
   i.e., localized agri-food production based on low-intensive agriculture
   systems and semi-natural grasslands may be a win-win recipe for both
   farmers and the society.}},

   forests is only weakly dispersal-limited in butterflies}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{218}},
Pages = {{32-40}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Evaluating ecological processes that assemble local animal communities
   from available species pools has remained a challenging task. At a time
   of drastic decline of natural and seminatural grasslands, contemporary
   production forests provide various novel types of open spaces
   (clear-cuts, power line corridors, etc.) that are potentially suitable
   habitats for many grassland species, such as butterflies. On the other
   hand, grassland butterflies are known to perceive forest as a dispersal
   barrier, potentially limiting the utility of such alternative habitats.
   We evaluated the role of dispersal limitation in structuring local
   butterfly assemblages in conventionally managed forest landscapes in
   which clear-cutting generates varyingly isolated transient open habitats
   within the forest matrix. We compared butterfly species richness and
   composition in clear-cuts at opposite ends of a connectivity gradient:
   sites completely surrounded by forest (isolated clear-cuts) vs. sites
   connected to the network of other forest clearings by open corridors
   (non-isolated clear-cuts). We found only a slight difference in the
   species richness between isolated and non-isolated clear-cuts, both when
   all open-habitat species and when the subset of grassland species was
   compared. The frequencies of individual butterfly species in isolated
   and non-isolated sites were strongly correlated, regardless of their
   presumed dispersal ability. Our results indicate that, in large areas of
   production forests in Northern Europe, the formation of local butterfly
   assemblages is not significantly limited by dispersal. This study
   contributes to emerging evidence that open spaces in managed forest
   landscapes can be regarded as alternative habitat for a substantial
   share of species traditionally considered to be associated with
   grasslands.}},

Title = {{Projecting global land use-driven evolutionary history loss}},
Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{158-167}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Recent studies have mapped the global hotspots hosting high
   phylogenetic diversity (PD), but not the regions where this diversity is
   under threat due to human land use. This is because, to date, it is not
   clear how much PD is lost as species of a given taxon go extinct. The
   aim of this study was to identify the global regions projected to suffer
   the highest PD loss due to human land use in the near future.
   Location: Global.
   Methods: We demonstrate a novel approach combining countryside
   species-area relationship, species-specific evolutionary distinctiveness
   (ED) scores and a newly derived strong linear relationship between the
   cumulative ED loss and PD loss through pruning simulations on global
   evolutionary trees of mammals, birds, and amphibians under random
   species loss, to project global land use-driven phylogenetic diversity
   loss in 804 terrestrial ecoregions and 175 countries. We also allocate
   the total projected PD loss to different land use types (agriculture,
   forestry, grazing or urbanization) in each region to pinpoint the major
   drivers.
   Results: For the three taxa combined, we project a total loss of 9,472
   million years (MY) of evolutionary history due to all land uses in all
   countries: 1,541 MY of mammal PD is at stake, 3,336 MY of bird PD and
   4,595 MY of amphibian PD. Agriculture is responsible for loss of 1,579
   MY; pasture 1990 MY, forestry 5,381 and urbanization 522. Land use in
   Indonesia, Colombia, India, Papua New Guinea, Madagascar and Philippines
   is projected to cause the most loss of PD.
   Main conclusions: Through the integrated approach, we can now project PD
   loss associated with species extinctions under alternative land
   conversion scenarios in a region. Overall, the results on hotspots and
   land use drivers may inform individual nations in designing regional
   strategies to achieve the international biodiversity and sustainability
   targets.}},

Abstract = {{When the Amazonian rain forest is cut to create pasture, some of the
   original vegetal species survive clearing, even expressing their ability
   to invade agro-systems. It is true of the babassu palm, which can be
   considered, paradoxically, a natural resource by the ``Interstate
   Movement of Babassu Fruit Breaker Women{''} or as native weed by land
   owners-farmers. To manage potential conflict of land uses, we study here
   the current density of this palm tree in different habitats, based on a
   combination of field data and remote sensing data. Firstly, we checked
   that the field survey methodology (i.e., counting free-trunk palm trees
   over 20 cm in circumference) provides density values compatible with
   those stemming from satellite images interpretation. We can see then
   that, a PA-Benfica Brazilian territory revealed an average density of
   the babassu lower in pastures (2.86 ind/ha) than in the dense forest
   (4.72 ind/ha) from which they originate and than in fallow land (4.31
   ind/ha). We analyze in detail density data repartition in three habitats
   and we discuss results from the literature on the density of this palm
   tree versus its resilience at different developmental stages after
   forest clearing, depending on anthropogenic-or not-factors, including
   solar radiation, fire, weeding, clear cutting, burying fruit, and
   competition with forage grass. All these results can be exploited for
   the design of future management plans for the babassu palm and we think
   that the linked methodology and interdisciplinary approach can be
   extended to others palms and trees species in similar problematic
   issues.}},

Title = {{Chronic human disturbance affects plant trait distribution in a
   seasonally dry tropical forest}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The effects of human disturbance on biodiversity can be mediated by
   environmental conditions, such as water availability, climate and
   nutrients. In general, disturbed, dry or nutrient-depleted soils areas
   tend to have lower taxonomic diversity. However, little is known about
   how these environmental conditions affect functional composition and
   intraspecific variability in tropical dry forests. We studied a
   seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) under chronic anthropogenic
   disturbance (CAD) along rainfall and soil nutrient gradients to
   understand how these factors influence the taxonomic and functional
   composition. Specifically we evaluated two aspects of CAD, wood
   extraction and livestock pressure (goat and cattle grazing), along soil
   fertility and rainfall gradients on shrub and tree traits, considering
   species turnover and intraspecific variability. In addition, we also
   tested how the traits of eight populations of the most frequent species
   are affected by wood extraction, livestock pressure, rainfall and soil
   fertility. In general, although CAD and environmental gradients affected
   each trait of the most widespread species differently, the most abundant
   species also had a greater variation of traits. Considering species
   turnover, wood extraction is associated with species with a smaller leaf
   area and lower investment in leaf mass, probably due to the indirect
   effects of this disturbance type on the vegetation, i.e. the removal of
   branches and woody debris clears the vegetation, favouring species that
   minimize water loss. Livestock pressure, on the other hand, affected
   intraspecific variation: the herbivory caused by goats and cattle
   promoted individuals which invest more in wood density and leaf mass. In
   this case, the change of functional composition observed is a direct
   effect of the disturbance, such as the decrease of palatable plant
   abundance by goat and cattle herbivory. In synthesis, CAD, rainfall and
   soil fertility can affect trait distribution at community and species
   levels, which can have significant implications for the ecosystem
   functioning of SDTF under increasing levels of disturbance, climate
   change and soil nutrient depletion.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding fire regimes in the coastal region of the Pondoland center
   of plant endemism, (Eastern Cape, South Africa) is of critical
   importance, especially in areas where anthropogenic ignitions influence
   the fire regime. We characterized the fire regime (2007 to 2016) of
   Mkambati Nature Reserve (9200 ha) in terms of fire season, seasonality
   of fire-prone weather conditions, fire return interval (FRI), and
   influence of poaching-related ignitions. Fires were concentrated in
   winter when monthly fire danger weather index was highest. The mean FRI
   at Mkambati was <3 years, but varied according to vegetation type, and
   whether censoring (for open-ended FRIs) was applied. Mean estimated FRIs
   were 2.6 yr to 3.1 yr in the majority of grassland types, 5.6 yr to 8.0
   yr in forests, and 9.0 yr to 44.4 yr in Themeda triandra Forssk.
   grass-lands. Poachers, with the intention of attracting ungulates, are
   an important source of ignitions at Mkambati. Accordingly, FRIs were
   shorter (1.99 yr to 2.08 yr) in areas within 3 km of likely poacher
   entry points than in areas farther away (2.56 yr to 2.88 yr). Although
   all fires recorded at Mkambati during the study period were of
   anthropogenic origin, mean FRI still fell within the natural range

Abstract = {{Landscape changes and resource exploitation have driven global
   biodiversity declines and reduced provision of ecological functions and
   services. In grassland working landscapes managed for ecological
   services and livestock production, it is essential to understand the
   influence of grazing practices on biodiversity to guide conservation. We
   used grassland butterflies to investigate the effects of four grazing
   management practices on biodiversity and pollination services from 2015
   to 2016. We hypothesized grazing management practices would generate
   differing floristic resources that would thereby influence grassland
   butterfly community composition. To address our hypothesis, we sampled
   floral resources using belt transects and butterfly community and
   species level dynamics using line-transect distance sampling. We
   detected 2578 butterflies representing 34 species. Management practice
   was not a significant predictor of floral (p = 0.319) or butterfly
   community composition (p = 0.604), and sites under the same management
   showed dissimilarity in ordination space, indicating differences that
   may not be associated with grazing practices. At the species level,
   management explained density for six of nine butterfly species, but no
   individual management practice was optimal for a majority of detected
   species. Thus, over the timeframe of this study, grazing management
   practices did not generate differences in floristic community
   composition to drive community-level responses in grassland butterflies.
   Rather, management drove differences in individual species' abundance
   within the butterfly community, likely contributing to the butterfly
   diversity observed at a broader scale.}},

Abstract = {{In biodiversity conservation of agriculture-driven landscapes,
   grasslands have an outstanding importance; their conservation became a
   top priority both in research and practice. In many regions, sheep or
   cattle grazing are the best options for biodiversity conservation. In
   our study, we compared the effects of cattle and sheep grazing on
   short-grass steppe vegetation under various grazing intensities. We
   tested the following study hypotheses: (i) sheep grazing maintains a
   lower taxonomic and functional diversity, lower amount of forbs compared
   with cattle grazing; and (ii) the effects of grazing are highly
   intensity dependent: the differences detected between cattle and sheep
   grazing are more pronounced at low grazing intensities than at high
   ones, because the selectivity of grazing decreases at higher
   intensities. We found lower taxonomic and functional diversity, and
   lower cover of forbs in sheep-grazed steppes compared with cattle-grazed
   ones. Grazing intensity had a significant effect only on species
   richness, while on Shannon diversity and evenness, only livestock type
   had a significant effect. While most single trait indices were affected
   by the type of the grazer, significant effect of intensity was detected
   only in few cases. These findings indicated that the selection of the
   livestock type is the most crucial in conservation; however, for proper
   ecosystem functioning and high trait variability, the suitable grazing
   intensity should also be carefully adjusted. Copyright (c) 2016 John

Abstract = {{Livestock production has been highly relevant in the Azores, boosted by
   European agricultural policies, increasing the demand for pasture and
   competing for space with other land uses. Therefore, it is important to
   understand the spatial evolution of pasture and related land use/land
   cover (LULC) trade-offs. This study describes a geographical information
   systems-based LULC change detection approach to identify, map and assess
   pasture-related land use changes and respective trade-offs in Pico
   Island in the period between 1998 and 2013 (15 years). Pasture in 1998
   occupied a total area of 17,131 ha (about 39\% of Pico Island surface),
   while in 2013, this same area was of 17,621ha (about 40\% of Pico Island
   surface). During this period, about 16,316ha of pasture remained
   unchanged, while 2,110ha (about 5\% of Pico Island surface) of land use
   have changed from pasture to another land use (810 ha), or from a
   previous land use to pasture (1,300 ha). The whole pasture spatial
   dynamics and its net increase of 3\% from 1998 to 2013 (490 ha, about
   1\% of Pico Island surface) were analysed through the identification,
   mapping and assessment of LULC trade-offs and interpreted according to
   several physical (elevation) and socio-economic/policy drivers. Pasture
   and livestock grazing activity with adequate management may not
   constitute per se threats to nature conservation and biodiversity
   protection in Pico Island, as the identified issues have been shown to
   be mostly related to the pasture dynamics (changes and respective
   trade-offs). Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{GRAZING INTENSITY AFFECTS COMMUNITIES OF CULTURABLE ROOT-ASSOCIATED
   FUNGI IN A SEMIARID GRASSLAND OF NORTHWEST CHINA}},

Abstract = {{Intensive grazing by large herbivores is known to result in the
   degeneration of grassland worldwide. However, little is known about how
   grazing affects the fungi living in roots, especially those with septate
   hyphae. We investigated grazing intensity effects on culturable
   root-associated fungi (c-RAF) of three dominant plant species; Artemisia
   capillaris, Lespedeza davurica, and Stipa bungeana, in a semiarid
   grassland of northwest China. Plant roots were sampled from four grazing
   intensities at four sampling dates. The total colonization rate of c-RAF
   was not affected by grazing intensity, but the diversity of c-RAF
   displayed a hump-shaped trend with grazing intensities. Few c-RAF were
   present in all plant species, with most of them being confined to only
   one or two plant species. The 16 most commonly isolated species were
   selected to investigate their effects on plant growth and health. Three
   Fusarium species were most pathogenic c-RAF. Three dark-sterile species
   did not affect growth parameters, regardless of host plants. With A.
   capillaris, the occurrence of Fusarium spp. was highest in the control
   plots, while with S. bungeana, the occurrence tended to increase as the
   grazing intensity increased. Two dark-sterile species, including
   Darksidea alpha, in L. davurica roots increased with grazing
   intensities; in contrast, D. alpha decreased for S. bungeana with
   grazing intensities. Our results strongly suggest that in grasslands,
   grazing intensity can lead to changes in the colonization of specific
   root fungal taxa, and these fungal changes would potentially feed back
   to plant performance depending on the abundance of host plants.

Abstract = {{Grazing and topography have drastic effects on plant communities and
   soil properties. These effects are thought to influence arbuscular
   mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. However, the simultaneous impacts of grazing
   pressure (sheep ha(-1)) and topography on plant and soil factors and
   their relationship to the production of extra-radical AM hyphae are not
   well understood. Our 10-year study assessed relationships between
   grazing, plant species richness, aboveground plant productivity, soil
   nutrients, edaphic properties, and AM hyphal length density (HLD) in
   different topographic areas (flat or sloped). We found HLD linearly
   declined with increasing grazing pressure (1.5-9.0 sheep ha(-1)) in
   sloped areas, but HLD was greatest at moderate grazing pressure (4.5
   sheep ha(-1)) in flat areas. Structural equation modeling indicates
   grazing reduces HLD by altering soil nutrient dynamics in sloped areas,
   but non-linearly influences HLD through plant community and edaphic
   changes in flat areas. Our findings highlight how topography influences
   key plant and soil factors, thus regulating the effects of grazing
   pressure on extra-radical hyphal production of AM fungi in grasslands.
   Understanding how grazing and topography influence AM fungi in semi-arid
   grasslands is vital, as globally, severe human population pressure and
   increasing demand for food aggravate the grazing intensity in
   grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{The current biodiversity decline through anthropogenic land-use not only
   involves local species losses, but also homogenization of communities,
   with a few generalist species benefitting most from human activities.
   Most studies assessed community heterogeneity (beta-diversity) on larger
   scales by comparing different sites, but little is known about impacts
   on beta-diversity within each site, which is relevant for understanding
   variation in the level of alpha-diversity, the small-scale distribution
   of species and associated habitat heterogeneity. To obtain our dataset
   with 36,899 individuals out of 117 different plant- and leafhopper
   (Auchenorrhyncha) species, we sampled communities of 140 managed
   grassland sites across Germany by quantitative vacuum suction of five 1
   m(2) plots on each site. Sites differed in land-use intensity as
   characterized by intensity of fertilization, mowing and grazing. Our
   results demonstrate a significant within-site homogenization of plant-
   and leafhopper communities with increasing land-use intensity.
   Correspondingly, density (- 78\%) and gamma-diversity (- 35\%) declined,
   particularly with fertilization and mowing intensity. More than 34\% of
   plant- and leafhopper species were significant losers and only 6\% were
   winners of high land-use intensity, with abundant and widespread species
   being less affected. Increasing land-use intensity adversely affected
   dietary specialists and promoted generalist species. Our study
   emphasizes considerable, multifaceted effects of land-use
   intensification on species loss, with a few dominant generalists
   winning, and an emerging trend towards more homogenized assemblages. By
   demonstrating homogenization for the first time within sites, our study
   highlights that anthropogenic influences on biodiversity even occur on
   small scales.}},

Abstract = {{Alpine ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to the impact of global
   climate change. Depth and duration of seasonal snow cover are major
   drivers of variation in alpine plant community composition, so a
   reduction in snow cover as a result of climate change would expose
   plants that are currently protected by snow in winter and spring to
   greater extremes of temperature and increased risk of frost damage. We
   reciprocally transplanted 64 intact 60 cm x 60 cm x 10 cm (minimum
   depth) turves of alpine vegetation among four topographic zones on the
   Rock and Pillar Range, south-central South Island, New Zealand to
   investigate how shifts along a snow cover gradient affected plant
   growth, survival and community composition. The four zones: late-melting
   snowbed and early-melting snowbed in depressions, moderately exposed
   leeward upper slopes dominated by herbfield, and extremely exposed
   summit plateau dominated by cushionfield, differed in winter and spring
   snow cover. As expected, the highest species losses occurred in turves
   transplanted to very different zones e.g. late snowbed to summit plateau
   and vice versa. However many snowbed species still survived on the
   summit plateau seven years following transplantation. The degree to
   which turves had been colonised after seven years was significantly
   related to transplant zone rather than turf origin or original species
   richness; turves transplanted to the most species-rich zones were
   affected most by colonisation. Measurements of leaf production over
   three years in three focal Celmisia species (Asteraceae), characteristic
   of the herbfield on leeward slopes, and early and late snowbeds, showed
   that the late snowbed specialist suffered significantly reduced growth
   when transplanted to more exposed sites, but its survival was more
   affected by invertebrate herbivory rather than the direct effects of
   exposure. The cosmopolitan focal lichen species Thamnolia vermicularis,
   monitored over 14 years, rapidly colonised turves transplanted to
   cushionfield on the exposed summit plateau, where this and other lichens
   are abundant, but equally rapidly declined in turves transplanted to
   snowbeds. These findings add to a growing body of evidence that biotic
   interactions and species-specific traits will be critical drivers of
   alpine vegetation change under future climate scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Forests dominated by Polylepis pauta occur in humid environments in the
   high Andes of Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, at elevations between 3500-4500
   m. Polylepis forests host a unique biodiversity of plants and animals
   and are an important supply of resources for local people. However,
   these forests are being destroyed by extensive burning practices,
   causing the replacement of the forest by grassland and favoring cattle
   grazing. As a consequence, Polylepis forests have become severely
   diminished and fragmented, and are considered as one of the most
   threatened ecosystems in South America. The vascular flora of Ecuadorian
   P. pauta forests has been documented in detail but little is known about
   bryophytes of these forests. This paper deals with the liverwort flora
   of remnant P. pauta forests in the paramo of Papallacta near Quito,
   Ecuador. The forest floor and trunk bases were almost completely covered
   by Lepidozia auriculata and four robust Plagiochila species (P.
   dependula, P. ensiformis, P. fuscolutea, P. ovata). Frullania paradoxa,
   Leptoscyphus hexagonus, Plagiochila bifaria and P. punctata were
   abundant on branches of Polylepis trees. In total 51 liverworts were
   recorded, being the highest number of liverwort species reported from
   Polylepis forest. Leptoscyphus leoniae Gradst. and Plagiochila
   pautaphila Gradst. \& Leon-Yanez are new to science.}},

Abstract = {{Edaphic biota significantly affects several essential ecological
   functions such as C-storage, nutrient turnover, and productivity.
   However, it is not completely understood how belowground animal
   contribution to these functions changes in grasslands subject to
   different land use types. A microcosm experiment was carried out to test
   the effect of a tritrophic food chain on CO2 release from grassland
   soils. Soil was collected from three differently managed grassland
   systems (meadow, pasture, and mown pasture) located in three distinct
   German regions that cover a north-south gradient of approximately 500
   km. The tritrophic food chain comprised natural edaphic microflora,
   nematodes, and predatory gamasid mites. The experimental design involved
   a full factorial combination of the presence and absence of nematodes
   and gamasid mites. Nematodes significantly increased the CO2 emissions
   in most treatments, but the extent of this effect varied with land use
   type. The fact that grazing by nematodes stimulated the metabolic
   activity of the edaphic microflora over a wide range of grassland soils
   highlighted the critical impact of the microfauna on ecosystem services
   associated with soil organic matter dynamics. Gamasids slightly
   amplified the effect of nematodes on microbial metabolic activity, but
   only in the pastures. This effect was most probably due to the control
   of nematode abundance. The fact that gamasid addition also augmented the
   impact of environmental conditions on nematode-induced modulation of
   soil respiration highlighted the need for including land use differences
   while evaluating soil fauna contribution to soil processes. To conclude,
   the differential response of the investigated tritrophic food chain to
   different grassland management systems suggests that adverse effects of
   land use intensification on important soil processes such as atmospheric
   C-release could potentially be reduced by using management methods that
   preserve essential features of the belowground food web.}},

Abstract = {{In alpine environments, very low and very high amounts of soil nutrients
   are generally associated to the lowest plant diversity and forage
   quality levels. Both soil nutrient content and forage quality and
   productivity of a site can be inferred from plant species lists, by
   attributing each species a nutrient indicator value (N value) and a
   quality value, and computing respectively average N Value and Pastoral
   Value (PV) at site scale. We used a wide dataset of vegetation surveys
   carried out in the pastures of Western Italian Alps to 1) evaluate if N
   values, PV, and plant diversity (species richness and Shannon diversity
   index) change along an elevation gradient, from montane/sub-alpine
   pastures (i.e. the ones located below treeline) to alpine pastures
   (above treeline), 2) analyze the relationships between N value and plant
   diversity indexes and between N value and PV, and 3) evaluate whether
   the N values associated to the highest plant diversity and PV differ.
   Plant diversity, PV, and N values were higher in the pastures located at
   lower elevation. Plant diversity and PV showed a unimodal relation with
   N values, both in the montane/sub-alpine and alpine belts. Plant
   diversity indexes peaked at intermediate N indicator values, confirming
   the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, while PV peaked at higher N
   values, where higher nutrient availability in the soil increased plant
   species productivity, growth rate, leaf turnover and nutrient
   concentration, digestibility, and palatability. The overall shape of the
   curves as well as the N values at which plant diversity and PV values
   peaked did not considerably change from montane/sub-alpine to alpine
   pastures. These results suggest that an extensive pastoral management is
   recommended when plant diversity conservation is the main goal.
   Conversely, a more intensive management can produce an overall
   enhancement of forage quality/productivity of alpine pastures, but only
   if restricted under certain critical N values.}},

Journal = {{MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{14-23}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Summer farms are seasonal enterprises in high-elevation mountain
   regions, established for and highly specialized in grazing ruminants.
   This article synthesizes studies by the Swiss AlpFUTUR research program
   on the profitability of and public financial support for summer farms.
   It highlights current challenges of Swiss pastoralism and makes
   recommendations for future reforms. Profitability hinges on the size of
   the summer farms as well as on their ability to create value added.
   Particularly for smaller summer farms, key value-added strategies appear
   to be innovative cheese production and effective direct marketing.
   Public financial support is substantial, and the underlying
   agri-environmental scheme is relatively sophisticated. Eligibility for
   public support is based on both action-oriented and results-oriented
   criteria. Direct payments consider not only the number of livestock but
   also the duration of their presence on the summer pastures. For each
   summer farm, a stocking target is defined based on the pasture's
   carrying capacity. However, this target does not take into account the
   wide variation in forage needs between different meat and milk
   production systems. During the last decade, there has been a decline in
   the number of cattle sent to summer farms. Understocking is widespread,
   and the abandonment of marginal pastures has increased, resulting in
   scrub encroachment. The remaining cattle tend to be concentrated on more
   productive surfaces to reduce management costs; this causes overgrazing.
   More attention should therefore be given to the accurate enforcement of
   agri-environmental standards and to regional-level agreement on which
   surfaces should be abandoned. Supporting traditional pastoral practices
   remains an explicit objective of Swiss agricultural policy. Recently
   introduced agri-environmental payment schemes promoting biodiversity
   conservation can complement the summer farm subsidies. However,
   implementation costs are likely to increase.}},

Title = {{Plant diversity effects on arthropods and arthropod-dependent ecosystem
   functions in a biodiversity experiment}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{50-63}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity-ecosystem function experiments test how species diversity
   influences fundamental ecosystem processes. Historically, arthropod
   driven functions, such as herbivory and pest-control, have been thought
   to be influenced by direct and indirect associations among species.
   Although a number of studies have evaluated how plant diversity affects
   arthropod communities and arthropod-mediated ecosystem processes, it
   remains unclear whether diversity effects on arthropods are sufficiently
   consistent over time such that observed responses can be adequately
   predicted by classical hypotheses based on associational effects. By
   combining existing results from a long-term grassland biodiversity
   experiment (Jena Experiment) with new analyses, we evaluate the
   consistency of consumer responses within and across taxonomic, trophic,
   and trait-based (i.e. vertical stratification) groupings, and we
   consider which changes in arthropod community composition are associated
   with changes in consumer-mediated ecosystem functions.
   Overall, higher plant species richness supported more diverse and
   complex arthropod communities and this pattern was consistent across
   multiple years. Vegetation-associated arthropods responded more strongly
   to changes in plant species richness than ground-dwelling arthropods.
   Additionally, increases in plant species richness were associated with
   shifts in the species-abundance distributions for many, but not all
   taxa. For example, highly specialized consumers showed a decrease in
   dominance and an increase in the number of rare species with increasing
   plant species richness. Most ecosystem processes investigated responded
   to increases in plant species richness in the same way as the trophic
   group mediating the process, e.g. both herbivory and herbivore diversity
   increase with increasing plant species richness. In the Jena Experiment
   and other studies, inconsistencies between predictions based on classic
   hypotheses of associational effects and observed relationships between
   plant species richness and arthropod diversity likely reflect the
   influence of multi-trophic community dynamics and species functional
   trait distributions. Future research should focus on testing a broader
   array of mechanisms to unravel the biological processes underlying the
   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. (C) 2017 Gesellschaft

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{The decline of open habitats in Europe, such as semi-natural grasslands
   and heathlands, has caused a general decline in biodiversity, which has
   been well documented for butterflies. Current conservation practices
   often involve grazing by domestic livestock to maintain suitable
   butterfly habitats. The extent to which wild ungulates may play a
   similar role remains largely unknown. Through their rooting activity,
   wild boar could be effective to reduce grass encroachment and restore
   pioneer microhabitats that are vital to many grassland insects in
   temperate climates. Here, we assessed the microhabitat requirements of
   Pyrgus malvae, an endangered butterfly of heathland and grassland
   habitats in the Netherlands, with special attention for the influence of
   wild boar rooting. To date, oviposition site selection of this species
   has concentrated on calcareous grasslands, whereas we also include
   heathlands. Overall, larval occupancy was higher in warm, open and
   sparsely vegetated microhabitats, which supports earlier findings. In
   heathland, microhabitat occupancy was positively affected by bryophyte
   and litter cover. In heath-grassland mosaic, microhabitat occupancy was
   also influenced by bryophyte and litter cover, but in addition low grass
   cover increased occupancy by favouring host plants. In grassland, only
   low grass cover and host plant cover determined microhabitat quality.
   Across all habitats, occupied microhabitats were characterized by lower
   vegetation as well as higher average daytime temperatures than
   unoccupied microhabitats. We discovered that wild boar play an important
   role in reducing grass cover by shallow rooting in grass patches,
   thereby increasing host plant availability. Hence, wild boar may have an
   added value in maintaining and restoring P. malvae microhabitats in
   grassland habitats in addition to grazing by domestic livestock.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory is an important factor to generate spatial mosaics with

   objective of this work was to determine the impact of Atta vollenweideri
   Forel 1893 nests on herbaceous and shrub vegetation in a degraded native
   forest of the Espinal ecoregion. The study was carried out in the
   Protected Area and Multiple Use Nature Reserve called Estancia ``El
   Caraya{''} (Entre Rios, Argentina). Ten A. vollenweideri nests were
   selected by simple random sampling through internal roads, and two
   transects were drawn from the center of the nest (0 m) up to 60 m away
   in opposite directions. The line intercept method was used to quantify
   the percentage of vegetation cover of herbaceous and shrub species,
   while the floristic composition was estimated by the Canfield method.
   Afterwards, a nonparametric test between positions and a conglomerate
   analysis to evaluated distance were applied. Grass species, legumes, and
   sedges fell in the adjacent areas to nests, highlighting the bare soil
   at the crest and base of the nests. Fifteen plant species were
   identified, and two families correspond to monocotyledonous and
   dicotyledonous species. In conclusion, the nests of A. vollenweideri
   affect the community of herbaceous and shrub vegetation of the studied
   degraded native forest of the Espinal ecoregion since these ants perform
   a high selection of herbaceous species considered as pioneers of plant
   successions.}},

Abstract = {{In Southern Patagonia, a long-term monitoring network has been
   established to assess bio-indicators as an early warning of
   environmental changes due to climate change and human activities. Soil
   organic carbon (SOC) content in rangelands provides a range of important
   ecosystem services and supports the capacity of the land to sustain
   plant and animal productivity. The objectives in this study were to
   model SOC (30 cm) stocks at a regional scale using climatic, topographic
   and vegetation variables, and to establish a baseline that can be used
   as an indicator of rangeland condition. For modelling, we used a
   stepwise multiple regression to identify variables that explain SOC
   variation at the landscape scale. With the SOC model, we obtained a SOC
   map for the entire Santa Cruz province, where the variables derived from
   the multiple linear regression models were integrated into a geographic
   information system (GIS). SOC stock to 30 cm ranged from 1.38 to 32.63
   kg C m(-2). The fitted model explained 76.4\% of SOC variation using as
   independent variables isothermality, precipitation seasonality and
   vegetation cover expressed as a normalized difference vegetation index.
   The SOC map discriminated in three categories (low, medium, high)
   determined patterns among environmental and land use variables. For
   example, SOC decreased with desertification due to erosion processes.
   The understanding and mapping of SOC in Patagonia contributes as a
   bridge across main issues such as climate change, desertification and
   biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Soil degradation phenomena, including water erosion and physical and
   biological processes, have already been reported in rangelands of
   southwestern Spain. The increasing numbers of livestock since 1986 have
   been highlighted as one of the key causes. The main goal of this work is
   to analyse the effects of the excessive number of animals on soil
   quality and pasture production on privately owned farms dedicated to
   extensive ranching. Soil properties and surface cover, pasture
   production, rainfall and land management variables such as livestock
   density were analysed during a period of 3years (2008-2011). The study
   was carried out in 22 livestock enclosures selected from ten farms
   distributed throughout the Spanish region of Extremadura. The occurrence
   of bare soil patches and water erosion processes, as well as an increase
   of mean bulk density in the soil layer from 5 to 10 cm in depth, was
   observed in the enclosures with animal stocking rates exceeding
   1AUha(-1). Indications that confirm the negative effects of increased
   bulk density on pasture production and quality were also found.

Abstract = {{Significant loss of pollinator taxa and their interactions with
   flowering plants has resulted in growing reductions to pollination
   services globally. Ecological network analysis is a useful tool for
   evaluating factors that alter the interaction structure and resistance
   of systems to species loss, but is rarely applied across multiple
   empirical networks sampled within the same study. The non-random
   arrangement of species interactions within a community, or ``network
   structure{''} such as nested or modular organization, is predicted to
   prevent extinction cascades in ecological networks. How ecological
   gradients such as disturbance regimes shape network structural
   properties remains poorly understood despite significant efforts to
   quantify interaction structure in natural systems. Here, we examine
   changes in the structure of plant-floral visitor networks in a tallgrass
   prairie using a decadal and landscape-scale experiment that manipulates
   prescribed burn frequency and ungulate grazing, resulting in different
   grassland states. Plant and floral visitor communities and accompanying
   network structure were impacted by grassland fire and grazing regimes.
   The presence of grazers increased flowering plant species richness,
   network floral visitor species richness, and decreased network
   nestedness. Fire frequency affected flowering plant and floral visitor
   community composition; community composition impacted network
   specialization and modularity. Grassland state resulting from
   fire-grazing interactions has important implications for the resistance
   of flowering plant and floral visitor communities to species loss.}},

Title = {{Plant genotype identity and diversity interact with mesograzer species
   diversity to influence detrital consumption in eelgrass meadows}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{327-336}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Seagrass meadows are among the world's most productive ecosystems, and
   as in many other systems, genetic diversity is correlated with increased
   production. However, only a small fraction of seagrass production is
   directly consumed, and instead much of the secondary production is
   fueled by the detrital food web. Here, we study the roles of plant
   genetic diversity and grazer species diversity on detrital consumption
   in California eelgrass Zostera marina meadows. We used three common
   mesograzersan amphipod, Ampithoe lacertosa, an isopod, Idotea resecata,
   and a polychaete, Platynereis bicanaliculata. Each grazer consumed
   eelgrass detritus at rates greater than live eelgrass or macroalgae.
   This detrital consumption, however, was not spread evenly over leaves
   shed from different eelgrass clones. Palatability and consumption varied
   because of genotype specific differences in leaf texture, secondary
   metabolites (phenolics), and nutritional quality (nitrogen). Further,
   detritus derived from some eelgrass genotypes was palatable to all
   grazers, while detritus from other genotypes was preferentially consumed
   by only one grazer species. Under monospecific grazer assemblages, plant
   genetic identity but not diversity influenced detritus consumption.
   However, more realistic, diverse mesoconsumer communities combined with
   high plant-detrital genotypic diversity resulted in greater consumption
   and grazer survival. These results provide a mechanism for field
   observations of increased mesograzer density and diversity in
   genetically diverse seagrass assemblages and offer a potential
   explanation for variation in results of resource diversity- detrital
   processing experiments in the literature, which often exclude
   macroinvertebrate taxa. More broadly, our findings support the emerging
   principle that biodiversity effects are strongest when diversity in both
   consumer and resource taxa are present.}},

Title = {{Can root trait diversity explain complementarity effects in a grassland
   biodiversity experiment?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{73-84}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   The positive relationship between plant biodiversity and community
   productivity is well established. However, our knowledge about the
   mechanisms underlying these positive biodiversity effects is still
   limited. One of the main hypotheses is that complementarity in resource
   uptake is responsible for the positive biodiversity effects: plant
   species differ in resource uptake strategy, which results in a more
   complete exploitation of the available resources in space and time when
   plant species are growing together. Recent studies suggest that
   functional diversity of the community, i.e. the diversity in functional
   characteristics ('traits') among species, rather than species richness
   per se, is important for positive biodiversity effects. However,
   experimental evidence for specific trait combinations underlying
   resource complementarity is scarce. As the root system is responsible
   for the uptake of nutrients and water, we hypothesize that diversity in
   root traits may underlie complementary resource use and contribute to
   the biodiversity effects.
   Methods
   In a common garden experiment, 16 grassland species were grown in
   monoculture, 4-species mixtures differing in root trait diversity and
   16-species mixtures. The 4-species mixtures were designed to cover a
   gradient in average rooting depth. Above-ground biomass was cut after
   one growing season and used as a proxy for plant productivity to
   calculate biodiversity effects.
   Important Findings
   Overall, plant mixtures showed a significant increase in biomass and
   complementarity effects, but this varied greatly between communities.
   However, diversity in root traits (measured in a separate greenhouse
   experiment and based on literature) could not explain this variation in
   complementarity effects. Instead, complementarity effects were strongly
   affected by the presence and competitive interactions of two particular
   species. The large variation in complementarity effects and significant
   effect of two species emphasizes the importance of community composition
   for positive biodiversity effects. Future research should focus on
   identifying the traits associated with the key role of particular
   species for complementarity effects. This may increase our understanding
   of the links between functional trait composition and biodiversity
   effects as well as the relative importance of resource complementarity
   and other underlying mechanisms for the positive biodiversity effects.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the influence of anthropogenic drivers on the distribution
   and regeneration of tree species in vegetation at different stages of
   succession from grasslands to oak forests in mid-montane Central
   Himalaya. We found fire, grazing, and lopping as the main factors
   hindering a progressive successional regime towards a late-successional
   oak community. Succession was studied in five vegetation formations
   (grasslands, pine, pine-oak, open oak, and dense oak), with similar site
   conditions, representing a theoretical successional sequence from early-
   to late-successional stages. A structured survey with uniform
   distribution of sampling plots in the five selected vegetation
   formations was conducted to gather information abut the vegetation
   communities. Early-successional grasslands and pine forests were found
   to harbour high densities of pine and oak seedling and sapling
   regeneration. However, recurring fires and chronic unsustainable levels
   of grazing in these vegetation formations obstructed progressive
   succession by eliminating regenerating seedling and saplings from the
   forest understorey. Similarly, in intermediate- and late-successional
   stages (including pine-oak, open oak, and dense oak), overexploitation
   of existing oaks trees via lopping and grazing of regenerating oak
   seedlings and saplings hampered oak regeneration and development. The
   possibility to convert pine forests into oak as well as the conservation
   of existing oak forests through controlled grazing and lopping are
   management options that can contribute to an enhanced functioning of
   forest ecosystems in the study area. We conclude that with strategic
   management that restricts the current anthropogenic disturbances, the
   extent of oak forest in the study area can be increased.}},

Abstract = {{Impacts on birds of intensive management practices and of landscape
   simplification have been widely studied, but there is a lack of
   knowledge about impacts on birds of landscapes associated with intensive
   livestock production. The objective of this work was to investigate
   changes in several bird community descriptors along different production
   gradients. Production of amble crops and from grazing livestock was
   computed over French agroecosystems and expressed in terms of edible
   energy. Using data from the French Breeding Bird Survey along with data
   from national agricultural statistics, we modeled the relationship
   between production and five bird community descriptors, namely,
   community trophic index, community specialization index, and three group
   specific species richness indices. Bird communities were shaped by two
   production gradients. Along a gradient of increasing crop production, we
   observed a shift from locally species-diverse communities dominated by
   generalist or grassland specialist species towards species-poor
   communities dominated by granivorous species specialized in arable
   habitats (all p-values <= 0.002). Second, we observed a shift towards
   homogenized communities dominated by generalists along a gradient of
   increasing livestock production (p-values 0.001). Our research
   highlights the need to consider crop and livestock separately when
   investigating their impacts on biodiversity. It also hints towards the
   need for differentiated strategies to protect farmland birds in crop
   regions and in livestock regions.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands are characteristic elements of mountain
   landscapes across the world. However, a significant decrease in their
   area has been observed in many places in Europe. This phenomenon leads
   to many negative consequences, which is why meadows and pastures are
   managed for conservation purposes in most European countries, especially
   in protected areas. The aim of this study is to identify the challenges
   for the management of semi-natural grasslands in the national parks of
   the Polish Carpathians with a special focus on the implementation of
   conservation measures. The study highlights also attitudes of local
   communities towards the conservation of semi-natural grasslands as well
   as motivations guiding the residents to support conservation activities.
   According to interviews conducted with parks' employees six key
   categories of challenges have been distinguished. They are associated
   with the land ownership structure, financing and implementation of
   conservation measures, planning and evaluation of applied treatments,
   and natural and social determinants. Only some of the challenges result
   exclusively from the mountainous conditions or refer directly to the
   effectiveness of the conservation measures. Most of the challenges are
   typical of those found in national parks throughout the world and are
   connected with legislative and financial issues. The results of
   interviews showed that implementation of conservation measures in
   difficult, mountainous conditions, and their labour consumption pose the
   biggest challenge. A significant problem is also the removal of mown
   biomass. The possibility of efficient conservation of semi-natural
   grasslands is in many cases limited by advanced processes of secondary
   forest succession, complicated ownership relations and difficult
   procedures of obtaining funds for the active conservation. The attitudes
   of local communities towards the conservation of semi-natural grasslands
   are different in individual national parks. The residents supporting the
   conservation activities are guided by aesthetic and scenic, historical
   and cultural as well as financial motivations.}},

Abstract = {{Wood-pastures are special types of agroforestry systems that integrate
   trees with livestock grazing. Wood pastures can be hotspots for large
   old tree abundance and have exceptional natural values; but they are
   declining all over Europe. While presence of large old trees in
   wood-pastures can provide arguments for their maintenance, actual data
   on their distribution and abundance are sparse. Our study is the first
   to survey large old trees in Eastern Europe over such a large area. We
   surveyed 97 wood-pastures in Transylvania (Romania) in order to (i)
   provide a descriptive overview of the large old tree abundance; and (ii)
   to explore the environmental determinants of the abundance and
   persistence of large old trees in wood-pastures. We identified 2520
   large old trees belonging to 16 taxonomic groups. Oak was present in
   66\% of the wood-pastures, followed by beech (33\%), hornbeam (24\%) and
   pear (22\%). For each of these four species we constructed a generalized
   linear model with quasi-Poisson error distribution to explain individual
   tree abundance. Oak trees were most abundant in large wood-pastures and
   in wood-pastures from the Saxon cultural region of Transylvania. Beech
   abundance related positively to elevation and to proximity of human
   settlements. Abundance of hornbeam was highest in large wood-pastures,
   in wood-pastures from the Saxon cultural region, and in places with high
   cover of adjacent forest and a low human population density. Large old
   pear trees were most abundant in large wood-pastures that were close to
   paved roads. The maintenance of large old trees in production landscapes
   is a challenge for science, policy and}},

Abstract = {{Linking the conservation of cultural heritage and natural values
   provides a unique opportunity for preserving traditional landscapes and
   receives an increased awareness from stakeholders and society. Ancient
   burial mounds are proper objects of such projects as they are iconic
   landscape elements of the Eurasian steppes and often act as refugia for
   grassland specialist species. The aim of this project was to reintroduce
   grassland plant species to burial mounds for representing them as
   cultural monuments with the associated biodiversity for the public. The
   effectiveness of seed sowing, transplanting greenhouse-grown plants and
   individuals from threatened populations on burial mounds in Hortobagy
   National Park, Hungary was tested. The following questions were
   answered: (1) which method is the most effective for species
   introduction? (2) which species can establish most successfully? (3) how
   does management affect the species establishment rates? It was found
   advisable to use a combination of seed sowing and transplanting
   greenhouse-grown plants. Sowing was found as a cost-effective method for
   introducing large-seeded species, whilst introduction of
   greenhouse-grown transplants warranted higher establishment rates for a
   larger set of species. Transplanting adult individuals was more reliable
   regardless of management regimes, however this method is
   labour-intensive and expensive. Intensive management, like mowing with
   heavy machinery and intensive grazing, should be avoided in the first
   few years after introduction. The authors highlighted the fact that
   introducing characteristic grassland species on cultural monuments
   offers a great opportunity to link issues of landscape and biodiversity
   conservation. This project demonstrated that, by the revitalisation of
   cultural monuments, cultural ecosystem services can also be restored.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional pastoral practices in Kyrgyzstan have been transformed into
   more intensive forms of pastoral land use during the Soviet colonial
   period, and once again modified after independence in 1991. Kyrgyz
   winter pastures close to settlements are subject to degradation
   processes, while remote summer pastures are less affected. It is largely
   unknown to what extent current grazing regimes, repeatedly modified
   during the post-Soviet transformation process, have influenced plant
   species diversity of mountain pastures. This paper aims to analyze
   inventory (alpha) and differentiation (beta) diversity of pastures in
   the Naryn Oblast, where winter pastures are subject to increased grazing
   pressure. We used a non-asymptotic approach in order to infer Hill
   numbers, i.e. the effective number of species at different levels of q
   (where q = 0: species richness, q = 1: Shannon diversity, q = 2: Simpson
   diversity) to make fair comparisons among assemblages of winter and
   summer pastures. We established sample-size-based rarefaction
   (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) curves, and assessed beta
   diversity by implementing an ANOSIM and by calculating Jaccard and
   Sorensen indices. We also inspected the occurrence of rare endemic
   plants, which might play a key role in local ecosystem processes and are
   important for biodiversity conservation. Increased grazing pressure on
   winter pastures mainly results from abandoned seasonal livestock
   migration and unbalanced grazing intensity between seasonal pastures.
   Our results show that inventory diversity is higher on summer pastures
   and that species composition between summer and winter pastures differs
   significantly. Winter pastures are less species-rich but have a higher
   percentage of rare endemic species.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter reviews contributions made to agricultural and
   environmental science and practice from research on temperate grassland
   carried out from 1982 to present at Rothamsted Research's North Wyke
   Research Station, Devon, UK. It describes the evolution of the research
   program and demonstrates the importance of sustained, interdisciplinary,
   and collaborative research. North Wyke has maintained a clear research
   focus, alongside an ability to adapt to changing grassland and
   environmental research needs and funding sources, and despite having
   changed affiliations on several occasions. The substantial contribution
   to agricultural and environmental science arising from the research
   station has influenced and continues to influence farm practice,
   research, and policy nationally and internationally. Some key topics
   have included nutrient cycling, farm waste management, gaseous
   emissions, biodiversity, grazing management, animal production (meat and
   milk), and forage quality. Currently, North Wyke Research Station is
   leading the way on taking increasingly holistic approaches to
   researching more efficient, sustainable approaches to grazing-livestock
   agricultural production. This involves the use of world-leading,
   facilities such as the North Wyke Farm Platform, comprising three
   farmlets, designed to test the productivity and environmental
   sustainability of contrasting temperate grassland beef and sheep
   systems. Future perspectives highlight key challenges facing the
   agricultural industry including climate change mitigation and
   adaptation, and the growing world population. Opportunities exist to
   tackle these challenges through technological advances, but also through
   increased integration of agricultural, environmental, economic and
   social research. North Wyke Research Station provides an example of a
   research facility where such challenges can be addressed.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by large mammals alters vegetation physiognomy, consequently
   changing habitat suitability for small mammal communities. We
   investigated the response of terrestrial small mammals to grazing by
   wild and domesticated ungulates at the boundary of a protected area
   (Telperion Nature Reserve) and surrounding cattle ranches in Mpumalanga.
   South Africa over two seasons. Fifteen paired grids were set on either
   side of the boundary fence at which small mammals were trapped in
   Sherman live traps placed flat on the ground. A total of 11 760 trap
   nights resulted in the capture of 187 animals belonging to 14 species
   (11 rodents, two shrews and one elephant shrew). The small mammal
   communities in grasslands grazed by domesticated or wild ungulates were
   similar in abundance, species richness, diversity and demographic
   parameters, likely due to the fact that vegetation structure of the two
   grazing systems was also similar. We used generalised linear models to
   show that rock and grass cover were plausible predictors of small mammal
   abundance in this system. Rock cover showed a positive relationship with
   small mammal abundance whilst grass cover showed a negative
   relationship. Our observations suggest that at the scale of our study
   and with the current stocking densities, wild and domesticated ungulates
   have similar impacts on the small mammal community.}},

Title = {{Smart management is key for successful diversification of field margins

Abstract = {{In highly productive farmlands, field margins could offer habitats and
   refuges for many plant and animal species. But species-rich field
   margins are rapidly declining due to field enlargements and unfavourable
   management practices. In European farmland, management is usually
   restricted to repeated mulching during the growing season or mulching
   once a year between September and February. Under nutrient-rich
   conditions, both methods benefit competitive perennial grasses at the
   expense of species richness. Diversification of species-poor grass
   margins on nutrient-rich sites is difficult to achieve and we lack
   evidence which method works best. Starting in late summer 2010, we
   implemented a large-scale field experiment on nutrient-rich Chernozem
   soil, where we examined the effect of sward disturbance intensity,
   sowing of target species, and mowing time on the development of field
   margin vegetation over seven years. After disturbance of the existing
   species-poor grass sward with two intensities (tilling once or three
   times), a seed mixture of 49 wild plants from a regional seed
   propagation was sown in early October 2010. After an establishment phase
   in 2011, the sites were mown once a year, in either June or September,
   with removal of biomass. In addition, both cutting times were applied to
   species poor grass margins without disturbance and sowing treatments. We
   recorded the plant species composition yearly from 2010 until 2016.
   Although the early establishment rate of the sown species was higher on
   sites disturbed three times, the number of successfully established
   target species on sites with different sward disturbance intensities
   converged during the observation period. Mowing in September resulted in
   higher grass cover and considerably decreased the cover of the sown
   target species. On the other hand, mowing in June resulted in
   significantly higher plot occupancy and cover of the sown target
   species. In general, the immigration success of target forbs into
   adjacent undisturbed and unsown grass margins was very low even after
   seven years, although mowing once a year with biomass removal increased
   the number of mostly ruderal species. Diversification of grass margins
   was very successful with active species introduction in combination with
   initial sward disturbance and management adapted to nutrient-rich site
   conditions. Therefore, restored field margins in highly productive
   farmlands should be mown in early simmer to sustain long-term
   biodiversity.}},

Journal = {{AIMS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{A core task in biodiversity conservation is to protect and restore
   populations of endangered species. The analysis of causes of decline
   based on data sampled in declining populations in sub-optimal habitats
   risks overlooking necessary environmental factors because they are no
   longer present at the sites. It may therefore be necessary to search for
   conditions that were present before the species began to decline. We
   used an historical ecology approach to identify critical ecological
   needs for the endangered butterfly Clouded Apollo, Parnassius mnemosyne,
   in Sweden in relation to historical and current land use. The most
   suitable habitat structure and management was transformed into a plan
   for restoration and management, applied at two P. mnemosyne sites. The
   populations of P. mnemosyne and its host-plant, Corydalis solida, were
   monitored annually 2004-2014. Based on previous knowledge about P.
   mnemosyne, the Swedish plan for conservation of the species recommends
   regular clearings of shrubs and trees in order to maintain a mosaic
   tree-grassland habitat, and a limited of removal of ground biomass. Our
   analysis suggested an alternative management approach, late and rather
   intense grazing. The populations of P. mnemosyne and its host plant
   increased in response to this management regime and the butterfly
   started dispersing to new sites. We suggest a structured method for
   combining ecological and historical knowledge, which can reveal habitat
   conditions difficult to detect in the field today, but that are of
   crucial importance for successful species conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term effects of horse grazing on spider assemblages of a dry
   meadow (Western France). In this study, the biodiversity impacts of a
   little studied herbivore, the horse, were assessed in a high
   conservation value habitat of dry meadows in Brittany (Western France).
   Spiders, a diversified and abundant group of predators, were used as
   bioindicators. Three complementary sampling techniques were used to
   assess changes in spider assemblages in both soil and vegetation strata,
   over time (diachronic comparison of managed unit before vs. after
   management) and space (synchronic comparison of managed vs. control
   units). Few effects of grazing, i.e. only one significantly indicative
   species, were found on assemblage composition (ANOSIM), and none on
   abundances, alpha- and beta-diversities (GLM on pitfall trap data). On
   the contrary, important differences were found between units before
   management took place. The main effects of grazing management were
   revealed over time (after one year), and not between managed and control
   units (CCA on pitfall trap data and x y -tests on guilds from each
   sampling method), showing the relevance of a diachronic approach more
   than a synchronic approach in such management monitoring. Grazing by
   horses could be relevant to manage meadows because it creates a high
   spatial heterogeneity, but further (long-term) studies including other
   model groups are required.}},

Abstract = {{The role of semi-natural grasslands and livestock in sustaining dung

   habitat patches characterised by different levels of grazing (S1, the
   active part of the pasture; S2, the overgrown part of the pasture,
   mainly spiny shrubs; S3, a meadow with some overgrown patches of shrubs
   outside the fenced pasture). The main results were as follows: (1) 29
   species were sampled, corresponding to about three quarters of the
   species presumably present at the two study sites; (2) species richness
   and abundance in Zazid are were similar in all three patches; (3) the
   species richness and abundance in Hrastovlje (in total, and separately
   for dwellers and tunnelers) were highest in S2. In Hrastovlje, dwellers
   were most abundant in S1. As the two different habitat patches were

Abstract = {{QuestionsCan drainage ditches in agricultural marsh grassland provide a
   suitable habitat for the persistence of fen meadow species? How does the
   ditch margin vegetation develop as a function of regular dredging? Is
   ornithologically oriented management also beneficial for plant
   biodiversity?
   LocationRiparian marshes, Eider-Treene-Sorge lowland,
   Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.
   MethodsWe performed vegetation surveys of drainage ditches along with
   their water body, slope and margin structures annually for 3years. The
   data were analysed with respect to date and means of ditch dredging. In
   addition, we recorded vegetation of the surrounding agricultural
   grassland, measured nutrient status of the soil and the water body and
   sampled seed bank of the ditch slopes. We used ANOVA and multivariate
   methods to describe the development of the ditch vegetation and the
   persistence of target meadow species.
   ResultsVegetation re-development of ditch margins proceeds quite rapidly
   after disturbance from dredging. Dominance of mudbank species was
   observed only in the first year, followed by an increase of reed species
   and reduction of phytodiversity. Target species of wet meadow
   communities reach highest abundance in the second and third year and
   build a significant seed bank before being suppressed by reeds.
   ConclusionsIn heavily eutrophicated, intensively used marsh grassland,
   regularly disturbed ditch margins are important secondary habitats for
   pioneer and subdominant wetland species, which have nearly disappeared
   in a larger area. Current management cycles of ditch dredging every
   3-4years comply with the successional development, allowing the mudbank
   and wet meadow species to persist in the vegetation and seed bank. In
   contrast to the frequency, the form of dredging (ditch profile), which
   is crucial for bird protection, plays a minor role for plants. We
   recommend moderate disturbance (mowing of ditch margins) to suppress
   strong competitors in the years between dredging for additional support
   to target plant species.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsManagement practices implemented on road verges are partly
   established to preserve biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. Their
   evaluation was primarily based on the analysis of the taxonomic
   structure and composition of communities. What is the relationship
   between management practices and the functional characteristics of
   road-field plants within elements?
   LocationWest-central France.
   MethodsWe sampled the berm, the embankment and the field margin of 40
   road-field boundaries located in west-central France, an area where
   delayed mowing of some berms has been practised since 2009 for
   biodiversity reasons. We characterized management practices implemented
   on the different elements, i.e., the frequency and timing of mowing
   (early summer or late summer), the frequency of herbicide treatment in
   field margins and the N input rate. We retrieved from databases seven
   functional traits and types known to be influenced by management
   practices. To identify relationships between traits or types and
   environmental variables we first performed partial RLQ analyses to
   remove any potential confounding effect of the landscape context
   studied. We then computed fourth-corner statistics to quantify
   relationships between traits or types, environmental variables and
   partial RLQ axes.
   ResultsLate mowing of the berm promoted nitrophilous species within
   berms and competitive rather than ruderal species within arable field
   margins. The frequency of herbicide treatment in field margins promoted
   broad-leaf species within this element and, to a lesser extent, within
   embankments. Finally, the functional characteristics of communities of
   the three elements were not influenced by the level of N input in field
   margins.
   ConclusionsIn our environmental context, managing road verges affected
   the functional structure of plant assemblages both within them and
   within their adjacent arable field margins. We suggest a single early
   mowing of berms as a valuable practice for both conservation purposes
   and weed risk control in adjacent field margins.}},

Abstract = {{AimTo assess vegetation changes in montane fens and wet meadows and
   their causes over 38years.
   LocationWetlands, Jura Mountains (Switzerland and France).
   MethodsPlots were inventoried in 1974 and re-located in 2012
   (quasi-permanent plots) on the basis of sketches to assess changes in
   plant communities. The 110 plots belonged to five phytosociological
   alliances, two in oligotrophic fens (Caricion davallianae, Caricion
   fuscae) and three in wet meadows (Calthion, Molinion, Filipendulion).
   Changes between surveys were assessed with NMDS, and changes in species
   richness, Simpson diversity, species cover and frequency and the causes
   of these changes were evaluated by comparing ecological indicator
   values.
   ResultsChanges in species composition varied between alliances, with a
   general trend towards more nutrient-rich flora with less light at ground
   level. Species diversity declined, with a marked decreasing trend for
   the typical species of each alliance. These species were partly replaced
   by species belonging to nitrophilous and mesophilous grasslands.
   However, no trend towards drier conditions was detected in these
   wetlands. The largest changes, with an important colonization by
   nitrophilous species, occurred in the Swiss sites, where grazing was
   banned 25years ago. As a result of floral shifts, many plots previously
   belonging to fens or wet mesotrophic meadows shifted to an alliance of
   the wet meadows, generally Filipendulion. Moreover, communities showed a
   slight trend towards more thermophilous flora.
   ConclusionsThe investigated wetlands in the Jura Mountains have suffered
   mainly from eutrophication due to land-use abandonment and N deposition,
   with a loss of typical species. Areas with constant land use (grazing or
   mowing) showed less marked changes in species composition. The most
   important action to conserve these wetlands is to maintain or
   reintroduce the traditional practices of extensive mowing and livestock
   grazing in the wetlands, especially in areas where they were abandoned
   25years ago. This previous land-use change was intended to improve fen
   conservation, but it was obviously the wrong measure for conservation
   purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Dung beetles are an ecologically important group of insect species
   inhabiting semi-natural grasslands in Europe. Despite their ecological
   importance, several dung beetle species are currently facing local
   threats mainly stemming from changes in land use practices, including
   the abandonment of pasturelands. The aim of this study was to analyze
   the impact of the progressive abandonment of grazing lands on dung
   beetle alpha diversity, abundance, biomass and body size classes. Areas
   representing a range of trophic resource availability were compared: (i)
   abandoned, (ii) low and (iii) moderate grazing intensity. A total of
   136,884 specimens belonging to 56 species (3 Geotrupinae; 16
   Scarabaeinae; 37 Aphodiinae) of dung beetle were collected. Pastureland
   abandonment was shown to lead to a decrease in alpha diversity and
   biomass density, a reduction of 22 and 78\% respectively in abandoned
   areas. From a biomass standpoint, the effects of pastureland abandonment
   varied according to the body size classes of the dung beetles, with
   larger species proving more susceptible to local extinction. Such
   body-size dependent variations led us to propose the use of both biomass
   and abundance data in making assessments since they are differentially
   sensitive to trophic resource availability. Hence, from a
   conservationist standpoint, the obtained results suggest that
   traditional pastureland management with low-moderate grazing intensity
   should be maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has caused drastic declines in the area and
   species richness of semi-natural grasslands across Europe. Novel
   habitats, such as power line clearings, provide alternative habitats and
   niches for grassland species, and might therefore mitigate these
   declines. However, it is not fully understood which environmental
   factors determine the occurrence of grassland species in the clearings.
   Identifying the most important drivers for grassland species occurrence
   would help understand the value of the clearings for grassland
   conservation and target enhanced management into clearings with most
   potential as grassland habitat. We studied the effects of local
   environmental conditions, and past and present connectivity to
   semi-natural grasslands, on the species richness of grassland plants and
   butterflies in 43 power line clearings in Finland. The results of
   generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning showed that
   increasing time since clear-cut and amount of clearing residue decreased
   the species richness of both species groups, while the cover of mesic
   habitats increased it. However, the two species groups showed also
   divergent responses. Present-day local environmental conditions appeared
   to be the sole driver of grassland butterfly species richness, whereas
   the richness of grassland plants was related both to current conditions
   and historical connectivity to grasslands in 1870-1880s. This suggests
   the presence of an extinction debt in the studied grassland plant
   communities, emphasizing the need for enhanced management to increase
   suitable grassland habitat in the clearings. This would diminish the
   potential future losses of grassland plant species in the clearings and
   create valuable habitat for grassland butterflies as well.}},

Abstract = {{Standard management of Czech hay meadows consists of machine mowing
   twice a year, with the first mowing in or before mid-June and the second
   mowing 40-60 days later. Here, we aimed to analyse the effects of the
   first year of implementation of the agri-environment scheme (AES), which
   consisted of allowing 3-10\% of permanent grasslands within each land
   block to remain unmown until at least August 15, on the abundance and
   diversity of spiders. We conducted the study at 40 paired sampling sites
   in three meadow types in northern Czechia. Spiders were sampled using
   pitfall traps and sweeping, and the plant cover and vascular plant
   species composition were analysed. Nearly all study sites were
   associated with 100\% vegetation cover, and hosted 209 vascular plant
   species, of which 12 were threatened. The number of vascular plant
   species exhibited only modest differences between the study sites under
   standard and AES-prescribed management. We captured a total of 3889
   individuals of 103 spider species. The abundance of spiders was
   three-times higher at sites subjected to AES management. The number of
   species was similar irrespective of the management applied, but the
   species composition differed in response to the management (Sorensen
   index 0.562-0.736). The AES management was associated with higher
   abundance of common vegetation-dwelling farmland spiders, but epigeic
   spiders decreased there or were insensitive to AES management. It
   remains to be investigated whether threatened vegetation-dwelling
   spiders may benefit from similar AESs at sites of their occurrence, such
   as in fen meadows or steppes.}},

Title = {{Hen harrier Circus cyaneus nest sites on the Isle of Mull are associated
   with habitat mosaics and constrained by topography}},
Journal = {{BIRD STUDY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{62-71}},
Abstract = {{Capsule: Hen Harriers Circus cyaneus on the Isle of Mull, UK, are
   associated with habitat mosaics consisting of moorland, scrub and
   forestry but avoid grazed land, suggesting that forested habitats could
   be managed sympathetically for the Hen Harrier in the future should the
   current UK population increase.
   Aims: To use distribution modelling to investigate nesting habitat
   associations using a long-term data set for the Hen Harrier on Mull.
   Methods: We develop area-interaction models using a least absolute
   shrinkage and selection operator penalty to explore the distribution of
   102 Hen Harrier nest sites in relation to habitat and topography. Our
   model is then successfully validated in tests using data for 70 nest
   sites from subsequent years.
   Results: Our model is effective in predicting suitable areas for Hen
   Harrier nest sites and indicates that Hen Harriers on Mull are found in
   habitat mosaics below 200 m above sea level. Hen Harrier nest intensity
   is positively associated with increasing proportions of moorland and
   scrub, open canopy forestry and closed canopy forestry. Nest intensity
   is negatively associated with increasing proportions of grazed land.
   Conclusion: Hen Harriers avoid grazed areas but are relatively tolerant
   of other habitat combinations. These findings are supported by previous
   observations of Hen Harrier habitat use and have implications for the
   recovery of some Hen Harrier populations in Special Protection Areas and
   future forest management. Open canopy forest and forest mosaics could
   potentially be incorporated into landscape-scale conservation plans for
   Hen Harriers using the population on Mull as an example.}},

Abstract = {{The cork oak woods of the Chrea Biosphere Reserve in northern Algeria
   are showing the effects of human activities that have profoundly
   modified the plant landscape. Recurrent wildfires and overgrazing are
   the main causes of disruption to the existing woodland formations,
   causing losses of both wooded areas and plant biodiversity. Our aim was
   to identify how the vegetation in the Quercus suber L. ecosystem in this
   reserve is reacting to the environmental conditions and disruption
   arising from human activity. To do so, we used a synchronous approach
   involving 124 phytoecological surveys conducted at different dynamic
   stages and taking into account the presence or absence of disturbance
   due to grazing. An initial canonical correlation analysis of the
   floristic data was performed, followed by a second on the vital
   attributes of each species, using easily measurable variables
   (biological type, Grime's adaptive strategy, mode of dissemination). Our
   results show that plant life in these cork oak woods is organised along
   a gradient of degradation associated with human action (wildfires and
   grazing), which masks the effects of the dominant mesological factors
   (altitude and exposure). The functional approach confirms these
   regressive dynamics by individualising two functional groups: the first
   covers the ``phanerophyte, competition-stress, zoochory{''}
   characteristics of the most mature plant formations, while the second
   encompasses the ``therophyte, stress-ruderal, anemochory{''}
   characteristics associated with the open formations of overgrazed
   grasslands. This study, conducted via a functional approach to
   biodiversity, provides an initial assessment of the responses of
   Algeria's cork oak woods to disturbances of human origin, in this case
   wildfires and overgrazing.}},

Pages = {{81-84}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Many ecosystems located within agricultural landscapes are in decline,
   particularly woodlands, grasslands and wetlands. Surviving remnants are
   generally fragmented and unrepresentative of pre-disturbance states.
   Here, we investigate the potential for recovery of ecosystem. function
   in a grassy woodland wetland mosaic in south-eastern Australia. We focus
   on the Plains Wood-land/Herb-rich Gilgai Wetland Mosaics which have
   declined in extent by 85\%. The gilgai soils form a distinctive
   microrelief of mounds and depressions which become seasonally
   waterlogged, providing important habitat for a large range of aquatic
   and dryland species. We surveyed 10 remnants subject to agricultural
   intensification and seven remnants subject to passive restoration (four
   with cessation of cultivation and three with livestock removal). Gilgai
   microrelief was homogenized by cultivation, showed some recovery after
   release from cultivation, and was insensitive to grazing pressure.
   Floristic diversity, assessed through indicator species, was vulnerable
   to grazing. Indicator species were more prevalent in previously grazed
   sites, but further study is required to determine whether this reflects
   recovery or differing overall management history. We conclude that
   passive restoration is possible for recovery of wetland function and
   some biodiversity values. These conservation actions should be
   encouraged given the important role these microwetlands play in
   landscape connectivity and as drought refugia.}},

Abstract = {{Many biodiversity experiments have demonstrated that plant diversity can
   stabilize productivity in experimental grasslands. However, less is
   known about how diversity-stability relationships are mediated by
   grazing. Grazing is known for causing species losses, but its effects on
   plant functional groups (PFGs) composition and species asynchrony, which
   are closely correlated with ecosystem stability, remain unclear. We
   conducted a six-year grazing experiment in a semi-arid steppe, using
   seven levels of grazing intensity (0, 1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0, 7.5, and 9.0
   sheep per hectare) and two grazing systems (i.e., a traditional,
   continuous grazing system during the growing period (TGS), and a mixed
   one rotating grazing and mowing annually (MGS)), to examine the effects
   of grazing system and grazing intensity on the abundance and composition
   of PFGs and diversity-stability relationships. Ecosystem stability was
   similar between mixed and continuous grazing treatments. However, within
   the two grazing systems, stability was maintained through different
   pathways, that is, along with grazing intensity, persistence biomass
   variations in MGS, and compensatory interactions of PFGs in their
   biomass variations in TGS. Ecosystem temporal stability was not
   decreased by species loss but rather remain unchanged by the strong
   compensatory effects between PFGs, or a higher grazing-induced decrease
   in species asynchrony at higher diversity, and a higher grazing-induced
   increase in the temporal variation of productivity in diverse
   communities. Ecosystem stability of aboveground net primary production
   was not related to species richness in both grazing systems. High
   grazing intensity weakened the temporal stabilizing effects of diversity
   in this semi-arid grassland. Our results demonstrate that the
   productivity of dominant PFGs is more important than species richness
   for maximizing stability in this system. This study distinguishes
   grazing intensity and grazing system from diversity effects on the
   temporal stability, highlighting the need to better understand how
   grazing regulates ecosystem stability, plant diversity, and their
   synergic relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Plant functional traits reflect individual and community ecological
   strategies. They allow the detection of directional changes in community
   dynamics and ecosystemic processes, being an additional tool to assess
   biodiversity than species richness. Analysis of functional patterns in
   plant communities provides mechanistic insight into biodiversity
   alterations due to anthropogenic activity. Although studies have
   considered of either anthropogenic management or nutrient availability
   on functional traits in temperate grasslands, studies combining effects
   of both drivers are scarce. Here, we assessed the impacts of management
   intensity (fertilization, mowing, grazing), nutrient stoichiometry (C,
   N, P, K), and vegetation composition on community-weighted means (CWMs)
   and functional diversity (Rao's Q) from seven plant traits in 150
   grasslands in three regions in Germany, using data of 6 years. Land use
   and nutrient stoichiometry accounted for larger proportions of model
   variance of CWM and Rao's Q than species richness and productivity.
   Grazing affected all analyzed trait groups; fertilization and mowing
   only impacted generative traits. Grazing was clearly associated with
   nutrient retention strategies, that is, investing in durable structures
   and production of fewer, less variable seed. Phenological variability
   was increased. Fertilization and mowing decreased seed number/mass
   variability, indicating competition-related effects. Impacts of nutrient
   stoichiometry on trait syndromes varied. Nutrient limitation (large N:P,
   C:N ratios) promoted species with conservative strategies, that is,
   investment in durable plant structures rather than fast growth, fewer
   seed, and delayed flowering onset. In contrast to seed mass,
   leaf-economics variability was reduced under P shortage. Species
   diversity was positively associated with the variability of generative
   traits. Synthesis. Here, land use, nutrient availability, species
   richness, and plant functional strategies have been shown to interact
   complexly, driving community composition, and vegetation responses to
   management intensity. We suggest that deeper understanding of underlying
   mechanisms shaping community assembly and biodiversity will require
   analyzing all these parameters.}},

   global meta-analysis}},

Abstract = {{Scattered trees are thought to be keystone structures for biodiversity
   in landscapes world-wide. However, such trees have been largely
   neglected by researchers and their importance for biodiversity remains
   unclear.
   We completed a global meta-analysis to quantify relationships between
   scattered trees and the species richness, abundance and composition of
   vertebrates, arthropods and plants. First, we tested whether areas near
   scattered trees support higher levels of species richness and abundance
   than nearby open areas. Second, we compared levels of species richness
   and abundance in matrix areas with scattered trees and areas embedded
   within nearby habitat patches. We also compared the composition of
   biological communities inhabiting habitat patches, open areas and areas
   with scattered trees.
   A total of 62 studies contained suitable data for our quantitative
   analyses. The local abundance of arthropods, vertebrates and woody
   plants was 60\%-430\% greater and overall species richness was
   50\%-100\% higher in areas with scattered trees than in open areas.
   Conversely, for herbaceous plants, there was no consistent relationship
   between species abundance and the occurrence of scattered trees,
   although species richness was, on average, 43\% lower.
   The abundance and richness of all taxonomic groups was similar in matrix
   areas supporting scattered trees and habitat patches, although the
   species richness of epiphytes was, on average, 50\% higher in habitat
   patches. Communities inhabiting habitat patches were more similar in
   composition to the communities inhabiting areas with scattered trees,
   and less similar to the communities of open areas.
   Synthesis and applications. Areas with scattered trees support greater
   levels of biodiversity than open areas, as well as communities that are
   more similar to those inhabiting habitat patches. Scattered trees can be
   regarded as keystone structures for vertebrates, arthropods and
   terrestrial plants in landscapes world-wide. The maintenance of
   scattered trees may be compatible with livestock grazing in some
   agricultural landscapes. Greater management effort and targeted,
   long-term policies are needed to retain or re-establish scattered trees
   in many farming landscapes in both forest and non-forest biomes around
   the world.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BRYOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{12-30}},
Abstract = {{Factors driving the species richness and distribution of bryophytes are
   poorly studied and not well understood, particularly in grasslands. We
   analysed the occurrence of bryophyte species and variation in species
   richness across 674 plots (0.5 m x 0.5 m) in alvar vegetation (grassland
   on limestone pavement with thin or no soil) on oland (Sweden) in
   relation to substrate characteristics and chemistry, inundation
   frequency, grazing pressure and geographical variables. We found 148
   taxa, including 11 nationally red-listed ones. Species richness per plot
   was significantly associated with substrate type, positively associated
   with pH and grazing intensity, but negatively associated with soil
   depth. However, richness of species typical of, or restricted to, alvar
   habitats responded differently to richness of species more common in
   other habitats. Typical alvar species were favoured by high pH, shallow
   soil and low phosphate availability, while generalists preferred
   relatively low pH, higher phosphate availability and organic or mull
   soil types. Distance from the alvar margin had only weak effects.
   Concerning the effects on individual species and community composition,
   inundation frequency and pH were found to have the largest effects,
   although other factors (substrate type, soil depth, bare soil, bare
   stone, phosphate availability and grazing pressure) were more important
   for some individual species, stressing the importance of microsite
   variability and variability in management for regional species richness.
   From a conservation perspective, it is concluded that grazing is
   generally positive whilst factors increasing phosphate availability may
   disadvantage the typical alvar species, and proximity to the alvar
   margin is not a major problem.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{101-112}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Reductions in community evenness can lead to local extinctions as
   dominant species exclude subordinate species; however, herbivores can
   prevent competitive exclusion by consuming otherwise dominant plant
   species, thus increasing evenness. While these predictions logically
   result from chronic, gradual reductions in evenness, rapid, temporary
   pulses of dominance may also reduce species richness. Short pulses of
   dominance can occur as biotic or abiotic conditions temporarily favour
   one or a few species, manifested as increased temporal variability (the
   inverse of temporal stability) in community evenness. Here, we tested
   whether consumers help maintain plant diversity by reducing the temporal
   variability in community evenness. We tested our hypothesis by reducing
   herbivore abundance in a detailed study of a developing, tallgrass
   prairie restoration. To assess the broader implications of the
   importance of herbivory on community evenness as well as potential
   mechanisms, we paired this study with a global herbivore reduction
   experiment. We found that herbivores maintained plant richness in a
   tallgrass prairie restoration by limiting temporary pulses in dominance
   by a single species. Dominance by an annual species in a single year was
   negatively associated with species richness, suggesting that short
   pulses of dominance may be sufficient to exclude subordinate species.
   The generality of this site-level relationship was supported by the
   global experiment in which inter-annual variability in evenness declined
   in the presence of vertebrate herbivores over timeframes ranging in
   length from 2 to 5years, preventing declines in species richness.
   Furthermore, inter-annual variability of community evenness was also
   negatively associated with pre-treatment species richness.Synthesis. A
   loss or reduction of herbivores can destabilize plant communities by
   allowing brief periods of dominance by one or a few species, potentially
   triggering a feedback cycle of dominance and extinction. Such cycles may
   not occur immediately following the loss of herbivores, being delayed
   until conditions allow temporary periods of dominance by a subset of
   plant species.}},

   We applied structural equation models (SEMs) using data from 735
   quadrats across 35 study sites in semi-steppe rangelands in Iran. The
   combination of plant coverage and species richness rather than Shannon's
   diversity or species diversity (a latent variable of species richness
   and evenness) substantially enhance aboveground biomass across plant
   growth forms. In all selected SEMs, plant coverage had a strong positive
   direct effect on aboveground biomass (beta = 0.72 for shrubs, 0.84 for
   forbs and 0.80 for grasses), followed by a positive effect of species
   richness beta = 0.26 for shrubs, 0.05 for forbs and 0.09 for grasses),
   and topographic factors. Disturbance intensity had a negative effect on
   plant coverage, whereas it had a variable effect on species richness
   across plant growth forms. Plant coverage had a strong positive total
   effect on aboveground biomass (beta = 0.84 for shrubs, 0.88 for forbs,
   and 0.85 for grasses), followed by a positive effect of species
   richness, and a negative effect of disturbance intensity across plant
   growth forms. Our results shed light on the management of rangelands
   that is high plant coverage can significantly improve species richness
   and aboveground biomass across plant growth forms. We also found that
   high disturbance intensity due to heavy grazing has a strong negative
   effect on plant coverage rather than species richness in semi -steppe
   rangelands. This study suggests, that proper grazing systems (e.g.
   rotational system) based on carrying capacity and stocking rate of a
   rangeland may be helpful for biodiversity conservation, better grazing
   of livestock, improvement of plant coverage and enhancement of
   aboveground biomass. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deforestation principally to establish cattle pastures has created large
   expanses of land dominated by exotic grass prior to the establishment of
   the Cerro Blanco Protected Forest in Ecuador. A dry forest restoration
   program was carried out from 2008 to 2017. Tree planting sites were
   cleared in parallel lines through abandoned pasture and secondary
   vegetation using manual labor. Native tree species were produced in a
   nursery on site and used in yearly plantings during the rainy season. A
   total of 637 hectares were planted at an average stocking density of
   1,000 trees per hectare. Growth data was collected from trees planted in
   nine sites from 2008 to 2017. Mortality rates were determined from a
   sample of 400 trees of twenty-two species. Survival of all species was
   greater than 50\%. Ten species had survival rates greater than 90\%.
   Vitex gigantea, with high survival rates, also had significantly greater
   growth rates than the other species (p < 0.0001) and showed the greatest
   yearly accumulation of total carbon (2.07 Kg C yr(-1) stem(-1)). Other
   species with high growth rates were Cordia alliodora and Centrolobium
   ochroxylum. This restoration program demonstrates that the dry forest
   restoration with timely maintenance and protection from fire and grazing
   is possible with intensive tree planting of native species.}},

Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{222-228}},
Abstract = {{Fire is a major threat to remnant native woody vegetation in dry,
   lowland New Zealand. This is because the woody flora lacks specific
   adaptations to survive fire, and seedling regeneration is constrained by
   summer drought, limited native seed rain and intense competition from
   non-native grasses that are often favoured by fire. In December 2000, a
   fire burnt a 41 ha remnant of mature Kunzea robusta (Myrtaceae) forest
   in the Wither Hills, Marlborough, a dry region with little remaining
   native woody vegetation. Shortly after the fire the area was fenced to
   exclude grazing animals and oversown with pasture species to stabilise
   the soil. A study was then initiated in June 2001 to determine the rate
   and direction of native forest recovery using 15 randomly located
   monitoring plots. Plots were re-measured in summer 2001, 2002, 2003 and
   2015. Additional strategically located plots monitored the survival and
   re-growth of burnt individuals of Kunzea robusta, Sophora prostrata
   (Fabaceae) and Clematis quadribracteolata (Ranunculaceae). In spite of
   the dry climate, limited seed rain, oversowing and absence of grazing,
   woody biomass has started to recover after fire in the Wither Hills but
   slowly as non-native grasses are overwhelmingly dominant. After 15
   years, woody biomass and cover are less than 5\% of the original
   estimate for the area. However, while fire-damaged Kunzea mostly died,
   Sophora and Clematis individuals have recovered through resprouting. Our
   study site is typical of many dryland areas in New Zealand in which
   native biodiversity is part of a productive landscape and is under
   threat from fire, weeds and grazing. It is inevitable that a proportion
   of dryland reserves will be burnt each decade and our results underscore
   the need for conservation planning to incorporate fire and for
   experimental investigations to assist with accelerating native
   vegetation recovery.}},

Pages = {{271-285}},
Abstract = {{A long-term (1993-2016) fire experiment in the grazed semi-arid savanna
   of the Northern Territory was used to investigate the relative impacts
   of soil properties and fire history on vegetation composition and
   diversity in grassland and woodland habitats. Subtle variation in soil
   texture influenced vegetation composition and abundance independently of
   fire variables and was generally a more important control on floristic
   patterns. Total species richness, lifeform richness and the abundance
   and presence of many individual plant species declined with increasing
   clay content. Linear mixed effect models with combined habitat data,
   showed total richness and richness of annual and perennial forbs, annual
   grasses and legumes increased with more frequent fire. Perennial grass
   abundance and richness was not influenced by fire. Total and lifeform
   mean richness did not vary between two and four yearly or early and late
   burnt treatments. Richness and abundance was generally significantly
   higher on burnt blocks than unburnt blocks regardless of fire season or
   interval. These results suggest greater diversity after burning is a
   result of an increase in ephemeral species. However, the overall
   influence of fire on floristic patterns is relatively moderate and fire
   regimes may therefore be manipulated for other management imperatives,
   such as fauna conservation, carbon sequestration and pastoral
   productivity without substantial impacts on botanical values in
   semi-arid tropical savannas.}},

Title = {{Grazing and tree `clearing' alter grass-associated invertebrate
   assemblages in an Australian tropical grassy woodland}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{539-554}},
Abstract = {{To evaluate the response of invertebrates to `clearing' and grazing
   pressure impacts, a previously grazed but uncleared grassy woodland in
   central Queensland was manipulated to provide four grazing pressures
   (destocked, low, moderate and high) and two tree treatments (with trees,
   i.e. untreated, and `cleared', i.e. trees and saplings poisoned with
   herbicides), with two replicates of each, making 16 plots in total.
   Monitoring was carried out in 1998, approximately four years
   post-establishment of the treatments. Two types of samples were taken:
   pitfall for ground-active fauna and suction for grass-associated fauna.
   Overall, 23 orders of invertebrates were sampled by pitfalls and 22 by
   suction. Significant effects of grazing on invertebrate assemblages were
   detected by both methods, but no effects were detected from `clearing'.
   There was a gradation in the invertebrate assemblages from low to high
   grazing pressure, the invertebrate assemblages in the paddocks with the
   highest grazing differing most from those in the destocked and
   low-grazing-pressure paddocks. Notwithstanding the lack of effect of
   `clearing' at the assemblage level, ground-active invertebrates and some
   grass-associated invertebrates increased in abundance following
   `clearing', possibly reflecting an increase in the quality of the
   resource base. However, ground-active invertebrates and grass-associated
   invertebrates showed contrasting responses to grazing pressure, the
   former increasing, possibly reflecting changes in trapability due to the
   more open vegetation structure at higher grazing pressures. The
   abundance of grass-associated invertebrates declined by 50-80\% with
   increased grazing - although with complex changes in assemblage
   structure. Despite those declines, the basic trophic pyramid remained,
   and, along with that, the potential for recovery of invertebrate
   assemblages and associated ecosystem services with reduction in grazing
   intensity. With 80\% of Queensland grazed, the reduction in invertebrate
   abundance has implications for the viability of insectivores,
   particularly mobile fauna such as birds, at a landscape scale. It is
   recommended that the utility of using suction samples as a basis for
   assessing ecosystem functional health be investigated and that grazing
   pressure be reduced to increase invertebrate assemblages of rangeland
   pastures and to improve sustainability.}},

Title = {{The effect of grazing exclusion over time on structure, biodiversity,

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},

Volume = {{610}},

Abstract = {{Climate change and increasing socio-economic pressure is placing many
   ecosystems of high ecological and economic value at risk. This is
   particularly urgent in dryland ecosystems, such as the montado, a
   multifunctional savannah-like system heavily modeled by grazing. There
   is still an ongoing debate about the trade-offs between livestock
   grazing and the potential for ecosystem regeneration. While it is
   consensual that overgrazing hinders the development of the shrubs and
   trees in this system, the effects of undergrazing or grazing exclusion
   are unclear. This study provides the unique opportunity to study the
   impact of grazing on compositional and structural biodiversity by
   examining the ecological chronosequence in a long-term ecological
   research site, located in Portugal, where grazing exclusion was
   controlled for over 15 years. As the threat of intensification persists,
   even in areas where climate shifts are evident, there is a critical need
   to understand if and how the montado might recover by removing grazing
   pressure. We evaluate succession on structural and compositional
   diversity after grazing pressure is removed from the landscape at 5, 10,
   and 15 years post-cattle exclusion and contrast it with currently grazed
   plots. A LiDAR-derived structural diversity index (LHDI), a surrogate of
   ecosystem structure and function first developed for the pine-grassland
   woodland systems, is used to quantify the impact of grazing exclusion on
   structure and natural regeneration. The distribution of the vegetation,
   particularly those of the herbaceous and shrub strata (>10 <= 150 cm),
   presents statistically significant changes. The LHDI closely mimics the
   compositional biodiversity of the shrubs, with an increase in diversity
   with increased years without grazing. Under present climate conditions,
   both shrub regeneration and the establishment of tree saplings were
   strongly promoted by grazing exclusion, which has important management
   implications for the long-term sustainability of montado systems. (C)

Title = {{Goat paddock grazing improves the conservation status of
   shrub-encroached dry grasslands}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Number = {{38}},
Pages = {{215-233}},
Abstract = {{European dry grasslands are predominantly semi-natural communities.
   Commonly, they have been used as pastures for sheep and goats. Due to
   their richness in biological diversity and the large number of
   threatened species, they are recognized as being of high conservation
   value. However, in the last few decades, a dramatic decline in dry
   grassland areas has been observed throughout Europe. Pasture abandonment
   followed by grass and shrub encroachment are the main causes of dry
   grassland loss, especially at isolated marginal sites. The introduction
   of goat paddock grazing can be an efficient method for restoring
   shrub-encroached dry grasslands, but most recommendations are still
   based on anecdotal evidence. Hence, this study investigated the impact
   of goat paddock grazing with a relatively high grazing pressure (0.6 to
   0.8 LU/ha/yr) over seven years on habitat structure and species richness
   in six encroached dry grassland localities of the lower Saale River
   valley in Central Germany. In each paddock, we analyzed 25-m(2) plots in
   highly (initial woody species cover of >= 25\%) and less encroached
   areas (initial woody species cover < 25\%) and compared the development
   of woody species, grass encroachment indicators, litter cover and the
   share of bare soil as well as the coverage and number of target and
   ruderal species with that of ungrazed control plots.
   We observed the following effects of restorative goat paddock grazing:
   Woody plants and litter layer cover declined significantly in all
   paddock plots. In addition, the share of bare soil increased
   significantly in the less encroached paddock plots. The number of target
   species increased significantly in the formerly highly encroached plots,
   whereas the already high target species richness slightly increased on
   originally less encroached plots. Besides short-lived target species,
   even red list species were able to colonize the grazed plots.
   Furthermore, we observed a slightly increasing number of ruderal
   species, but at a very low level of coverage. An opposite trend was
   recorded in the ungrazed plots: The cover of woody and competitive grass
   species, as well as litter coverage, increased significantly over time.
   While the cover of target species decreased significantly in the highly
   encroached plots, the number of target species stayed stable in both
   types of control plots, showing the restoration potential of the
   encroached grasslands.
   Based on our findings, we conclude that goat paddock grazing with a
   relatively high grazing pressure can be an effective tool to restore
   encroached dry grasslands. The reduction of encroachment and the
   increasing number of target species correlates with the improved
   conservation status of these highly valuable dry grassland habitat
   types. Finally, recommendations for the implementation of restorative
   goat grazing are given.}},

Title = {{Restoration possibilities of dry grasslands afforested by pine: the role
   of seed bank and remnant vegetation}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Number = {{38}},
Pages = {{405-418}},
Abstract = {{Stipa-dominated steppe-like dry grasslands represent a great nature
   conservation priority in Romania and in the whole European Union. In
   Romania, due to their low productivity, many sites had been afforested
   by pines or black locust trees at the end of the 1950's in order to
   raise economic value and to hinder landslides on the steep slopes.
   Economic expectations did not live up, thus afforested sites will
   increasingly be targeted for grassland restoration, especially in
   protected areas of the Natura 2000 network. We analysed seed bank and
   aboveground vegetation in a 40-year-old black pine plantation site
   established on a former dry grassland near Viisoara (Transylvanian
   Lowland), and compared to that of an adjacent intact dry grassland
   stand. In both stands, eight 5 m x 5 m plots for soil and vegetation
   analysis were established. Inside each plot, six cylinder-shaped soil
   cores of 4 cm diameter and 10 cm depths were drilled; soil samples from
   the same plot were subsequently mixed up. Soil sampling was carried out
   in early spring, 2008. We analysed seed densities and composition in
   soil samples using the seedling emergence method. In addition, we
   recorded percentage cover of plant species in the plots in June. We
   wanted to find out on what extent we can rely on the soil seed bank and
   remnant vegetation, if active interventions are planned to restore a
   grassland stand in the place of a pine plantation. In total, 293
   seedlings belonging to 51 species have emerged from soil samples. Seed
   density in the soil seed bank of the pine plantation was substantially
   higher (3500 +/- 2059 seeds m(-2), 0-10 cm) than that of the intact
   grassland (1360 +/- 469 seeds m(-2), 0-10 cm). Our results showed that
   the seed bank of the plantation site, although not specifically species
   rich, may still contain a considerable amount of target species. In
   addition, we found strong populations of grassland species in the
   understory of the plantation as remnants of the former vegetation,
   which, together with seeds in the seed bank can ensure a good starting
   point to a successful natural regeneration after tree removal. Due to
   the presence of ruderal species in the seed bank and shrubs in the
   aboveground vegetation, light restoration measures comprising weed and
   shrub control are necessary following the complete removal of trees. We
   propose the reintroduction of grazing in order to ensure the spontaneous
   regeneration by propagule transport to restoration sites.}},

Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},

Pages = {{577-582}},
Abstract = {{Ranchers are increasingly expected to manage grasslands for forage
   production and native biodiversity enhancement goals. However,
   longstanding relationships between grazing and plant species are often
   understudied because elucidating effects of grazing absence and presence
   often requires experimental opportunities that are difficult to
   establish, such as the introduction of grazing to long-term ungrazed
   pastures. Addressing this knowledge gap is critical for heterogeneous
   landscapes where site-specific properties might interact with grazing
   effects to ultimately structure plant communities. We conducted
   vegetation surveys for 3 years after grazing was reintroduced to an
   annual California grassland that was not grazed for more than 60 years.
   We investigated how grazing affected plant communities in terms of cover
   and richness of native and invasive species and how topographic sites of
   summit, backslope and toeslope altered these relationships. The plant
   communities were affected by the independent effects of grazing, site
   and year. Across years, native cover was 39\% greater in grazed plots
   compared with ungrazed plots. Native species richness was slightly lower
   in ungrazed compared with grazed plots for toeslope sites relative to
   the other topographic positions. Invasive species cover was 17\% lower
   in grazed plots compared with ungrazed plots and no predictors were
   found to contribute to significant differences across plots. Although we
   generally did not find expected relationships between site and plant
   response to grazing, this work demonstrates how managers can use
   livestock to quickly modify plant communities in areas with a long
   history of grazing absence.}},

Title = {{Steppe rodents at the edge of their range: A case study of Spalax

Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{188-200}},
Abstract = {{Based on results obtained during 2000-2018 by field research, polls of
   colleagues, and OSINT analysis, features of distribution of the greater
   mole rat Spalax microphthalmus in the eastern forest steppe of Ukraine
   were considered. The studied part of the species' range is unique and
   represents the northern range edge of the entire Spalacidae family and
   of European steppe faunal assemblages in general. hi total, data on 146
   record localities were amassed, including 13 localities in the
   fragmented and 133 in the continuous part of the range. The offshoots of
   the Central Russian Upland in the valley of the Psel river (east of Sumy
   Oblast) are the sites with the highest density of settlements, while the
   species' type biotopes are steppe balka slopes. The abundance of the
   greater mole rat decreased from the east to the west, and its colonies
   are the most fragmented along the Dnipro River. The species occurs in
   steppe and meadow habitats of an area of at least 20-50 ha. Analysis of
   the current and former distribution of the greater mole rat revealed
   that the species range contracts from the west; earlier it was a common
   species in different regions of the Middle Dnipro Area (including Kyiv
   city), but the current range edge mns along the line connecting Buryn -
   Nedryhailiv - Lokhvytsia - Myrhorod - Hadiach - Zinkiv - Zaliznychne.
   Isolated settlements exist in adjacent territories, particularly in
   Ichnia Raion of Chemihiv Oblast, and Lubny, Khorol, and Kobeliaky Raions
   of Poltava Oblast. The study showed that the species' range contracted
   by two times to 35,000 km(2) for the last 100 years, which includes only
   430,000 ha of suitable habitats (15\% of the range), allowing the
   existence here of 86,000-215,000 individuals. hi fact, the species
   remained only in habitats that have been minimally affected by amble
   farming and other forms of active agricultural use. Besides, the species
   shows a clear confinement to habitats located near human settlements
   such as untilled lands, pastures with moderate grazing, waste and
   neglected lands, which constitute a separate group of transformed and
   semi-natural habitats. Formally, this allows the greater mole rat to be
   considered as a synanthropic species, because its inhabited biotopes,
   beside the zone of offshoots of the Central Russian Upland, have
   remained only near villages and along roads. The species also has an
   important biocoenotic role due to its burrowing activity and as prey of
   predatory birds (e.g., of the long-legged buzzard and Eurasian eagle
   owl) and mammals. The feeding period of the offspring of these predators
   generally coincides with the aboveground activity of mole rats, which
   lasts during May-July with a peak in June. Aboveground activity is
   mainly related to the resettlement of mole rats to new sites and
   dispersal of the young, due to which they became victims of predators.}},

Title = {{Low-intensity management promotes bryophyte diversity in grasslands}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Number = {{38}},
Pages = {{311-328}},
Abstract = {{Bryophytes constitute an important and permanent component of the
   grassland flora and diversity in Europe. As most bryophyte species are
   sensitive to habitat change, their diversity is likely to decline
   following land-use intensification. Most previous studies on bryophyte
   diversity focused on specific habitats of high bryophyte diversity, such
   as bogs, montane grasslands, or calcareous dry grasslands. In contrast,
   mesic grasslands are rarely studied, although they are the most common
   grassland habitat in Europe. They are secondary vegetation, maintained
   by agricultural use and thus, are influenced by different forms of land
   use. We studied bryophyte species richness in three regions in Germany,
   in 707 plots of 16 m(2) representing different land-use types and
   environmental conditions. Our study is one of the few to inspect the
   relationships between bryophyte richness and land use across contrasting
   regions and using a high number of replicates.
   Among the managed grasslands, pastures harboured 2.5 times more
   bryophyte species than meadows and mown pastures. Similarly, bryophyte
   cover was about twice as high in fallows and pastures than in meadows
   and mown pastures. Among the pastures, bryophyte species richness was
   about three times higher in sheep grazed plots than in the ones grazed
   by cattle or horses. In general, bryophyte species richness and cover
   was more than 50\% lower in fertilized than in unfertilized plots.
   Moreover, the amount of suitable substrates was linked to bryophyte
   diversity. Species richness of bryophytes growing on stones increased
   with stone cover, and the one of bryophytes growing on bark and deadwood
   increased with larger values of woody plant species and deadwood cover.
   Our findings highlight the importance of low-intensity land use and high
   structural heterogeneity for bryophyte conservation. They also caution
   against an intensification of traditionally managed pastures. In the
   light of our results, we recommend to maintain low-intensity sheep
   grazing on sites with low productivity, such as slopes on shallow soils.}},

   Sternbergia colchiciflora (Amaryllidaceae) in Pannonian cemeteries}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2018}},

Pages = {{371-384}},
Abstract = {{Despite huge habitat losses caused by agricultural intensification, dry
   grasslands still represent one of the most diverse ecosystems in Europe.
   Their highly fragmented remnants are often preserved in man-made or
   human-influenced habitats (e.g., kurgans, roadside verges or
   cemeteries). In recent decades the significance of cemeteries as
   suitable habitats for preserving native and rare species has been
   repeatedly emphasized. However, the effect of modern management
   practices on long-term persistence of grassland species has remained
   largely unexplored. Sternbergia colchiciflora Waldst. \& Kit. is one of
   the very few threatened dry grassland specialists whose occurrence in
   the cemeteries of the Pannonian Basin has been known for more than a
   century. This hysteranthous, myrmecochorous geophyte is considered rare
   or sporadic within its whole distribution range. In a systematic
   botanical survey we investigated 154 cemeteries in the Pannonian part of
   its distribution area. Despite modern management of cemeteries,
   characterised by frequent and intensive motorised lawn mowing, we found
   populations of S. colchiciflora at 27 Hungarian localities and confirmed
   three formerly known occurrences in Serbia. To study the effect of
   regular mowing on the long-term survival prospects of S. colchiciflora
   populations, we quantified the species' seed production (capsular seed
   number) in 9 mown and 15 unmown sites (290 and 235 specimens,
   respectively). The difference in seed number between the two groups was
   statistically insignificant (13.6 +/- 5.6 and 14.7 +/- 5.0,
   respectively). This result is probably due to the peculiar phenology and
   small stature of this species. Firstly, its annual life cycle above
   ground (from September to May) is out of the main mowing season.
   Secondly, its 3-7 cm tall flowers and fruits have a high chance of
   surviving the damaging effect of motorised mowing. Thirdly, it seems
   likely that the loss of leaf tips, i.e. a part of the assimilation
   surface, of this short-leaved (5-13 cm) species by mowing doesn't affect
   the general condition of the damaged individuals. Our study emphasizes
   the role of Central European cemeteries (even if mown intensively) in
   preservation of characteristic dry grassland plant species.}},

Title = {{Ecosystem condition assessment of semi-natural grasslands outside the
   Natura 2000 network in Bulgaria, using vegetation data}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},

Abstract = {{Action 5 of the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2020 calls EU Member States to
   map and assess ecosystem conditions and services. In line with the
   Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) and the Reports of the Working
   Group on Mapping and Assessment on Ecosystems and their Services (MAES),
   Bulgaria developed a National Methodological Framework and Methodology
   for grassland assessment and mapping. We used this methodology to
   broadly assess the ecosystem condition of semi-natural grass-lands that
   are located outside the Natura 2000 network in Bulgaria. Given the
   important role of vegetation in natural ecosystems, we focused on five
   indicators of ecosystem structure and processes: plant species richness,
   vegetation cover, number of red list plant species and invasive alien
   plants and plant biomass. The assessment of these indicators was applied
   to polygons that represent distinct grassland ecosystems. Polygons were
   mapped using aerophoto images with a minimum mapping unit of 0.25 ha.
   Whenever possible, we matched polygons to vegetation data, extracted
   from phytosociological databases. Additional field sampling was
   conducted in 2016. We filled data gaps for polygons through geospatial
   and statistical modelling. A total of 123,152 grassland polygons (sum of
   area: 634,518.23 ha), representing dry, mesic, wet and seasonally wet,
   alpine and subalpine grasslands and inland salt steppes were mapped and
   assessed. Our results show that 32\% of the grassland polygons outside
   Natura 2000 were in `very good' condition regarding `plant species
   richness', with another 49\% being in `good' condition. Polygons with
   `bad' and `very bad' scores were located in close proximity to large
   agricultural systems and heavily populated areas. Alpine and subalpine
   grasslands and inland salt steppes were usually in `good' and `very
   good' condition mostly due to a low degree of agricultural use. Wet and
   seasonally wet grasslands might be the most fragile of the assessed
   grassland ecosystems; 10\% of their polygons were found to be in `bad'
   condition regarding `plant species richness'. Biomass analysis revealed
   that more than 75\% of the assessed polygons were in `good' and `very
   good' condition, which indicates high fodder value for grazing animals.
   We conclude that grasslands outside the Natura 2000 network represent
   good examples of semi-natural ecosystems. These areas are still in
   relatively `good' condition and have the capacity to provide valuable
   ecosystem services. Our results could serve as a solid foundation for
   regional planning and policy development.}},

Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{473-483}},
Abstract = {{Herbicides are used in savanna to control tree and shrub density,
   primarily to maintain the value of the country for pastoral enterprises.
   However, the concomitant effects on biodiversity and landscape
   functioning need to be recognised and better understood. This study
   monitored tree and shrub dynamics and eventual landscape functionality
   in response to tree-killing over 7-8 years at two open eucalypt woodland
   sites in central Queensland. Paddocks denuded of trees using herbicide
   or not so treated were subject to three differing grazing pressures by
   cattle. Similarly treated but ungrazed sets of plots were subjected to
   either regular spring burns or were rarely burnt.
   Tree and shrub growth and seedling recruitment were slightly affected by
   grazing pressure but regular spring burns minimised recruitment of minor
   woodland species and reduced the population of original saplings and
   seedlings that survived the herbicide. Few eucalypt seedlings emerged
   from soil surface samples taken each spring in any treatment, despite
   the presence of flowering trees in half the treatments. Capture and
   retention of resources, particularly rainfall and nutrients, were
   slightly improved by killing the trees, and worsened by grazing. We
   conclude that killing trees with herbicide at these sites did not
   adversely affect landscape function and that woody species regeneration
   was almost inevitable on these open eucalypt woodland native pastures.}},

Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{501-511}},
Abstract = {{High altitude grazing is widespread around the globe and also has a long
   tradition in European mountain regions. One-third of the Swiss farmland
   consists of summer pastures: seasonally used marginal pastures without
   permanent settlements, which extend between the grasslands and forests
   of permanent mountain settlements and unproductive mountain tops.
   Farmers' main motivations for using those pastures have been and still
   are forage provision and health benefits for grazing animals, benefits
   for labour distribution between home farm and summer farm, and cultural
   ecosystem services such as the maintenance of a tradition and the
   associated lifestyle. Yet, remote pastures are being abandoned and are
   prone to reforestation, while more productive and accessible pastures
   are intensified. Those processes are related to changes in management
   practices, to scarcity of labour and - to a lesser extent - to climate
   change. We summarise the agronomic and ecological status of Swiss summer
   pastures, in particular with respect to livestock keeping, biodiversity
   and climate change, and speculate on future trends of summer farming.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between the diversity of different species types
   (i.e., total species, response species, effect species and common
   species), and the special function of ecosystems are not well
   understood. Our experiment was conducted on Leymus chinensis in a
   temperate steppe of northeast China from 2011 to 2013. We used a
   split-plot design with clipping treatment in the whole plot using two
   clipping frequency (clipping 1 time, clipping 2 times). Subplots were
   treated with fertilizer (urea 0, 3.26, 6.51 and 13.03 g center dot
   m(-2)center dot a(-1)). It was observed that the diversity of different
   species types affected ecosystem functioning differently. Aboveground
   net primary productivity (ANPP) was mainly affected by the diversity of
   response species and effect species. Clipping had enormous effects on
   the diversity of total species, whereas the changes in diversity of
   response species mainly correlated with resource availability. Our
   results suggest that ANPP is driven by the diversity of a few effect
   species because they have a great influence on ANPP. Moreover, the
   effects of diversity differ among different species. (C) 2018 Friends

Abstract = {{Question: Is domestic cattle an appropriate surrogate for fire in a
   protected humid temperate savanna? Study area: El Palmar Grande de Colon
   (31 degrees 52'S, 58 degrees 17'W), Argentina. Methods: We surveyed
   dense Butia yatay palm savannas in two neighboring protected areas, El
   Palmar National Park (EPNP), under cattle exclusion since 1970 with
   sporadic burning; and La Aurora Wildlife Refuge (LAWR), under moderate
   cattle density, and not burnt since 1997. In each area, we randomly
   selected ten dense savanna stands, established 500 m(2) plots and
   undertook floristic survey in spring and summer to produce exhaustive
   plant-species lists. We statistically compared the two samples in terms
   of: local and global diversities; compositional heterogeneity among
   stands; mean similarity to a historical record from the area; overall
   species composition; and abundance and numbers of species with different
   growth habits and origins. Results: Differences between our samples are
   clear-cut. Savannas at EPNP have significantly increased local and
   global species richness and exhibit decreased similarities with the
   historical record. They have a novel understory, with significantly
   increased abundances and species numbers of fire-resistant grassland
   shrubs and fire-sensitive trees, and a groundcover with significantly
   increased richness of subshrub and perennial graminoid species. Savannas
   at LAWR have virtually no woody understory, and exhibit a groundcover
   dominated by an impoverished suite of perennial grasses, with
   significantly increased abundances and numbers of annual and of exotic
   species. Conclusions: Our results suggest that large-scale, long-term
   cattle exclusion and sporadic fires have resulted in changes in the
   structure and composition of the savanna vegetation leading to increased
   plant species diversity. Apparently, conservation of these humid
   savannas in protected areas requires periodic fire, while domestic
   cattle are a poor alternative for maintaining their plant species
   diversity.}},

   the sustainability of agriculture ?}},
Journal = {{INRA PRODUCTIONS ANIMALES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{37-50}},
Abstract = {{The numbers of equine livestock in France (around 1 million heads) are
   much fewer compared to those of cattle and sheep. Saddle horses and
   ponies used for equestrian sports and leisure represent 2/3 of the
   equine population. The racing sector represents alone a turnover of 10
   billion euros. Whatever the type of production or activity (breeding,
   livery yard, training center, equestrian center...), the presence of
   equines on structures is mainly motivated by the leader's enthusiasm for
   this animal. This leads to confusions between leisure activities and
   economic productions. This also influences the time that farmers spend
   with horses and their economic objectives. This finally can generate a
   lack of understanding from the rest of the agricultural world.
   Nevertheless, this interest may also explain why equine production and
   activities are encountered all over the country, where horses contribute
   to the image and attractiveness of rural and suburban areas. Moreover,
   the specificities of horse behavior allow them to use grasslands that
   are unsuitable for cattle grazing or to use the same areas in a
   complementary way. Horses therefore contribute to the preservation of
   natural resources and biodiversity. A better knowledge of the economic,
   social and environmental impacts of equine production and activities in
   the agricultural sector should increase its readability with
   agricultural professionals and public interlocutors. This could lead to
   a better integration of the equine industry in the agriculture policies
   towards more sustainability.}},

   slurry application rates revealed, while cover of legumes, short forbs,
   and NUE decreased. In more productive sites (WS and SS), slurry
   application in the amount of 180 kg N/ha could be suggested as a slurry
   dose ensuring beneficial agronomic objectives. However, nature
   conservation requirements via maintaining plant biodiversity were not
   met. On the contrary, short-term slurry application up to 120 kg N/ha
   ensured on permeable DS not only sufficient agronomic objectives, but
   also plant biodiversity conservation requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term grazing shaped plant diversity in dry Mediterranean
   grasslands. Abandonment of grazing affects plant diversity especially in
   the northern Mediterranean. Considerable efforts are, therefore, under
   way for grassland conservation and restoration. Yet, we do not know at
   which temporal scales impacts of grazing abandonment appear and in
   particular how soil seed banks evolve after longer grazing abandonment.
   Here, we provide detailed data from one of the very few long-term
   experiments available. These experiments provide data for up to 23years
   (1982-2005) of grazing exclusion built in 1982, 1989, 2000 and 2001.
   Grazing exclusion decreased species richness, modified vegetation
   structure and changed soil parameters. Decline in species richness
   appears in communities that experienced 16 and 23years of grazing
   exclusion. Only four to nine plant species of this Mediterranean
   grassland built persistent soil seed banks appearing after grazing
   exclusion, compared to 40-50 species in the established vegetation of
   grazed plots. Hence, similarity between vegetation and soil seed bank
   decreased with time of grazing exclusion. Even 23years after
   abandonment, no woody plants colonised the experiments. We conclude that
   vegetation will recover fast from grazing abandonment in the short-term.
   Nevertheless, longer abandonment will impact diversity due to reduced
   soil seed banks.}},

Abstract = {{Plantations established on grasslands have low recruitment of
   broadleaved trees and therefore may require particular attention when
   developing biodiversity-oriented management practices. In this study, we
   tested four hypotheses concerning woody recruits in Japanese cedar
   (Cryptomeria japonica) plantations established on grasslands with
   respect to their distance from the nearest Konara oak (Quercus serrata)
   forest. Our four hypotheses were as follows: (1) both species richness
   and occurrence frequency (the number of subplots in which recruits were
   present) decline with increasing distance; (2) the strength of the
   effect of distance differs depending on the growth form, seed dispersal
   type, or life history trait; (3) the species richness of recruits does
   not increase in response to a disturbance or other site conditions; (4)
   and species composition of recruits also changes with distance. Our
   results showed that species richness and occurrence frequency generally
   declined with increasing distance. This result supports the first
   hypothesis. The effect of distance was stronger in wind-dispersed
   species than in bird-dispersed species, as predicted by the second
   hypothesis. Disturbances such as thinning or wind throw did not increase
   but rather did decrease species richness, as predicted by the third
   hypothesis. Furthermore, distance had the strongest impact on species
   composition, as predicted by the fourth hypothesis. These findings show
   that, in biodiversity-oriented management, it may be more challenging to
   increase biodiversity using stand-level management in plantations
   established on grasslands than in plantations established after
   clear-cutting of broadleaved forests. Thus, landscape-level management
   may be required for these cases.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of biodiversity stands out as a serious environmental challenge
   worldwide. Old mountain farmland is unique in this respect, as animal
   husbandry with summer grazing has created a rich ecosystem. Mountain
   farming usually takes place in relatively remote areas with scattered
   populations and marginal food production in terms of quantity.
   Outmigration and changes in agriculture result in overgrown pastures and
   thus a loss of biodiversity. To conserve biodiversity, politicians
   worldwide have put conservation of the mountain agricultural landscape
   on the agenda. The conservation policy includes traditional farming
   because nature in this cultural landscape depends on human activity.
   This article explores how policies have questionable effects on the
   landscape and shows how farmers choose various types of farming based on
   individual perspectives and goals. Several futures are conceivable, but
   under the circumstances of global environmental challenges, these are
   all fraught with uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the impacts of future climate change on the grassland
   ecosystems of Inner Mongolia is important for adaptation of natural
   resource planning, livestock industries and livelihoods. The CENTURY
   model was validated against observed climate data from 1981 to 2010 for
   16 sites. It simulated grass productivity and soil fertility with
   acceptable agreement, with the coefficient of the root-mean-square error
   calculated as 41.0\% for biomass and 19.5\% for soil organic carbon. The
   model was then used to assess changes to 2100 in aboveground biomass and
   soil organic carbon under two different climate-change scenarios that
   were developed for the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental
   Panel on Climate Change. The first scenario, RCP4.5 is an intermediate
   scenario for climate change, incorporating policies and technologies
   that stabilise growth in greenhouse-gas emissions. The second, RCP8.5,
   assumes continuing, high demand for energy and increasing greenhouse-gas
   emissions. Aboveground biomass of meadow and desert steppes responded
   positively to both scenarios, whereas the typical steppe showed a
   negative response to RCP4.5 but a positive response to RCP 8.5. Soil
   organic carbon showed a negative response for all steppe types. The
   simulations indicated that aboveground biomass and soil organic carbon
   of Inner Mongolian steppes were sensitive to projected emission
   scenarios. The CENTURY model predicted aboveground biomass to be 8.5\%
   higher in the longer term (2081-2100) than baseline (1986-2005) under
   RCP4.5, and 24.3\% higher under RCP8.5. Soil organic carbon was
   predicted to undergo small but significant decreases on average across
   all sites (1.2\% for RCP4.5. 2.9\% for RCP8.5). Our results could help
   decision makers to appreciate the consequences of climate change and
   plan adaptation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In Argentina, predominantly in the Pampas ecoregion, the natural
   rangelands have increasingly been replaced by crops. Avifaunal studies
   have shown that the population density of several species decreased as
   the proportion of cropland in the landscape increased. The Greater Rhea
   Rhea americana and two migratory sheldgeese: the Upland Goose Chloephaga
   picta and Ashy-headed Goose Chloephaga poliocephala, are medium-large
   native species that have been common and sympatric inhabitants of the
   Pampas ecoregion. We aimed to analyse and compare the current ecological
   niches occupied by the three species during the non-breeding season in
   the southern Pampas of Argentina, the region where their original
   distributions overlapped, using Ecological Niche Factor Analysis. The
   three species showed high global marginality values, indicating that
   they occupied only a specific subset of environmental conditions of
   those available across the region. Suitable areas for Greater Rhea were
   located in the west and south of the study area, overlapping grazing
   lands and native habitats. The three species responded to landscape
   composition and configuration, as indicated by the low proportion of
   areas with suitable conditions for these medium-large birds. Suitable
   areas for Ashy-headed and Upland Geese were especially concentrated in
   the eastern part of the area and suitable areas for Upland Goose were
   more widespread than those suitable for the Ashy-headed Goose. We
   provide compelling evidence of low overlap between the ecological niches
   of the three species in the southern Pampas, which highlights the need
   for specific management strategies to ensure the conservation of these
   emblematic species.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{12-20}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Do livestock grazing and seasonal precipitation structure
   species composition in montane vernal pools? Which grazing and
   precipitation variables best predict cover of vernal pool specialists
   and species with broader habitat requirements? Is vernal pool species
   diversity correlated with livestock exclosure, and at what spatial
   scales?
   Location: Montane vernal pools, northeast California, USA.
   Methods: Vegetation was sampled in 20 vernal pools, including pools
   where livestock had been excluded for up to 20years We compared plant
   species composition, functional group composition and species diversity
   among sites that varied in grazing history and seasonal precipitation
   using CCA and LMM.
   Results: Although vernal pool specialists were dominant in montane
   vernal pools, over a third of plant cover was comprised of species that
   occur over a broad range of wetland or upland environments. The species
   composition of vernal pool plant communities was influenced by both
   livestock grazing and precipitation patterns, however the relative
   effects of these environmental variables differed by functional group.
   Livestock exclosures favoured perennial vernal pool specialists over
   annual vernal pool specialists. In contrast, the cover of habitat
   generalists was more strongly influenced by seasonal precipitation than
   livestock grazing. At small spatial scales, species richness and
   diversity decreased as the number of years a pool had been fenced
   increased, but this relationship was not significant at a larger spatial
   scale.
   Conclusions: Both livestock grazing and seasonal precipitation structure
   the montane vernal pool plant community. We found that livestock grazing
   promotes the cover of annual vernal pool specialists, but at the expense
   of perennial vernal pool specialists. Wetter vernal pools, however,
   support higher cover of wetland generalist species regardless of whether
   pools are grazed.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{45-54}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{QuestionsUnderstanding how livestock grazing alters plant composition in
   low productivity environments is critical to managing livestock
   sustainably alongside native and introduced wild herbivore populations.
   We asked four questions: (1) does recent livestock and rabbit grazing
   reduce some plant attributes more strongly than others; (2) does grazing
   by introduced herbivores (i.e. livestock and rabbits) affect plants more
   strongly than native herbivores (i.e. kangaroos); (3) do the effects of
   recent livestock grazing differ from the legacy effects of livestock
   grazing; and (4) does the probability of occurrence of exotic plants
   increase with increasing net primary productivity (NPP)?
   LocationSouth-eastern Australia.
   MethodsWe measured the recent grazing activity of co-occurring livestock
   (cattle, sheep, goats), rabbits and kangaroos by counting faecal
   pellets; historic grazing activity by measuring livestock tracks; and
   derived NPP from satellite imagery. We used a hierarchical GLMM to
   simultaneously model the presence or absence (i.e. probability of
   occurrence) of all plant species as a function of their attributes
   (growth form, lifespan and origin) to assess their average response to
   recent grazing, historic grazing and productivity in a broad-scale
   regional study.
   ResultsRecent and historic livestock grazing, rabbit grazing and
   increasing NPP reduced the average probability of occurrence of plant
   species, although responses varied among plant attributes. Both recent
   and historic livestock grazing strongly reduced the average probability
   of occurrence of native species, and forbs and geophytes, but differed
   in their relative effects on other growth forms. Recent livestock
   grazing, rabbit grazing and NPP had similar effects, strongly reducing
   native species and forbs, geophytes, shrubs and sub-shrubs. The overall
   effects of recent kangaroo grazing were relatively weak, with no clear
   trends for any given plant attribute.
   ConclusionOur results highlight the complex nature of grazing by
   introduced herbivores compared with native herbivores on different plant
   attributes. Land managers need to be aware that domestic European

Abstract = {{QuestionsCan hemiparasitic Rhinanthus major originating from a local
   population suppress the competitive clonal grass Calamagrostis epigejos
   and reverse its expansion in species-rich semi-natural grasslands? Does
   sowing seeds of R.major facilitate restoration of target meadow
   vegetation? Is R.major more beneficial for biodiversity
   restoration/conservation than increased mowing intensity, a conventional
   measure to suppress C.epigejos?
   Locationertoryje National Nature Reserve, Bile Karpaty (White
   Carpathians) Protected Landscape Area, Czech Republic.
   MethodsWe conducted a before-after-control-impact experiment in meadow
   patches heavily infested by C.epigejos: eight blocks, each containing
   four plots with four treatment combinations: (1) traditional management,
   i.e. mowing once in summer, (2) mowing in summer and autumn (3) mowing
   in summer and seed sowing of R.major, (4) mowing in summer and autumn
   and seed sowing of R.major. Above-ground biomass of C.epigejos and
   vegetation composition of each of the plots were monitored every year
   from 2013 to 2016. To assess the effects of treatments, we analysed
   biomass production of C.epigejos, herb layer cover and vegetation
   composition.
   ResultsBoth sowing R.major and an additional autumn meadow cut
   significantly suppressed C.epigejos. Their effects were additive and of
   comparable size. Both treatments also had significant but markedly
   different effects on community composition. Rhinanthus major facilitated
   directional community composition change towards the regional
   Brachypodio-Molinetum meadows. In contrast, increased mowing intensity
   significantly decreased frequency of threatened species, which however
   may have also been influenced by R.major.
   ConclusionsSowing of autochthonous R.major seeds was demonstrated as an
   efficient tool to suppress C.epigejos and facilitate community
   restoration. It can be combined with an additional meadow cut to further
   accelerate decline of the grass. The additional cut should however be
   used as a short-term practice (1-2years) only to minimize potential
   negative effects of its long-term application on some threatened plant
   species. The effects of R.major are comparable to those of Rhinanthus
   alectorolophus reported previously. As a species occurring naturally in
   species-rich dry grasslands, R.major has a broader and longer-term
   application potential than R.alectorolophus in ecological restoration
   and conservation of these communities.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation status of hay meadows highly depends on their management.
   The main goal of this study was to assess the efficiency of different
   mowing regimes in maintenance of plant species richness and diversity of
   mesic hay meadows. The field experiment was carried out on a species
   rich, mesic hay meadow in Western Hungary. We evaluated the effects of
   four alternative types of management on the plant community after 7
   years of continuous treatment: (1) mowing twice a year, typical
   traditional management, (2) mowing once a year in May, most practised
   currently by local farmers, (3) mowing once a year in September, often
   proposed for conservation management and (4) abandonment of mowing.
   Traditional mowing resulted in significantly higher number and higher
   diversity of vascular plant species than other mowing regimes. Mowing
   twice a year was the only efficient way to control the spread of the
   invasive Solidago gigantea, and mowing in September was more successful
   in it than mowing in May. We conclude that the traditional mowing regime
   is the most suitable to maintain botanical diversity of mesic hay
   meadows; however, other regimes should also be considered if certain
   priority species are targeted by conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The current reality of population growth, resource scarcity, and climate
   change requires resilient agroecosystems to sustain food production and
   protect the environment. This manuscript reflects a combined effort of
   speakers at the 2017 C6 Forage and Grazinglands Division Symposium,
   which was titled ``Resiliency in Forage and Grazinglands.{''} The
   symposium brought together speakers representing a diverse cross-section
   of forage systems across the United States. Each speaker discussed
   resilience-related topics from their specific region, including: the
   importance of diversity and use of complementary forages in grazing
   systems, how grazing and defoliation affect resilience, the importance
   of soil fertility and pest management, and development of decision aids
   to evaluate resilience in grazinglands. Several themes emerged that we
   propose would help improve the resilience of forage and grazingland
   systems: (i) identifying moderately diverse, site-specific mixtures
   (grasses-legumes) for use in specific regions of the United States, (ii)
   greater use of complementary forage species such as C-3 and C-4 grasses
   to lengthen the grazing season and provide a buffer against weather
   variation, (iii) adoption of moderate defoliation intensities to help
   stabilize forage production and species composition, (iv) more attention
   to maintaining and improving soil fertility to improve the productivity
   of desirable forage species and reduce weed pressure, and (v) increase
   adoption of assessment tools to evaluate the relative ``health{''} and
   potential resilience of forage-livestock systems. An integrative
   management approach that combines many of these elements would help
   improve the resilience of forage and grazinglands to sustain high
   productivity under increasingly erratic and extreme weather.}},

Abstract = {{The biodiversity of agricultural land is usually measured via indicator
   species that can be recorded time- and cost-efficiently. Behind this
   approach lies the seldom-questioned assumption that these groups of
   organisms are good at reflecting the overall species diversity of a
   habitat. We tested this assumption by comparing the diversity of
   cow-dung insects with that of grasshopper, butterfly, vascular plant and
   nearby moss and snail communities on 24 pastures on the Swiss Central
   Plateau. The diversity of the vascular plants and mosses increased with
   that of the (often herbivorous) butterflies, grasshoppers and snails,
   both on the sites examined in our study and on those in the wider
   vicinity. By contrast, the diversity of the dung insects (flies and
   parasitic wasps) did not correlate with other groups of organisms.
   Consequently, vascular plants, grasshoppers, butterflies, mosses and
   snails can represent one another well. This is not, however, the case
   for dung insects: they, and hence most likely their functions in
   decomposing dung, are scarcely represented by the commonly used

Abstract = {{In arid environments, grazing by exotic herbivores, including domestic
   livestock, can greatly influence native, small vertebrate assemblages.
   Whether the removal of livestock facilitates passive recovery of these
   assemblages depends on habitat condition and the species present. We
   explore changes in small mammal and reptile species richness, abundance,
   and composition in a degraded chenopod shrubland dominated by Acacia
   victoriae ssp. and open Acacia aneura (mulga) woodland destocked in 1976
   and 1984, respectively. Data were obtained between 1997 and 2007, from
   two grazed and two ungrazed sites in each community. Species richness
   increased at a faster rate in ungrazed open A. aneura woodland, but did
   not differ significantly between ungrazed and grazed degraded chenopod
   shrubland. Subsequent analyses at a finer-scale detected disparate
   responses in richness and abundance for microhabitat. At this scale, a
   greater number of species-specific responses were also detected,
   including increased abundance of generalist species and decreased
   abundance of species requiring low cover. These results reiterate the
   potential for species-specific responses to livestock that are more
   apparent in particular microhabitats. Furthermore, this investigation
   provides evidence for the gradual passive recovery of small mammal and
   reptile assemblages in both communities, which is facilitated by the
   removal of livestock in open A. aneura woodland in fair condition, but
   not degraded chenopod shrubland in poor condition.}},

Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},

Volume = {{70}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Within Europe concerns are rising for the loss of traditional ecological
   knowledge (TEK) as agricultural communities continue to abandon
   traditional practices. TEK consists of a cumulative body of knowledge,
   practice and belief concerning environmental management (specifically
   agricultural management in Europe) that supposedly developed through
   generations of interaction between local communities and their
   environment. However, being based on largely oral accounts concern has
   arisen about the availability and reliability of TEK data - with some
   studies reporting inaccurate or contradictory information. In this paper
   we assess the potential of mainly pre-1800 agricultural texts to
   contribute knowledge to TEK studies. Since 2000, projects to digitise
   and make freely available out-of-copyright books from the world's
   libraries have made many of these pre-industrial agricultural texts
   easily accessible. These sources, we argue, provide a rich source of
   information. Specifically, we observe that knowledge emanating from
   contemporary TEK research can be found within this historical literature
   and question, therefore, whether contemporary European agricultural TEK
   is endogenously developed or represents vestiges of a wider
   pre-industrial agricultural knowledge system. Drawing on the
   English-language literature and using the case of hay meadow management,
   we provide examples of the types of information available, as well as
   detailing three examples of hay meadow management systems that are no
   longer associated with communities of practice - ``fogging{''} of
   meadows, ant-hill management, and open-field, common or Lammas
   management. We conclude that while it may not be possible to reconstruct
   entire agricultural systems from literature-based knowledge, these
   sources can play an important role in complimenting and validating our
   understanding of traditional management systems.}},

Abstract = {{The local scale genetic diversity of Thymus sibthorbii, an aromatic
   species of the Greek flora, was studied both in relation to its habitat
   characteristics. The study was conducted in Cholomontas mountain,
   northern Greece at altitudes of 760-870 m. Genetic material from
   Southern and Northwestern exposures and from different grazing
   intensities within each exposure, was studied using ISSR molecular
   markers. The plant cover at each study site was measured and the
   floristic composition of the site was calculated. The grazing intensity
   affected the species composition and reduced the abundance of T.
   sibthorpii. The floristic diversity in terms of species richness,
   evenness and Shannon index (IF) was higher at the southern sites. Within
   population gene diversity (HE) ranged from 0.203 to 0.245 and Shannon
   index (IG) from 0.311 to 0.377. Most of the genetic diversity resided
   within populations (88\%). Significant genetic differentiation was
   detected among the populations from the southern and northwestern sites,
   as well as among populations of each exposure. Genetic diversity of T.
   sibthorpii was not correlated to species diversity (richness and
   evenness), either within or between populations. Instead, genetic
   diversity was found to be positively correlated with environmental
   factors, such as N soil content and soil moisture.}},

   National Park, Brazil: Outcomes of fire suppression policies}},

Abstract = {{Fire has shaped plant evolution and biogeochemical cycles for millions
   of years in savanna ecosystems, but changes in natural fire regimes
   promoted by human land use threaten contemporary conservation efforts.
   In protected areas in the Brazilian savannas (Cerrado), the predominant
   management policy is fire suppression, reflecting a cultural heritage
   which considers that fire always has a negative impact on biodiversity.
   Here we compare resultant fire-regimes in Canastra National Park (CNP),
   southeast Brazil, associated with areas under and without fire
   suppression management, based on a 16-year Landsat imagery record. In
   open grasslands of the Canastra plateau (CP), firefighting is undertaken
   under government-sanctioned regulation, whereas in the Babilonia sector,
   non-sanctioned fire management is undertaken by small farmers to promote
   cattle grazing and cropping. Fire regimes in the Canastra sector are
   characterized by few, very large, late dry season wildfires recurring at
   intervals of two years. Fire regimes in lowlands of the Babilonia sector
   are characterized by many small-scale, starting at the beginning of the
   dry season (EDS). In Babilonia uplands fire regimes are characterized by
   higher frequencies of large fires. The study illustrates major
   challenges for managing fire-prone areas in conflict-of interest
   regions. We suggest that management planning in CNP needs to effectively
   address: i) managing conflicts between CNP managers and local
   communities; and ii) fire management practices in order to achieve more
   ecologically sustainable fire regimes. The study has broader
   implications for conservation management in fire-prone savannas in South
   America generally. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effects of haying on vegetation communities, taxonomic diversity and

   assessment}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{251}},
Pages = {{48-58}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{In the last years, the use of haying is increasing in Southwest Iberia.
   However, information on its effects on grassland diversity or
   productivity is missing for Mediterranean dry environments. We examined
   the short medium term effects of haying in Alentejo region, South
   Portugal. Our hypotheses were: (1) haying influences plant taxonomic
   diversity, floristic composition, herbage productivity and quality; (2)
   haying effects act both at the field and surrounding of a field levels,
   and depend on yearly weather conditions and on the type of hay produced.
   Floristic inventories were conducted from 2012 to 2015 (121 fields).
   Vegetation samples were collected from 2012 to 2014 (130 fields) and
   analyzed in laboratory for determination of above-ground biomass and
   crude protein content. GLMMs and model averaging were used to model the
   relationship between vegetation parameters and grassland management
   variables. Redundancy analysis was used to analyse compositional changes
   with a special focus on the species with agronomical interest. Annual
   variation and land use were generally better predictors of vegetation
   parameters than haying management variables, with the exception of
   beta-diversity. Fields with higher area of haying in forage crops in the
   previous years presented significantly lower gamma-diversity and in less
   extent, lower alpha-diversity, beta-diversity and leguminous richness.
   beta-diversity was positively influenced by haying in fallow land in the
   surrounding of the field. Leguminous richness and proportion were lower
   in fields with higher area of haying in fallow land in the previous
   years. Crude protein content depended on the interaction between year
   and area of haying in fallow land. In general, communities tended to be
   highly similar in their species composition, but most species of
   agronomical interest were negatively influenced by haying. We conclude
   that haying has an overall moderate effect in Mediterranean dry
   grasslands, and that it is difficult to design management practices that
   simultaneously conciliate plant diversity, leguminous
   richness/proportion and herbage quality.}},

Title = {{Roadside verges as habitats for endangered lizard-orchids

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{607}},
Pages = {{1001-1008}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{Alterations in traditional land use practices have led to severe
   declines in the area of semi-natural grasslands, thereby seriously
   threatening plant and animal species dependent on these habitats. Small
   anthropogenic managed habitats, like roadsides can act as refuges and
   might play an important role in conserving these species. Colonization
   of roadside verges by endangered lizard orchids (Himantoglossum spp.)
   has long been known, but few studies have systematically explored the
   suitability of roadside habitats for these orchids and the impact of
   roads on them. In this paper we present results of targeted surveys of
   three lizard orchid taxa on roadsides from eight European countries.
   During these surveys we searched for lizard orchids inhabiting roadside
   verges and recorded their distance from road, aspects of the roadside
   environment, as well as vegetative and reproductive characteristics of
   individual plants. We found large numbers of lizard orchids on roadside
   verges. Distance from roads was not uniformly distributed: orchids
   occurred more closely to roads than expected by chance. This suggests
   that regular management of roadsides (e.g. mowing) might enhance
   colonization and survival of lizard orchids. On the other hand, we also
   found that close proximity to roads negatively affects reproductive
   success, suggesting that the immediate vicinity of roadsmight act as an
   ecological trap (i.e. favorable in terms of colonization and survival
   but unfavorable in terms of reproduction). Nonetheless, the fact that
   significant and viable populations are maintained at roadsides suggests
   that traditionally managed roadside vergesmay allow long-term
   persistence of lizard orchid populations and may serve as refuges in a
   landscape context. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Complementing endozoochorous seed dispersal patterns by donkeys and
   goats in a semi-natural island ecosystem}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Endozoochory is, in grazing systems, a substantial vector
   for seed dispersal. It can play an important role in vegetation
   dynamics, especially in colonization processes through seed input on the
   vegetation and on the soil seed bank. We investigated the endozoochorous
   seed input of donkeys and goats on a semi-natural island ecosystem in
   the Mediterranean. Through germination experiments, we assessed the
   viable seed content of the dung of these grazing animals to estimate
   their suitability and efficiency for seed dispersal of the vegetation
   types of the island.
   Results: We show different dispersal patterns of donkeys and goats.
   Goats disperse a high number of diaspores from shrubs while donkeys
   disperse more diaspores of grasses. In addition, goats disperse plants
   of greater growth height and donkeys plants of shorter height. These
   dispersal patterns are in accordance with the vegetation types of which
   donkeys and goats disperse indicator species. Both, donkeys and goats,
   feed on and disperse species of the vegetation types, open grassland and
   temporarily wet grassland. In addition, goats feed on and disperse
   diagnostic species of the semi-open maquis and preforest formations.
   Conclusions: Overall, our results show that donkeys and goats are
   complementing each other in their endozoochorous seed dispersal
   potential. This emphasizes the importance of both grazing animals for
   the vegetation dynamics of the semi-natural island ecosystem. Therefore,
   the adaption of the goat management to a traditional land management
   based on directed transhumance might maintain and enrich vegetation
   types.}},

Abstract = {{Field margins are key features for the maintenance of biodiversity and
   associated ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes. Little is
   known about the effects of management practices of old semi-natural
   field margins, and their historical dimension regarding past management
   practices and landscape context is rarely considered. In this paper, the
   relative influence of recent and past management practices and landscape
   context (during the last five years) were assessed on the local
   biodiversity (species richness and composition) of carabid assemblages
   of field margins in agricultural landscapes of northwestern France. The
   results showed that recent patterns of carabid species richness and
   composition were best explained by management practices and landscape
   context measured four or five years ago. It suggests the existence of a
   time lag in the response of carabid assemblages to past environmental
   conditions of field margins. The relative contribution of past
   management practices and past landscape context varied depending on the
   spatial scale at which landscape context was taken into account. Carabid
   species richness was higher in grazed or sprayed field margins probably
   due to increased heterogeneity in habitat conditions. Field margins
   surrounded by grasslands and crops harbored species associated with open
   habitats whilst forest species dominated field margins surrounded by
   woodland. Landscape effect was higher at fine spatial scale, within 50 m
   around field margins. The present study highlights the importance of
   considering time-lagged responses of biodiversity when managing
   environment. It also suggests that old semi-natural field margins should
   not be considered as undisturbed habitats but more as management units
   being part of farming activities in agricultural landscapes, as for
   arable fields. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Market access and community size influence pastoral management of native

Abstract = {{Grazing areas management is of utmost importance in the Andean region.
   In the valleys of the Bolivian Cordillera Real near La Paz, pastoralism
   constitutes the traditional way for people to insure food security and
   economical sustainability. In these harsh mountains, unique and
   productive wetlands sustained by glacial water streams are of utmost
   importance for feeding cattle herds during the dry season. After the
   colonization by the Spanish, a shift in livestock species has been
   observed, with the introduction of exotic species such as cows and
   sheep, resulting in a different impact on pastures compared to native
   camelid species-llamas and alpacas. Here we explored some of the
   social-economical and environmental drivers that motivate Bolivian
   pastoralists to prefer exotic over native livestock species, based on 36
   household surveys in the Cordillera Real. We constructed a Partial Least
   Squares Structural Equation Model in order to assess the relationships
   between these drivers. Our results suggest that the access to market
   influenced pastoralists to reshape their herd composition, by increasing
   the number of sheep. They also suggest that community size increased
   daily grazing time in pastures, therefore intensifying the grazing
   pressure. At a broader scale, this study highlights the effects of some
   social-economical and environmental drivers on mountain herding systems.}},

Volume = {{77}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Feral horses are widespread in the western United States, with the
   majority of feral horse herds found in the Great Basin. There is a
   federal mandate to manage these herds in order to maintain ``ecological
   balance{''}; however, understanding of the specific effects of feral
   horse grazing on rangeland plant communities in this region is
   incomplete. To address this research gap, we utilized long-term grazing
   exclosures and fenceline contrasts to evaluate the impacts of feral
   horses on several plant community variables (diversity, richness,
   dominance, and biomass) and species composition. Because the effects of
   grazing can vary with site precipitation and productivity, we selected 5
   sites from 4 different rangeland types (Great Basin Desert, Colorado
   Plateau, Rocky Mountain grassland, and mixed grass prairie) that spanned
   a mean annual precipitation gradient of 229 to 413 mm. Our results did
   not reveal a significant effect of feral horse grazing on plant
   community composition, species richness, diversity, evenness, or
   dominance. In contrast, total aboveground herbaceous biomass and grass
   biomass were significantly reduced with feral horse grazing, but these
   effects did not vary with mean annual precipitation. Our results suggest
   that, at least at the sites we studied, feral horses have affected the
   plant community by reducing herbaceous biomass but have not caused plant
   community shifts. Additional multisite studies, preferably with
   standardized exclosures and larger sample sizes, would increase our
   understanding of feral horse grazing effects and inform management of
   feral horse herds in the western United States.}},

Title = {{Historical and recent land use affects ecosystem functions in
   subtropical grasslands in Brazil}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Land-use changes such as conversion of semi-natural grasslands to
   agriculture, silviculture, or high-intensity pastures affect
   biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services. However, which
   ecosystem functions are affected when highly diverse grasslands are
   converted remains largely unknown. As a model system, we studied 80
   grasslands in Rio Grande do Sul, southern Brazil, comprising
   exceptionally diverse permanent grasslands that are traditionally
   managed with burning of accumulated biomass and moderate grazing, and
   four additional grassland types with different present or historical
   management: permanent grasslands with reduced or increased current
   management intensity and secondary grasslands after past agricultural or
   silvicultural use. We measured ten ecosystem functions covering all
   major below-and aboveground ecosystem components and the processes that
   link them, using the novel rapid ecosystem function assessment approach.
   Ecosystem functions included primary and secondary production, and
   species interactions, that is, herbivory, pollination, predation, seed
   dispersal, and decomposition. Ecosystem functions differed significantly
   among grassland types, most distinctly between permanent and secondary
   grasslands. Historical land-use changes to agriculture and silviculture
   led to altered ecosystem functions even after reconversion to grassland,
   including lower primary and secondary production, lower decomposition,
   lower seed dispersal capabilities, and higher invertebrate herbivory.
   Current management practices explained additional variation in some
   ecosystem functions, including strong positive effects of intensified
   management on secondary production. Other ecosystem functions such as
   pollination and predation were not affected. The findings suggest that
   conversion of grasslands to more intensive land-use types has
   long-lasting consequences for some ecosystem functions, with effects
   persisting even many years after reconversion, resulting in changes in
   the ecosystem services provided by these grasslands.}},

   grassland birds}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Urban grassy rights-of-way (ROWs) such as along transmission lines could
   be managed cumulatively as collections of potential grassland habitats
   to contribute to the conservation of grassland birds. To optimize
   conservation opportunities, managing urban ROWs for grassland birds may
   require reductions in frequent mowing and spraying and may also depend
   on the suitability of landscape structure within the urban environment.
   We compared effects of mowing regime relative to effects of the matrix
   surrounding ROWs on grassland bird abundance and occupancy along 48 ROWs
   in and surrounding Winnipeg, Manitoba, in 2007-2009. We used both
   hierarchical distance-sampling and multiseason occupancy modeling
   methods to account for effects of urbanization (e.g., traffic noise),
   observer experience, time of season, and survey time in the morning on
   the probability of detecting birds at study sites. We did not find
   differences in detection of grassland birds due to urbanization, but we
   did find effects of time of season, survey time in the morning, and
   observer experience. After accounting for availability, we found that
   several species declined along ROWs that were surrounded by more urban
   or wooded land. Western Meadowlark occupancy increased as the amount of
   grassland within 100 m of ROWs increased. Savannah Sparrow showed some
   evidence of increasing with mowing, whereas Clay-colored Sparrow showed
   some evidence of decreasing with mowing, although these species and
   Western Meadowlark also increased within hayed ROWs. We conclude that
   urban ROWs managed as grassland bird habitats will probably attract more
   individuals and species if there is less nearby urban or wooded land and
   more grassland, and within which there is a mixture of unmowed and hayed
   ROW sections.}},

Title = {{Land Cover Change in Northern Botswana: The Influence of Climate, Fire,
   and Elephants on Semi-Arid Savanna Woodlands}},
Journal = {{LAND}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Complex couplings and feedback among climate, fire, and herbivory drive
   short- and long-term patterns of land cover change (LCC) in savanna
   ecosystems. However, understanding of spatial and temporal LCC patterns
   in these environments is limited, particularly for semi-arid regions
   transitional between arid and more mesic climates. Here, we use
   post-classification analysis of Landsat TM (1990), ETM+ (2003), and OLI
   (2013) satellite imagery to classify and assess net and gross LCC for
   the Chobe District, a 21,000 km(2) area encompassing urban, peri-urban,
   rural, communally-managed (Chobe Enclave), and protected land (Chobe
   National Park, CNP, and six protected forest reserves). We then evaluate
   spatiotemporal patterns of LCC in relation to precipitation, fire
   detections (MCD14M, 2001-2013) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and dry season elephant (Loxodonta africana)
   aerial survey data (2003, 2006, 2012, 2013). Woodland cover declined
   over the study period by 1514 km(2) (16.2\% of initial class total),
   accompanied by expansion of shrubland (1305 km(2), 15.7\%) and grassland
   (265 km(2), 20.3\%). Net LCC differed importantly in protected areas,
   with higher woodland losses observed in forest reserves compared to the
   CNP. Loss of woodland was also higher in communally-managed land for the
   study period, despite gains from 2003-2013. Gross (class) changes were
   characterized by extensive exchange between woodland and shrubland
   during both time steps, and a large expansion of shrubland into
   grassland and bare ground from 2003-2013. MODIS active fire detections
   were highly variable from year to year and among the different protected
   areas, ranging from 1.8 fires{*}year(-1)/km(2) in the Chobe Forest
   Reserve to 7.1 fires{*}year(-1)/km(2) in the Kasane Forest Reserve
   Extension. Clustering and timing of dry season fires suggests that
   ignitions were predominately from anthropogenic sources. Annual fire
   count was significantly related to total annual rainfall (p = 0.009,
   adj. R-2 = 0.50), with a 41\% increase in average fire occurrence in
   years when rainfall exceeded long-term mean annual precipitation (MAP).
   Loss of woodland was significantly associated with fire in locations
   experiencing 15 or more ignitions during the period 2001-2013 (p =
   0.024). Although elephant-mediated damage is often cited as a major
   cause of woodland degradation in northern Botswana, we observed little
   evidence of unsustainable pressure on woodlands from growing elephant
   populations. Our data indicate broad-scale LCC processes in semi-arid
   savannas in Southern Africa are strongly coupled to environmental and
   anthropogenic forcings. Increased seasonal variability is likely to have
   important effects on the distribution of savanna plant communities due
   to climate-fire feedbacks. Long-term monitoring of LCC in these
   ecosystems is essential to improving land use planning and management
   strategies that protect biodiversity, as well as traditional cultures
   and livelihoods under future climate change scenarios for Southern
   Africa.}},

Abstract = {{In several regions in Europe, the horse is becoming a common grazer on
   semi-natural and cultivated grasslands, though the pasturing benefits
   for animals and biodiversity alike are not universally appreciated. The
   composition of ground vegetation on pastures determines the value of
   both the forage for grazing animals as well as the biodiversity values
   for species associated with the pastoral ecosystems. We studied three
   pastures, each representing one of the management types in southern
   Finland (latitudes 60-61): semi-natural, permanent and cultivated
   grassland. All have been grazed exclusively by horses for several
   decades. We aimed to evaluate feeding values and horses' welfare, on the
   one hand, and impacts of horses on biodiversity in boreal conditions, on
   the other. Though there were differences among the pastures, the
   nutritional value of the vegetation in all three pastures met the energy
   and protein needs of most horse categories through the whole grazing
   season. Some mineral concentrations were low compared to the
   requirements, and supplementation of Cu, Zn and Na is needed to balance
   the mineral intake. Only minor injuries or health problems were
   observed. All metrics of biological values, as well as number of species
   eaten by horses, were particularly high in a semi-natural pasture
   compared to other pasture types. The highest ratio of species cover
   preferred by horses to the total cover was found in the permanent
   pasture, while at the regularly re-seeded pasture, there was a
   particularly high cover of species, indicating low biodiversity values
   on grassland. There was, therefore, a trade-off between the quantity of
   forage and biological values in pastures, but not in quality. The
   results provide clear indication both for the suitability of the studied
   pasture types to horses and for grazing of horses for biodiversity
   management. In each pasture type, specific management is needed to
   simultaneously achieve objectives of adequate pasturing and
   biodiversity. The short duration (only one grazing season) must be
   considered when applying the results.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) deposition due to anthropogenic pollution is a major driver
   of the global biodiversity loss. We studied the effect of experimental N
   and phosphorus (P) fertilization (0, 10, 20, and 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)
   and 14 kg P ha(-1) year(-1) over the background deposition levels) on
   plant cover dynamics of a rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.) shrubland
   after 8 years of nutrient addition in a semiarid Mediterranean ecosystem
   from Central Spain. We specifically aimed at testing whether N
   deposition has the potential to influence the observed expanding trend
   of woody vegetation into areas dominated by grassland, biological soil
   crusts, and bare soil. Our results show that N addition loads above 10
   kg N ha(-1) year(-1) reverted the cover dynamics of shrubs. Under N
   addition conditions, N was no longer a limiting nutrient and other
   elements, especially P and calcium, determined the seasonal growth of
   young twigs. Interestingly, N fertilization did not inhibit the growth
   of young shoots; our estimates point to a reduced rosemary leaf lifespan
   that is driving individuals to death. This may be triggered by long-term
   accumulation of N compounds in leaves, suggesting the need to consider
   the old organs and tissues in long-lived perennial plants, where N
   toxicity effects could be more mediated by accumulation processes.
   Shrublands are a widely distributed ecosystem type in biodiverse
   Mediterranean landscapes, where shrubs play a key role as nurse plants.
   Therefore, the disappearance of shrublands may accelerate the
   biodiversity loss associated with other global change drivers, hamper
   the recruitment of seedlings of woody species, and, as a consequence,
   accelerate desertification.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use change and homogenization of the landscape are severe threats
   to butterfly diversity. The break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to
   land abandonment on very large scales. This study aims at assessing the
   impact of the ongoing abandonment of traditionally managed grasslands
   and subsequent vegetation succession on butterflies in Western Siberia,
   a species-rich area with butterfly communities similar to those of
   Central and Eastern European grasslands. 20 mown and 20 abandoned
   grasslands were surveyed using Distance Sampling methods in summer 2015.
   We recorded 997 individuals from 44 species, pooled over two sampling
   events. An indicator species analysis and detrended correspondence
   analysis revealed that communities likely underwent changes in species
   composition during succession, and that habitat specialization
   decreased. In contrast to previous studies we found no evidence of early
   stages of abandonment being more species-rich than mown meadows. On
   unmanaged grasslands litter cover and litter depth were significantly
   higher than on mown grasslands. Half of the abandoned sites were
   riparian meadows. The dynamics and ecological characteristics of the
   floodplain had a stronger influence on community composition than land
   use. This study shows that structural heterogeneity and lepidopteran
   diversity of the vast, but understudied, Western Siberian grasslands are
   driven by mechanic and natural disturbance. Conservation should aim at
   responding to trends of abandonment and actively maintaining a mosaic
   with grasslands of different successional stages.}},

Abstract = {{Urbanisation is a rapidly ongoing process worldwide with profound
   consequences for wildlife in urban and peri-urban areas. Species are
   affected by habitat loss, habitat alternation and degradation,
   fragmentation and increased human population and activity. Habitat loss
   can occur due to construction of housing and infrastructure in
   peri-urban areas and within urban areas due to compaction. Undeveloped
   areas can also be changed from ruderal land, wilderness areas or
   leftover green space to more formal and more intensively used urban
   green space. This study investigated a butterfly species, the scarce
   copper (Lycaena virgaureae L.), in an urbanising and expanding
   settlement in a rural location in southern Sweden. The scarce copper is
   still relatively common in Sweden, but has experienced severe decline in
   certain areas and in other parts of Europe. Patch occupancy and
   abundance of the species were investigated in 44 patches ranging from
   urban and peri-urban to rural locations. Habitats investigated were
   parks, urban grasslands managed for biodiversity by the local authority,
   unmanaged abandoned arable sites, road verges, meadows and pastures. In
   total, 624 sightings of scarce coppers were recorded. The highest
   abundances were observed in larger unmanaged patches and in meadows in
   peri-urban areas, while pastures had low abundances. In urban parks, no
   coppers were found. The smaller sites managed for biodiversity by the
   local authority within the settlement were often occupied by the scarce
   copper, although abundances were low (mean number of individuals 3 +/-
   1.2). In patches which were cut, copper numbers dropped in almost all
   cases to zero after cutting. Patch occupancy was affected by habitat
   characteristics such vegetation height, tree succession, abundance of
   Rumex acetosella (sheep's sorrel), as well as landscape features such as
   length of forest edge. Factors identified as influencing abundance were
   the same, but additionally also flower abundance. The current high
   abundances of the scarce copper in the area will not be ensured in the
   longer term when all building plans are implemented and no other
   measures are taken. Recommendations are made on management and planning
   to preserve the species in the study area.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{3289-3305}},

Abstract = {{Land management practices directly impact on the occurrence and
   condition of natural capital stocks, which can be measured using species
   diversity and abundance metrics. Species identity and abundance drive
   ecosystem service supply, either through effects of local diversity
   and/or through the presence of service providing species. However, the
   influence of management practices on the provision of ecosystem services
   is not adequately understood. We grouped grassland plant species into
   six groups according to desirable attributes (palatability and
   nutritional value to livestock; medicinal or aromatic compounds; nectar
   production; pollen production; nitrogen fixation; and endemic and red
   listed species), which we recognise as ecosystem service `provider
   groups', and tested the influence of three land management practices
   (abandonment of mowing, grazing, and mowing) on diversity and abundance
   within these groups in upland temperate grasslands of Transylvania
   (Romania). All three management practices favoured at least one provider
   group, but hay making in upland grasslands favoured more provider groups
   than abandonment of mowing or grazing. The effects of management on
   diversity and abundance within several provider groups diverged from the
   effects on overall species diversity and abundance. Management, through
   changes in species composition, favours certain provider groups, and
   hence ecosystem services, over others. The provider group approach is
   more useful than overall species diversity metrics for assessing the
   provision of ecosystem services from landscapes and can be used to
   inform the development of agri-environment schemes and conservation
   policies aimed at meeting priorities for ecosystem service provision.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands belong to the ecologically most relevant habitats in cultural
   landscapes, but also provide high economic value when used as meadows or
   pastures. Land-use intensification in grasslands negatively affects
   plant diversity as well as arthropod communities that depend on plants
   as food source and habitat, with important consequences for the
   provision and resilience of ecosystem functioning. In this study, we
   sampled grassland moth species and investigated whether species
   composition, diversity and life-history trait characteristics of moth
   communities respond to the type and intensity of land use, comparing 26
   sites in three different regions of Germany. Consistent across the three
   regions, we found that pastures grazed by cattle, horses or sheep
   harbour fundamentally different moth communities than meadows (mown and
   fertilized grasslands). Overall land-use intensity (LUI)-i.e., grazing
   intensity, amount of fertilizer applied and mowing frequency taken
   together-significantly reduced abundance and species richness as well as
   diversity. Some 27.6\% of the species showed significant negative
   responses to LUI. A shift towards generalist life-history traits was
   observed: in frequently mown and fertilized meadows, rare specialist
   species were replaced by ubiquist species, i.e., highly reproductive
   habitat generalists. These results show the sensitivity of moths, an
   important group of arthropod herbivores and pollinators, to land use
   change in grassland ecosystems. The functional homogenization of
   life-history traits in plants along land-use gradients is mirrored by
   their herbivore consumers, leaving high-intensity grasslands less
   diverse and potentially less resilient to environmental disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of seagrass habitat for the diversity of benthic fauna
   has been extensively studied worldwide. Most of the information
   available is, however, about a diversity while little consideration has
   been given to 13 diversity. To fill the knowledge gaps regarding the
   variability of epifaunal and infaunal seagrass assemblages at large
   spatial and temporal scales, we scrutinized an extensive dataset
   covering five years of monitoring of eight intertidal Zostera marina
   meadows around Brittany (France). High species richness arose at the
   regional scale from the combination of high local diversity of the
   meadows and substantial among-meadows 13 diversity. Epifauna and infauna
   appeared as distinct self-communities as they displayed different
   spatial and temporal patterns and varied in their responses to local
   hydrological conditions. Infauna had higher total 13 diversity than
   epifauna due to a tighter link to the great variability of local
   environmental conditions in the region. Both exhibited substantial
   variations in species composition and community structure with
   variations of dominant species that were accompanied by extensive change
   in numerous rare species. The dominant epifaunal species were all
   grazers. Changes in species composition were induced mostly by species
   replacement and rarely by richness differences between meadows. Indeed,
   species richness remained within a narrow range for all seagrass beds,
   suggesting a potential carrying capacity for species richness of the
   meadows. Overall, all meadows contributed equally to the regional
   turnover of seagrass macrofauna, emphasizing high variability and
   complementarity among beds at the regional scale. The implications of
   this substantial within-seagrass variability for the functioning of
   benthic ecosystems at broad scale and for conservation purposes in
   habitat mosaics warrant further investigations but our results clearly
   advocate taking into account within-habitat variation when evaluating
   the diversity of benthic habitats and the potential effect of habitat
   loss.}},

Abstract = {{The alpine meadow has received mounting attention due to its degradation
   resulting from overgrazing on the Tibetan Plateau. However, belowground
   biotic characteristics under varied grazing stresses in this ecosystem
   are poorly understood.
   Here, the responses of soil protozoan abundance, community composition,
   microbial biomass, and enzyme activity to five grazing patterns
   including (1) artificial grassland without grazing (AG), (2) winter
   grazing (WG), (3) grazing for 7 months within a fence (GF), (4)
   continuous grazing for a whole year (CG), and (5) natural heavy grazing
   (HG) were investigated for two continuous years. Soil protozoan
   community composition was investigated using the most possible number
   (MPN) method, and soil microbial biomass and enzyme activity were
   analyzed using chloroform fumigation extraction and substrate
   utilization methods, respectively. Multivariate statistical analysis,
   the analysis of variance (ANOVA), multiple comparisons, and correlation
   analysis were together performed.
   The WG treatment had the highest abundance of total protozoa (2342-2524
   cell g(-1)). Compared with AG treatment, HG treatment significantly
   reduced the abundance of soil total, flagellate and ciliate protozoa,
   and protease activities in 2012 and 2013. Significantly, lower soil
   microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) was also observed in the HG (6.60 and
   14.6 mg N kg(-1)) than those in other four treatments (22.3-82.9 mg N
   kg(-1)) both in 2012 and 2013, whereas significantly higher microbial
   biomass carbon (MBC) was observed in HG than that in AG treatment in
   2012. Moreover, significantly positive correlations were detected
   between the abundance of soil protozoa and soil moisture, pH, organic C,
   total N, and MBN. Our results indicated that soil protozoa showed a
   negative response to increasing grazing intensities and therefore,
   suggesting that aboveground grazing practices also exerted strong impact
   on belowground protozoa, not only on soil microbial characteristics.
   Soil protozoan community composition was apparently different between
   the HG treatment and other four grazing patterns and was potentially
   impacted by altered soil properties and MBC and/or MBN. Our results
   suggested that moderate grazing may sustain better belowground biotic
   diversity and ecosystem functioning in this alpine meadow on the Tibetan
   Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{Past intensive land use complicates the successful restoration of
   oligotrophic species-rich grassland types. One of the major bottlenecks
   are the elevated nutrient levels due to fertilization, especially
   residual phosphorus (P). Aiming to deplete nutrients, managers often
   reintroduce traditional haymaking management, sometimes combined with
   grazing. Here, we evaluate whether this technique restores the abiotic
   and biotic boundary conditions for restoration of Nardus grassland.
   Seven grasslands were selected in Flanders, Belgium, which had elevated
   nutrient levels after the cessation of intensive agriculture 16-24 years
   ago, and which have been mown and grazed since. We compared soil and
   vegetation data of these postfertilization grasslands with 34
   well-developed oligotrophic Nardus grasslands. Mowing and grazing did
   not cause community composition to resemble that of Nardus grassland.
   Furthermore, bioavailable P-concentrations were significantly higher in
   the postfertilization grasslands and P-limitation was not obtained.
   Restoring P-poor soil conditions through continued mowing and grazing
   management would take at least decades. Phosphorus-mining can shorten
   the restoration time by increased P-removal. Given our results, we
   propose a decision framework to aid planners and managers in their
   choice of interventions. Cost-effective efforts for restoration should
   be well-prepared, including measurements of important initial soil
   characteristics. This allows for an evaluation of distance to target and
   the selection of an effective restoration technique. These techniques
   may involve cutting the mowing tradition, and utilizing P-mining or
   topsoil removal instead.}},

Journal = {{SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{115}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Soil respiration is often used as an index of fertility because the
   majority of nutrients are cycled through the microbial biomass. We
   assessed the role of soil respiration as a measure of resource
   productivity in three long-term grassland experiments near
   Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. All of these experiments have shown
   significant changes in grass species composition and productivity. An
   ongoing Veld (=field) Fertilizer Experiment (VFE) that manipulated the
   level of nitrogen fertilizer, phosphorus and lime has been running since
   1951. A Burning and Mowing Experiment (BME) has been running since 1950.
   The third experiment is part of the Nutrient Network (NutNet), a global
   fertilizer experiment that has been manipulating nitrogen, phosphorus,
   potassium and micronutrients and has been running since 2009. We found
   that longer-term experiments were more likely to show significant
   effects on soil respiration. We found several significant effects in the
   VFE but no significant differences in soil respiration among
   fertilization treatments in the shortest-term experiment (NutNet). In
   the VFE, we found significant differences in soil respiration due to
   levels of nitrogen fertilizer, form of nitrogen fertilizer (limestone
   ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate), phosphorus and lime. We found
   no significant relationship between above-ground net primary
   productivity and soil respiration despite the frequent detection of such
   a pattern due to the link between soil respiration, soil fertility and
   productivity. We found that, while there was a consistent increase in
   total soil nitrogen with increasing levels of nitrogen fertilizer
   applied, there was a consistent decrease in soil microbial respiration.
   There was a significant positive correlation between soil respiration
   and pH. Possible mechanisms behind this are unclear but may involve
   changes in dominant enzymes and possibly switches between dominance of
   bacteria and fungi. We also found significant effects of the timing of
   burning in the BME, but not due to the frequency of burning or the
   occurrence of mowing. Our results suggest that studies may need to be
   long-term, for example here at least 10 years, before key functional
   relationships with soil fertility can be reliably understood. (C) 2017

   abandoned, dry sandy grassland and heathland communities by supressing
   Calamagrostis epigejos and enhancing species richness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION}},

Abstract = {{The spread of competitive grasses, changes in species composition and
   vegetation structure are direct consequences of grassland and heathland
   abandonment. As an alternative to more costly management measures such
   as traditional pastoralism, year-round low-intensity grazing with large
   herbivores is increasingly used to restore and maintain semi-open
   habitats. However, the suitability of this grazing regime has not yet
   been investigated for long-abandoned, highly degraded but nutrient-poor
   sandy grassland and heathland communities. In particular, it is unclear
   if year-round grazing is suitable for preventing the further spread of
   highly competitive grasses such as Calamagrostis epigejos while
   simultaneously maintaining or improving characteristic species richness
   and vegetation structure. Hence, we conducted a comprehensive field
   study on two spatial scales (plot-level: 25 m(2), macroplot-level: 1 ha)
   to analyse the impacts of year-round low-intensity cattle and horse
   grazing on the development of the highly competitive grass Calamagrostis
   epigejos, as well as the vegetation structure and plant species richness
   of long-abandoned but nutrient-poor dry sandy grassland and heathland
   communities, their mosaics and Calamagrostis stands within an 800 ha
   heathland between 2008 and 2015. Finally, we assessed the local
   conservation status of the habitat types after seven years of grazing in
   comparison to long-abandoned sites.
   Grazing successfully reduced the coverage of Calamagrostis epigejos,
   whereby Calamagrostis stands developed towards species-rich sandy
   grasslands after seven years of grazing. In addition, the quality of the
   vegetation structure was improved by enhancing the proportion of bare
   soil, while litter and grass cover, litter thickness and height of the
   field layer as well as the coverage of ruderal indicators were
   significantly reduced on grazed sites in comparison to ungrazed sites in
   2015. Moreover, we found an overall positive grazing effect on species
   richness: Total species number, number of target species as well as
   subordinated target species significantly increased within the
   vegetation types over time.
   Thus, year-round low-intensity cattle and horse grazing is a suitable
   management tool for restoring, maintaining and even improving
   long-abandoned, nutrient-poor sandy grassland and heathland communities,
   and thus to enhance the local conservation status of the habitat types.
   However, if there is a high initial cover of woody species (e.g. shrubs,
   tree rejuvenation), then an extensive shrub and tree clearance will be
   necessary, with manual shrub cutting being crucial to reduce the heavy
   regrowth of the woody species. In addition, a one-time mowing should be
   implemented in highly degraded heaths to facilitate the vegetative
   rejuvenation of degenerate stands of Calluna vulgaris, thus improving
   its attractiveness for the grazing animals.}},

Journal = {{AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The use of agrochemicals is expected to increase with the global
   expansion of oil palm plantations. In line with environmentally
   sustainable palm oil certification, targeted grazing can minimize the
   dependency on herbicides for controlling weeds in plantations. Here, we
   show for the first time that targeted grazing would control weeds and
   improve biodiversity of desired animal species. We sampled birds at 45
   oil palm plantations in Peninsular Malaysia that were systematically
   grazed, non-systematically grazed, or herbicide-controlled plantations
   without cattle grazing. We found that bird species richness increased
   with size of grazing area, but decreased with number of cattle. Bird
   abundance was higher in the systematic grazing system, but negatively
   related to number of cattle. These factors explained 18.41 and 25.34\%
   of the observed variations in bird species richness and abundance,
   respectively. Our findings suggest that targeted cattle grazing can be
   instrumental for transforming conventional oil palm agriculture into
   more biodiversity-friendly agroecosystems. Targeted grazing is likely to
   be practical under field conditions in major palm oil producing
   countries. In addition, the use of targeted grazing as a biological
   control method for weeds would be welcomed by palm oil consumers and
   encouraged by sustainable palm oil certification bodies such as the
   Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).}},

Title = {{The importance of trees for woody pasture bird diversity and effects of
   the European Union's tree density policy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1638-1647}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Recent reforms in the Common Agricultural Policy aim for a greening
   of the subsidy system with potential improvements for biodiversity
   conservation. As part of that process, the tree density limit for
   pastures to qualify for European Union subsidies has been increased from
   50 to 100 trees per hectare. However, recent studies show that the high
   biodiversity values of these habitats may be threatened by these limits,
   highlighting the need for policy improvements. Still, little is known
   about the direct effects of tree density limitations on bird communities
   in woody pastures.
   2. We investigated how bird diversity and species composition are
   affected by tree density in 49 Swedish woody pastures along a gradient
   of 4-214 trees per hectare. We recorded bird communities, tree density
   and stand structure estimates in the field and estimated forest cover in
   the surrounding landscape from aerial photos. Using generalised additive
   models and redundancy analysis, we analysed how bird territorial species
   richness, bird abundance and species composition are affected by tree
   density, taking into account other local and landscape scale explanatory
   variables.
   3. Tree density had a significant positive effect on bird species
   richness at low tree densities and species richness saturated at
   approximately 50 trees per hectare. Shrub density had a significant
   positive linear effect on both bird species richness and abundance. Tree
   and shrub density were also the major drivers of bird community
   composition, with secondary effects of tree species diversity and
   landscape forest cover.
   4. Policy implications. Our results show that tree density is not the
   limiting factor, but rather a driver of bird diversity and species
   composition in woody pastures and that tree density limits may fail to
   capture the whole range of biological values. To improve policy
   recommendations, we therefore stress the importance of considering
   additional social-ecological drivers associated to management quality,
   e.g. taking into account moral and cultural motivations among farmers,
   to preserve biodiversity in woody pastures.}},

Title = {{Remnant vegetation, plantings and fences are beneficial for reptiles in
   agricultural landscapes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1710-1719}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Managing agricultural landscapes for biodiversity conservation is
   increasingly difficult as land use is modified or intensified for
   production. Finding ways to mitigate the negative effects of agriculture
   on biodiversity is therefore critical. We asked the question: How do
   remnant patches, paddock types and grazing regimes influence reptile
   assemblages in a grazing landscape?
   2. At 12 sites, we surveyed reptiles and environmental covariates in
   remnant woodland patches and in four paddock types: (i) grazed pasture,
   (ii) linear plantings, (iii) coarse woody debris (CWD) added to grazed
   pasture and (iv) fences between grazed pasture. Each site was either
   continuously or rotationally grazed.
   3. Remnant vegetation and other vegetation attributes such as tree cover
   and leaf litter greatly influenced reptiles. We recorded higher reptile
   abundance and species richness in areas with more tree cover and leaf
   litter. For rare species (captured in <= 4 sites < 70 captures), there
   were 5.7 more animals and 2.6 more species in sites with 50\% woody
   cover within 3 km compared to 5\% woody cover.
   4. The abundance and richness of rare species, and one common species
   differed between paddock types and were higher in linear plantings and
   fence transects compared to CWD and pasture transects.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Grazed paddocks, particularly those with
   key features such as fences and plantings can provide habitat for
   reptiles. This suggests that discrete differentiation between patch and
   matrix does not apply for reptiles in these systems. Management to
   promote reptile conservation in agricultural landscapes should involve
   protecting existing remnant vegetation, regardless of amount; and
   promote key habitat features of trees, leaf litter and shrubs.
   Establishing plantings and fences is important as they support high
   numbers of less common reptiles and may facilitate reptiles to move
   through and use greater amounts of the landscape.}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Leafhoppers and related Auchenorrhynchous Hemiptera (AH) are among the
   most diverse grassland herbivores, and many have been linked inexorably
   to grassland vegetation through diet and shelter for millions of years.
   Are AH-plant communities in natural grasslands tightly integrated, how
   does the interaction differ across major ecological gradients, and do
   habitat or environmental factors explain the most variance in AH
   community structure? These questions have implications for the
   conservation of biodiversity and in evaluating effects of a warming
   climate. Using grasslands of the central Tien Shan Mountains as a
   natural laboratory, we examine whether AH species assemblages are
   concordant with vegetation in terms of community structure using closely
   associated species-level samples. Data were recorded from a nearly
   3000-m elevation gradient crossing four arid and three montane grassland
   vegetation classes. We found elements of AH-plant community
   classification and structure to be closely correlated except for at the
   arid-montane habitat transition where a small group of widespread AH
   species were significant indicators for vegetation classes in both major
   grassland types. AH species richness and abundance are positively
   correlated with plant species density and percent cover and,
   correspondingly, peak at mid-elevations in association with montane
   grasslands. While overall elevation (and covariate mean annual
   temperature) explains the most variance in AH species assemblages, the
   sum total of habitat factors explain more variance than environmental
   factors when arid and montane grasslands were examined separately, but
   environmental factors are co-equal with habitat factors when the
   grassland types are combined. Unexplained variance in the AH community
   assemblages, attributable to individualistic species responses to
   environmental and habitat factors, slightly exceeds the total accounted
   for by the model.}},

Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},

Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{564-576}},

Abstract = {{Traditional rural biotopes (TRBs) are threatened habitats that host
   significant biodiversity and several ecosystem services, and depend on
   active management such as low-intensity grazing. The current study
   explores private landowners' decision-making on TRB management and
   abandonment within a social-ecological system framework. We provide
   insight into supporting resilience of TRB systems in the face of
   agricultural modernization. Using a mixed methods approach with content
   analysis and Q analysis, we demonstrate that TRB management fosters
   cultural, biological, aesthetic, and utilitarian values. These are
   reflected in different ways through conservationist's, profit-oriented
   farmer's, landscape manager's, and landscape admirer's discourses on TRB
   management. Overall, management reinforces landowners' place attachment,
   and reflects an approach to landscapes as spatial representations of
   cultural heritage and identity over multiple generations. Landowners
   consider TRB pasturage and its social-ecological outcomes motivating and
   rewarding. Giving up grazing cattle and perceived bureaucracy of
   national agri-environment scheme contribute to TRB abandonment.
   Landowners point out that current policies detach TRB management from
   what is seen as ``regular agriculture{''}, and the focus on monetary
   compensation bypasses the multiple values tied to TRB management. Based
   on our results, we suggest that promoting TRBs requires reconfiguring
   the current arrangement of remedial management payments and adopting a
   more participatory governance approach. Locally, resilience of TRB
   systems relies on the connections between landowners and landscapes that
   foster sense of place and landscape identity, which can be supported by
   knowledge sharing and collaborative grazing efforts among landowners.}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been demonstrated to influence
   many ecological processes in their natural ecosystems. However, little
   is known about how AMF communities respond to gradient warming and
   grazing, especially winter grazing. In the present study, we conducted
   an experiment to examine the interaction between warming and winter
   grazing, simulated by clipping before the growing season, to measure
   changes in the AMF community across a warming gradient with and without
   winter clipping in an alpine meadow ecosystem. A total of 63 phylotypes
   of AMF were identified using 454 pyrosequencing. Both warming and
   clipping reduced AMF species richness, but had no additive negative
   effects. The clipping alone and the interaction between warming and
   clipping changed the AMF species composition, but not its phylogenetic
   composition. The phylogenetic structure of AMF communities were
   dramatically changed from phylogenetically random to convergent across
   our warming gradient under the unclipped treatments and were
   phylogenetically random in all treatments with clipping. Our findings
   suggest that the primary ecological processes determining AMF
   communities shift from stochastic processes to habitat filtering across
   our warming gradient under the unclipped treatments, whilst there was no
   such shift under the clipped treatments. This study highlights that the
   removal of standing dead biomass through winter grazing serves a key
   role in regulating soil microbial diversity in the much warmer world.}},

Abstract = {{The intensification of livestock farming and use of arable forage crops
   has led to a decrease in the area of grassland used for animal
   husbandry. One potentially profitable use of this grassland is the
   production of bio-mass for bioenergy. The C4 grass miscanthus
   (Miscanthus spp.) is considered an important biomass resource for
   bioenergy production; however, its cultivation is currently limited by
   the shortage of suitable agricultural land. The establishment of
   miscanthus on permanent grassland, at low densities and without
   destruction of the existing vegetation, could be an interesting option
   to consider. In this way, the expansion of miscanthus cultivation could
   be combined with grassland maintenance. Conventional tilling practices
   in miscanthus establishment (ploughing and herbicide application) on
   meadows can lead to loss of biodiversity. The aim of this study was to
   investigate efficient no-till practices for establishment and
   maintenance of several miscanthus genotypes on permanent grassland in
   Germany, focusing on the methods to improve establishment success and
   biomass production potential of miscanthus-supplemented grassland. A
   field trial was conducted at two sites to assess the effect of genotype,
   grassland pre-treatment (through temporary suppression of existing
   vegetation to reduce initial competition) and management (harvest
   frequencies) on miscanthus establishment and growth in grassland stands.
   An additional experiment with two miscanthus genotypes was set up to
   assess the effect of propagation method (rhizomes or pre-grown
   plantlets) on miscanthus establishment on grassland. Successful
   miscanthus establishment was achieved with no-till planting and
   grassland pre-treatment. Overall, miscanthus genotypes with tall, thick
   shoots performed better on grassland than those with short, thin shoots.
   Higher establishment rates were achieved through the transplanting of
   rhizome-derived (pre-grown) plantlets than with direct planting of
   rhizomes. Cutting the grassland vegetation to a stubble height of 5 cm
   and spraying herbicide in narrow strips before introducing miscanthus
   had beneficial effects on its establishment, without significant
   negative impact on grassland productivity. In the first three years of
   the study, two biomass harvests per growing season allowed a good total
   biomass yield from grassland to be achieved without significant impact
   on miscanthus growth.}},

Year = {{2017}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing can trigger outbreaks of insect pests in steppe
   ecosystems of Inner Mongolia in China. However, the physiological
   responses of the grasshopper Chorthippus albonemus to grazing are not
   well-understood. Here we investigated the effects of sheep grazing on
   the population dynamics and transcriptomic response of C. albonemus. We
   collected the insects three times (about 20 days apart) in 1.33-ha plots
   in which there were no grazing, light grazing, moderate grazing, heavy
   grazing, or overgrazing. Our results showed that continuous grazing
   significantly decreased plant biomass and influenced plant succession.
   Total insect species diversity significantly declined along the grazing
   intensity gradient and over time. Results of the first two collections
   of C. albonemus indicated that moderate grazing significantly increased
   the abundance of C. albonemus. However, abundance was significantly
   decreased in plots that were overgrazed, possibly because of food stress
   and environmental pressures. Under moderate grazing, betA and CHDH genes
   were significantly upregulated in C. albonemus. In response to higher
   grazing intensity, upregulated genes included those involved in
   serine-type peptidase activity, anatomical structure development, and
   sensory organ development; downregulated genes included those involved
   in the structural constituents of the ribosome and ribosome processes.
   Genes strongly upregulated in response to heavy grazing pressure
   included adaptive genes such as those encoding ankyrin repeat
   domain-containing protein and HSP. These findings improve our
   understanding of the role of the transcriptome in C. albonemus
   population response to livestock grazing and may provide useful targets
   for grasshopper control.}},

Title = {{Fine-scale root community structure and below-ground responses to
   grazing show independence from above-ground patterns}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1097-1106}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Question: Root biomass distribution and below-ground processes are the
   main drivers of plant community structure and dynamics in arid
   rangelands. However, despite their relevance, below-ground plant
   responses to disturbance regimes remain poorly understood. This
   knowledge is a pressing issue since most of our ideas derive from
   extrapolating above-ground ecological theory and data. Here, we asked
   how domestic grazing management changes (intensification and
   abandonment) impact on both below-ground species co-occurrence at
   microsite level (point-richness) in relation to above-ground patterns
   and below-ground biomass distribution of dominant graminoid species
   across different soil layers.
   Location: Patagonian steppe, Argentina.
   Methods: We sampled and compared ungrazed, moderately grazed and
   intensively grazed steppes. We evaluated below-and above-ground
   point-richness (microsite level: 6-cm diameter), as well as total and
   specific root biomass in the top 20 cm of soil along 50-m transects in
   commercial paddocks.
   Results: We found independence between fine-scale below-and above-ground
   responses. Below-ground point-richness was at least three times higher
   than above-ground point-richness. Besides, below-ground point-richness
   decreased from 4.2 species in ungrazed sites to 3.4 species in
   intensively grazed ones. Neither grazing intensification nor abandonment
   changed total root biomass, although intensification changed the root
   biomass composition, reducing preferred and increasing non-preferred
   grass species. Strikingly, below-ground point-richness and total root
   biomass did not differ between microsites covered and not covered by
   vegetation. This pattern was not affected by grazing.
   Conclusions: Our findings showed a higher degree of fine-scale
   below-ground species co-occurrence than above-ground in this Patagonian
   steppe. The intensification of grazing slightly decreased below-ground
   species co-occurrence and changed root composition (species abundance),
   although grazing management did not modify the high degree of
   independence between below-and above ground structure. Even though
   intensive grazing markedly decreases above ground biomass, total
   below-ground biomass does not vary along a wide range of grazing
   conditions. In general, most of our knowledge about vegetation responses
   to grazing is based on above-ground information, assuming that
   below-ground patterns and processes are analogous to those above-ground.
   This study suggests that below-and above-ground community structure at
   fine-scale are not strongly correlated and they can be differentially
   affected by grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Juniperus is an evergreen gymnosperm genus with a broad geographical
   distribution in the Northern Hemisphere. Juniperus constitutes important
   vegetation associations in the Himalayan highlands that have significant
   ecological and socioeconomic importance. This research investigated the
   distribution pattern, community structure, and ecosystem services
   provided by Juniperus-dominated subalpine vegetation in the upper Neelum
   Valley, Pakistan. Vegetation attributes and geographical characteristics
   were systematically recorded at 4 selected sites. Two species of
   Juniperus, Juniperus communis L. and J. excelsa M. Bieb., were found to
   have average importance values of 23.4 and 20.02\%, respectively. J.
   excelsa showed an average basal area of 0.30 m(2) ha(-1) and an average
   stem density of 46.95 ha(-1); J. communis had an average basal area of
   0.25 m(2) ha(-1) and an average stem density of 33.21 ha(-1). A total of
   56 Juniperus-associated plant species from 29 families were recorded,
   with Asteraceae as the dominant family, followed by Lamiaceae,
   Polygonaceae, Rosaceae, Caryophyllaceae, and Apiaceae. Predominant
   associated species included Thymus linearis, Aster falconeri, Rosa
   webbiana, Berberis lyceum, Anagallis arvensis, Rumex nepalensis, Poa
   alpina, Bistorta affinis, and Iris hookeriana. The calculated average
   values were Shannon's diversity, 3.07; Simpson's diversity, 0.94;
   species richness, 1.11; species evenness, 0.90; and maturity index,
   45.90. Hemicryptophytes were the dominant lifeform in the area
   (57.14\%), and microphylls (46.42\%) were the dominant leaf type.
   Overgrazing and fuelwood cutting were identified as serious threats to
   both Juniperus species. Restoration of the degraded juniper stands
   through collective efforts by government and local communities and
   regular monitoring is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{High biodiversity is known to increase many ecosystem functions, but
   studies investigating biodiversity effects have more rarely looked at
   multi-trophic interactions. We studied a tri-trophic system composed of
   Centaurea jacea (brown knapweed), its flower head-infesting tephritid
   fruit flies and their hymenopteran parasitoids, in a grassland
   biodiversity experiment. We aimed to disentangle the importance of
   direct effects of plant diversity (through changes in apparency and
   resource availability) from indirect effects (mediated by host plant
   quality and performance). To do this, we compared insect communities in
   C. jacea transplants, whose growth was influenced by the surrounding
   plant communities (and where direct and indirect effects can occur),
   with potted C. jacea plants, which do not compete with the surrounding
   plant community (and where only direct effects are possible). Tephritid
   infestation rate and insect load, mainly of the dominant species
   Chaetorellia jaceae, decreased with increasing plant species and
   functional group richness. These effects were not seen in the potted
   plants and are therefore likely to be mediated by changes in host plant
   performance and quality. Parasitism rates, mainly of the abundant
   chalcid wasps Eurytoma compressa and Pteromalus albipennis, increased
   with plant species or functional group richness in both transplants and
   potted plants, suggesting that direct effects of plant diversity are
   most important. The differential effects in transplants and potted
   plants emphasize the importance of plant-mediated direct and indirect
   effects for trophic interactions at the community level. The findings
   also show how plant-plant interactions critically affect results
   obtained using transplants. More generally, our results indicate that
   plant biodiversity affects the abundance of higher trophic levels
   through a variety of different mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae) is an annual weed of worldwide
   significance in grasslands and riparian corridors. In view of the
   invasibility and known allelochemical properties exhibited by its
   presence in a given habitat, the weed is hypothesized to change soil
   properties significantly.
   Soil samples were collected in Parthenium weed invaded and non-invaded
   vegetation patches over two years and across twelve sites in central and
   south east Queensland of three land-use types, and analyzed for
   differences in physicochemical and biotic contents.
   Soil response to the weed invasion varied significantly between years,
   regions, sites, and land-use types (riparian corridor > grazing
   grassland cropping land), but invasion impact was minimal. Overall,
   there was a tendency for increased soil major nutrients and microbial
   traits with Parthenium weed invasion. However, the differences, using
   conventional parametric statistics and bias-corrected Hedges' effect
   size procedures were non-significant - due to a lack of consistency in
   the direction or magnitude of the impact. In five sites, the 95\%
   confidence intervals of mean impact of the effect size estimates spanned
   both the null and the rejection regions, indicating data insensitivity.
   Only in one site was the null hypothesis upheld, while for the remaining
   six sites, there was evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no
   invasion impact, but direction varied significantly.
   Impact of Parthenium weed invasion on soil processes is context and
   trait-of interest-dependent, and the magnitude and/or direction of the
   weed invasion is affected by complex interactions among environmental
   factors that might change across invaded habitats and survey periods,
   making broad generalizations un-informative for management.}},

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},
Pages = {{9-18}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The effects of grazing exclusion on species diversity and functional
   diversity were analyzed along an elevation gradient from the subalpine
   (1960 m a.s.l) to the lower and upper alpine zone (2275 in-2650 m a.s.l)
   in the Austrian Central Alps for 15 years. Nine sites were chosen,
   including grasslands at different elevations, a bog and a glacier
   foreland site at the lower alpine zone and a snowbed at the upper alpine
   zone. Data were acquired by frequency counts in 1 m(2) permanent plots
   inside each fenced area (three plots per site) and outside in grazed
   areas (three plots), Diversity indices and functional diversity were
   analyzed by means of generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs), Exclosure,
   duration of exclusion and exclosureyears (interaction effect) were
   defined as predictor variables, Multivariate ordination techniques were
   used to (i) determine species responses to grazing exclusion (pRDA,
   partial redundancy analysis) and (ii) to create a distance matrix
   representing the changes between exclosures and control plots per year
   (NMDS, non-metric multidimensional scaling). At the subalpine grassland,
   first differences between exclosure and control plots occurred already
   only after three years, at the upper alpine zone after four and five
   years. Contrary to our expectation, dwarf shrubs did not increase within
   the exclosures of the subalpine grassland. Instead, mainly the tall forb
   Geranium sylvaticuin increased. Species richness significantly decreased
   at the exclosures of the subalpine zone, the snowbed and at one upper
   alpine grassland sites. The communities of the glacier foreland and the
   hog were hardly affected by grazing exclusion.
   We conclude that plant species and communities react individually
   depending on elevation and grazing animals. Grazi exclusion studies at
   high elevations should definitely be carried out in the long-term, (C)

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We combined imagery from multiple sources (MODIS, Landsat-5, 7, 8) with
   land cover data to test for long-term (1984-2015) greening or browning
   trends of vegetation in a temperate alpine area, the Ecrins National
   Park, in the context of recent climate change and domestic grazing
   practices. We showed that over half (56\%) of the Ecrins National Park
   displayed significant increases in peak normalized difference vegetation
   index (NDVImax) over the last 16 years (2000-2015). Importantly, the
   highest proportional increases in NDVImax occurred in rocky habitats at
   high elevations (> 2500 ma.s.l.). While spatial agreement in the
   direction of change in NDVImax as detected by MODIS and Landsat was high
   (76\% overlap), correlations between log-response ratio values were of
   moderate strength (approx. 0.3). In the context of above treeline
   habitats, we found that proportional increases in NDVImax were higher
   between 1984 and 2000 than between 2000 and 2015, suggesting a slowing
   of greening dynamics during the recent decade. The timing of accelerated
   greening prior to 2000 coincided with a pronounced increase in the
   amount of snow-free growing degree-days that occurred during the 1980s
   and 1990s. In the case of grasslands and low-shrub habitats, we did not
   find evidence for a negative effect of grazing on greening trends,
   possibly due to the low grazing intensity typically found in the study
   area. We propose that the emergence of a longer and warmer growing
   season enabled high-elevation plant communities to produce more biomass,
   and also allowed for plant colonization of habitats previously
   characterized by long-lasting snow cover. Increasing plant productivity
   in an alpine context has potential implications for biodiversity
   trajectories and for ecosystem services in mountain landscapes. The
   presented evidence for long-term greening trends in a representative
   region of the European Alps provides the basis for further research on
   mechanisms of greening in alpine landscapes.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Rising temperatures and precipitation are important climate change
   processes around the world. The responses of plants to these trends are
   still unclear in semi-arid regions, especially in areas with degraded
   sandy grassland. To provide insights into the response in these regions,
   we investigated responses of vascular plants to warming and increased
   precipitation in mobile dunes, fixed dunes and grassland, which
   represent the series of sand dune stabilization by plants in semi-arid
   northeastern China. Plant biomass, especially the aboveground biomass,
   varied significantly (P < 0.05) among dune categories. Total plant
   density in the fixed dunes and grassland was 1.9 and 1.7 times that in
   the mobile dunes. Species richness differed slightly but significantly
   (P < 0.05) among the habitats. Increasing precipitation in a drought
   year (65.5\% of the long-term average annual precipitation) by 30\% did
   not significantly affect any plant variable. By contrast, warming
   significantly decreased the belowground biomass, total biomass, species
   richness and plant total density. In summary, in semi-arid region with
   sandy soil, additional precipitation slightly improved plant
   performance, but increased temperature decreased plant performance. Soil
   texture, which determines the balance between moisture retention and
   evaporation, may be a key factor in determining these responses when
   precipitation is unusually low.}},

   plant functional traits}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{249}},
Pages = {{215-225}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Extensive livestock grazing is a global land use activity that has
   numerous social, cultural, and environmental benefits. Many marginal
   zones grazed for centuries are now suffering from abandonment, which has
   been found to be interrelated with species and functional diversity
   loss, and has potential consequences for the provision of ecosystem
   services such as soil fertility and soil carbon storage. We sampled soil
   and plant species abundance in a total of 64 plots (5 x 5 m), in wet and
   dry habitats under different grazing regimes (from moderate grazing to
   grazing abandonment for at least 30 years) in Central Spain. We tested
   the influence of grazing intensity and water availability on different
   variables related to soil fertility and also on soil carbon storage. In
   addition, Community weighted mean and Rao quadratic entropy were
   calculated for two effect traits (specific leaf area and plant height),
   in order to assess the ultimate effects of these functional attributes
   on multifunctionality (i.e., the provision of several simultaneous
   ecosystem functions). We found that grazing abandonment generally
   produces a reduction in soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available
   potassium and phosphorus, aggregate stability and soil carbon storage.
   In addition, grazing abandonment had a negative effect on soil texture
   with loss of fine particles (clay and silt) and water holding capacity,
   but only in dry habitats and in longer-term abandoned situation. In
   general, soil multifunctionality was higher in wet than dry habitats,
   decreased with grazing abandonment in both habitats. Soil
   multifunctionality was indirectly mediated by the functional structure
   of size and leaf traits of the local plant communities, but our results
   suggested that macroscale grazing effects, i.e. translocation of
   nutrients by grazers among habitats via dung and urine deposition, might
   be important mechanisms that influence soil multifunctionality at the
   local level. Agri-environmental policies should be aware of the risk of
   widespread grazing abandonment and take advantage of the benefits of
   low-intensity grazing regimes for ecosystem services such as soil
   fertility and stability, and soil carbon storage.}},

   temperate steppe in northern China}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},

Volume = {{158}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, temperate steppe have become seriously degraded, and
   rest grazing or moderate grazing approaches have been widely adopted
   since 1998 to restore degraded grasslands in northern China. The
   importance of choosing an appropriate grazing management regime for
   optimizing carbon sequestration in light of climate change or promoting
   other multiple ecological benefits of grassland ecosystems to humankind
   have long been recognized. In particular, the various uncertainties in
   plant and soil properties affected by grazing management require
   clarification. In this study, we selected fifteen blocks within three
   kinds of grazing management practices, including free grazing,
   warm-season grazing, and rest grazing, to test the responses of plant
   and soil properties to grazing management. The results showed that the
   species richness, the Shannon-Wiener index, and the proportion of forb
   functional group were higher for the warm-season grazing sites than for
   the free grazing sites. Soil bulk density, pH, the Pielou evenness index
   and the proportion of legume functional groups showed no difference
   among the three kinds of grazing managements. However, aboveground
   biomass, root biomass, canopy cover, and height of the vegetation
   community were larger in the rest grazing sites than in the free grazing
   sites. Soil organic carbon and total nitrogen contents decreased as
   management intensity increased, with the lowest and highest values
   occurring in the free grazing and rest grazing sites, respectively.
   Furthermore, soil organic carbon and total nitrogen contents were
   correlated positively with root biomass. Rest grazing was a suitable
   management strategy for carbon and nitrogen sequestrations, while
   moderate grazing was a suitable management strategy for diversity
   conservation in the temperate steppe, in northern China.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence suggests that past human activities have
   irreversibly changed soil properties and biodiversity patterns. In the
   White Carpathian Mts (Central-Eastern Europe), a mosaic of
   hyper-species-rich and species-rich patches have developed in a
   regularly mown dry grassland in the area of a glassworks abandoned in
   the eighteenth century. We tested whether and how anthropogenically
   changed soils affected the distribution of extraordinary species
   richness. Using magnetometry we detected former furnaces, workspace,
   waste deposit and unaffected surrounding grasslands and compared their
   vegetation and environmental conditions. Archaeological features,
   especially furnaces and waste deposits, showed a higher pH, higher soil
   concentrations of exchangeable phosphorus, manganese, lead and calcium,
   and higher productivity. Surrounding grassland showed higher iron and
   sodium concentrations in the soil, higher N:P ratio in the biomass and
   higher species richness. Moisture was uniformly lower in soils on
   archaeological features, where non-trivially a more `mesic' vegetation
   in terms of European habitat classification occurred. Plant
   compositional variation was best explained by water-extractable
   phosphorus. Because nutrient-richer patches were not moister as common
   elsewhere, and because species richness was only poorly accounted for by
   productivity, the occurrence of a species-poor `mesic' vegetation on
   archaeological features was evidently caused by a long-lasting
   phosphorus oversupply which favours a comparatively small species pool
   of rather recently arriving species. On the contrary, surrounding
   phosphorus-poorer grasslands still contain the ancient species pool
   whose extraordinary size determines the exceptional species richness of
   grasslands in the study region. Its maintenance or restoration demands a
   persistent phosphorus deficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has fragmented rangelands in the Great
   Plains, which has contributed to uniform and homogeneous landscapes and
   decreased biodiversity. Alternative land management practices involving
   fire-grazing interactions can help maintain biodiversity without
   affecting livestock productivity. A survey was designed to understand
   the factors that influence preferences among the general population
   towards grassland landscape heterogeneity. Given the ordinal nature of
   survey responses, requisite data were analyzed using a generalized
   ordinal logit model. Results suggested that respondents who valued open
   space and those who recognized a need for a varying mix of uniform
   grasses and grasslands preferred landscape heterogeneity. Female
   respondents were about two times as likely to prefer heterogeneous
   landscapes compared to male respondents. In contrast, population groups
   that preferred wildlife habitat did not desire heterogeneous landscapes.
   Results suggest the need for extension and outreach activities to
   educate certain segments of the general population regarding benefits of
   alternative management practices that support landscape heterogeneity in
   the Great Plains.}},

Volume = {{23}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Land use for animal production influences the earth system in a variety
   of ways, including local-scale modification to biodiversity, soils, and
   nutrient cycling; regional changes in albedo and hydrology; and
   global-scale changes in greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations.
   Pasture is furthermore the single most extensive form of land cover,
   currently comprising about 22-26\% of the earth's ice-free land surface.
   Despite the importance and variable expressions of animal production,
   distinctions among different systems are effectively absent from studies
   of land use and land cover change. This deficiency is improving;
   however, livestock production system classifications are rarely applied
   in this context, and the most popular global land cover inventories
   still present only a single, usually poorly defined category of
   ``pasture{''} or ``rangeland{''} with no characterization of land use.
   There is a marked lack of bottom-up, evidence-based methodology,
   creating a pressing need to incorporate cross-disciplinary evidence of
   past and present animal production systems into global change studies.
   Here, we present a framework, modified from existing livestock
   production systems, that is rooted in sociocultural, socioeconomic, and
   ecological contexts. The framework defines and characterizes the range
   of land usage pertaining to animal production, and is suitable for
   application in land use inventories and scenarios, land cover modeling,
   and studies on sustainable land use in the past, present, and future.}},

Volume = {{68}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{To protect grasslands and maintain the ecosystem services they provide,
   many European countries have been offering agri-environment measures
   aimed at maintaining extensive grazing by cattle, sheep or goats. Yet,
   despite more than two decades of agri-environment measures, semi-natural
   mountain pastures are still seen as threatened by abandonment and
   subsequent shrub encroachment. Building on a three-round Delphi inquiry,
   we analyse the perception of a range of experts on how measures aimed at
   maintaining mountain grasslands are designed and implemented in Austria,
   France and Norway. Results show that the experts see the need for a
   stronger involvement of diverse regional actors, the need to increase
   the flexibility given to farmers in managing mountain grasslands, and
   the need to reconceptualise monitoring as a social learning process.
   While these approaches are implemented in some `best practice' examples,
   they are not widespread. Understanding these approaches as requiring
   double-loop learning may contribute to explaining their limited spread.
   Indeed, they build on a radically different conceptualization of farmers
   and of researchers, and thus of how agri-environment measures need to be
   designed and implemented tabe effective. Yet, such radical changes are
   likely to be resisted.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},

Volume = {{249}},

Abstract = {{With ongoing biodiversity loss in agricultural landscapes, there is an
   increasing demand to document how farmers preserve and enhance
   biodiversity on their farmland. This subject is not only of interest for
   conservation authorities and NGOs, food companies also look for ways to
   integrate biodiversity issues into their corporate activities. They want
   to know how their farm product suppliers contribute to biodiversity on
   their land. However, species counting and mapping on contracted farms
   seems unrealistic to these companies. Therefore, we aimed to devise
   simple and easy-to-use but scientifically sound parameters to assess the
   biodiversity value of farmlands. For this we focused on estimating the
   value of field margins for butterflies and typical vascular grassland
   plants. We identified 13 parameters that are of likely importance for
   the species numbers of butterflies and 14 parameters likely to be
   important for the species numbers of plants on field margins. These
   parameters were tested on a total of 70 field margins on seven farms
   located throughout Germany. Automatic linear modelling procedures
   selected six parameters as the most important variables in predicting
   butterfly numbers: the landscape heterogeneity of the surroundings, the
   time of mowing, the width and length of the margin, the grass-herb-ratio
   and the management of the adjacent field. For predicting plant species
   numbers, the automatic linear modelling procedures again selected six
   parameters as best predictors: the length of the margin, the presence of
   trees and/or shrubs, the amount of source habitats in the surroundings,
   the width of the margin, the nutrient availability and the landscape
   heterogeneity of the surroundings. The adapted final model for butterfly
   species numbers explained 63\% of the variation. The adapted final model
   for typical vascular grassland plant species numbers, which excluded the
   margin width variable as it did not prove stable in cross-validation
   procedures, explained 67\% of the variation in plant species numbers.
   Both models can be used by farmers and food companies alike to rapidly
   assess the present value of field margins for butterflies and plants on
   their (contracted) farms and to identity potential and appropriate
   measures to enhance biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Bioenergy production on marginal land in Canada: Potential, economic

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{205}},
Pages = {{477-485}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Growing energy crops such as perennial grasses and trees on marginal
   land offers the possibility of reducing the competition with food crops
   for land resources. Identifying the productivity, economic feasibility
   and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impact is the premise of our study on
   using marginal land for bioenergy production in Canada. The area of
   marginal land available was identified by intersecting national maps of
   land suitability and land cover. The costs and potential returns of
   growing energy crops on marginal land were then analyzed, and the GHG
   emissions were evaluated using a GHG emissions model. The results
   indicated that approximately 9.48 million ha of potentially useable
   marginal land was available in Canada. The land cover of the available
   marginal land consists of grassland (68.2\%) and shrubland (31.8\%). If
   the available marginal land was completely utilized, the biomass
   production would be 23.7 million tonnes of switchgrass or 51.2 million
   tonnes of hybrid poplar. The production of biofuel from these biomass
   sources would be 5.69 and 11.26 billion L, equivalent to 14.0\% and
   27.7\% of the total transportation gasoline consumption in Canada in
   2014, for switchgrass and poplar, respectively. On the marginal land,
   the average production cost was estimated to be approximately 68.2 CAD
   \$/t (173.8 CAD \$/ha) for switchgrass, and 26.2 CAD \$/t (140.2 CAD
   \$/ha) for coppiced hybrid poplar. The production of biomass showed a
   positive net return on marginal land in Ontario (eastern Canada), with a
   biomass price of 99 CAD \$/t and 35 CAD \$/t for switchgrass and
   coppiced hybrid poplar, respectively. When the biomass price is less
   than 101 CAD \$/t, growing switchgrass in the provinces of Alberta and
   Saskatchewan, where 69\% of Canada's marginal land is located, was not
   considered economically attractive. By replacing fossil fuel, the
   maximum potential switchgrass production on marginal land would reduce
   GHG emissions by 29.49 million t CO2-eq/yr. However, when considering
   the economic aspect of production, the potential reduction of 6.1
   million tonnes CO2/yr from planting poplar is more viable. Further
   analysis of the broader economic value of the current use of marginal
   land (primarily livestock grazing) and the impacts on biodiversity, soil
   quality, and water resources is needed to completely assess the
   practicality of a widespread increase in biomass production for
   bioenergy on Canada's marginal land.}},

   taxonomic groups due to intensification of agricultural practices.
   Establishment and appropriate management of arable field margins can
   improve the diversity and abundance of invertebrate groups; however,
   there is much less research on field margins within grassland systems.
   Three grassland field margin treatments (fencing off the existing
   vegetation fenced; fencing with rotavation and natural regeneration
   rotavated and; fencing with rotavation and seeding seeded) were compared
   to a grazed control in the adjacent intensively managed pasture.
   Invertebrates were sampled using emergence traps to investigate species
   breeding and overwintering within the margins. Using a manipulation
   experiment, we tested whether the removal of grazing pressure and
   nutrient inputs would increase the abundance and richness of breeding
   invertebrates within grassland field margins. We also tested whether
   field margin establishment treatments, with their different vegetation
   communities, would change the abundance and richness of breeding
   invertebrates in the field margins. Exclusion of grazing and nutrient
   inputs led to increased abundance and richness in nearly all
   invertebrate groups that we sampled. However, there were more complex
   effects of field margin establishment treatment on the abundance and
   richness of invertebrate taxa. Each of the three establishment
   treatments supported a distinct invertebrate community. The removal of
   grazing from grassland field margins provided a greater range of
   overwintering/breeding habitat for invertebrates. We demonstrate the
   capacity of field margin establishment to increase the abundance and
   richness in nearly all invertebrate groups in study plots that were
   located on previously more depauperate areas of intensively managed
   grassland. These results from grassland field margins provide evidence
   to support practical actions that can inform Greening (Pillar 1) and
   agri-environment measures (Pillar 2) of the Common Agricultural Policy
   (CAP). Before implementing specific management regimes, the conservation
   aims of agri-environment measures should be clarified by defining the
   target species or taxonomic groups.}},

Abstract = {{Genomic data for less than one quarter of similar to 1.8 million named
   species on earth exist in public databases like GenBank. Little
   information exists on the estimated one million small sized (1-100 mu m)
   heterotrophic nanoflagellates and ciliates and their taxa-area
   relationship. We analyzed environmental DNA from 150 geo-referenced
   grassland plots representing topographical and land-use ranges typical
   for Central Europe. High through-put barcoding allowed the
   identification of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at species level,
   with high pairwise identity to reference sequences (>= 99.7\%), but also
   the identification of sequences at the genus (>= 97\%) and class (>=
   80\%) taxonomic level. Species richness analyses revealed, on average,
   100 genus level OTUs (332 unique individual read (UIR) and 56 class
   level OTUs per gram of soil sample in the mesoscale (1-1 000 km).
   Database shortfalls were highlighted by increased uncertain taxonomic
   lineages at lower resolution (>= 80\% sequence identity). No single
   barcode occurred ubiquitously across all sites. Taxa-area relationships
   indicated that OTUs spread over the entire mesoscale were more similar
   than in the local scale and increased land-use (fertilization, mowing
   and grazing) promoted taxa-area separation. Only a small fraction of
   sequences strictly matched reference library sequences, suggesting a
   large protistan ``dark matter{''} in soil which warrants further
   research. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Novel fine-scale aerial mapping approach quantifies grassland weed cover
   dynamics and response to management}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Invasive weeds threaten the biodiversity and forage productivity of
   grasslands worldwide. However, management of these weeds is constrained
   by the practical difficulty of detecting small-scale infestations across
   large landscapes and by limits in understanding of landscape- scale
   invasion dynamics, including mechanisms that enable patches to expand,
   contract, or remain stable. While high-end hyperspectral remote sensing
   systems can effectively map vegetation cover, these systems are
   currently too costly and limited in availability for most land managers.
   We demonstrate application of a more accessible and cost-effective
   remote sensing approach, based on simple aerial imagery, for quantifying
   weed cover dynamics over time. In California annual grasslands, the
   target communities of interest include invasive weedy grasses (Aegilops
   triuncialis and Elymus caput-medusae) and desirable forage grass species
   (primarily Avena spp. and Bromus spp.). Detecting invasion of annual
   grasses into an annual-dominated community is particularly challenging,
   but we were able to consistently characterize these two communities
   based on their phenological differences in peak growth and senescence
   using maximum likelihood supervised classification of imagery acquired
   twice per year (in mid-and end-of season). This approach permitted us to
   map weed-dominated cover at a 1-m scale (correctly detecting 93\% of
   weed patches across the landscape) and to evaluate weed cover change
   over time. We found that weed cover was more pervasive and persistent in
   management units that had no significant grazing for several years than
   in those that were grazed, whereas forage cover was more abundant and
   stable in the grazed units. This application demonstrates the power of
   this method for assessing fine-scale vegetation transitions across
   heterogeneous landscapes. It thus provides means for small-scale early
   detection of invasive species and for testing fundamental questions
   about landscape dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Grazers may increase grassland plant species diversity through
   mechanisms such as selective consumption of graminoids resulting in
   release from competition in subordinate forb species, or the enhancement
   of small-scale habitat heterogeneity. This study tested the hypothesis
   bison on tallgrass prairie reduce local plant competition and increase
   the growth, reproduction, abundance, and diversity of forbs. In
   addition, because grazers, fire, and other drivers result in high
   spatio-temporal variation in limiting plant resources in tallgrass
   prairie, we tested the hypothesis that prairie forbs show high
   phenotypic plasticity in life history traits in response to large
   grazers.
   The growth, reproduction, biomass allocation, and abundances of six
   common perennial forb species, and estimates of local neighborhood and
   physical environmental factors were compared in replicate tallgrass
   prairie sites with and without bison. Greater light availability and
   percent bare ground; and lower grass canopy density, height, and cover
   in habitats with bison indicated reduced aboveground plant competition
   in sites with large grazers. The activities of bison resulted in higher
   growth and reproduction for all six forb species studied and higher forb
   species richness. Habitats with bison were also characterized by much
   higher seed reproduction but no differences in vegetative reproduction
   compared to habitats without large grazers. Patterns of biomass
   allocation also showed high plasticity in these species, with reduced
   allocation to stem and increased allocation to reproduction in habitats
   with bison. The results of this study provide evidence the activities of
   bison reduce grass-forb competition, and that release from aboveground
   competition with grasses increases the growth, seed reproduction,
   abundance, and ultimately the diversity of perennial forb species in
   tallgrass prairie. The results further indicate perennial forbs in
   tallgrass prairie show high phenotypic plasticity in life history traits
   such as growth, reproduction, and resource allocation patterns.}},

   network architecture}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{At the local scale, insect herbivore diversity is often limited by plant
   diversity, but little is known about how the network structure of plant
   and herbivore interactions changes across local plant diversity
   gradients. Ascertaining plant-herbivore interaction structure at the
   ecological community level is important for predicting responses of
   herbivores to plant species loss. We sampled arthropods and plants
   across three years, beginning in the fourth year of an experimental
   prairie restoration containing three treatment levels of sown plant
   diversity. Plots initially planted with higher plant diversity had
   higher arthropod species richness. Sown diversity treatments strongly
   affected plant-herbivore interaction structure: The increased sown
   diversity treatment decreased plant-herbivore connectance, increased
   average herbivore diet generalism, and increased herbivore robustness to
   plant species loss. Treatments diverged over time with the last year of
   sampling showing the greatest difference between treatments in plant and
   arthropod species richness, and plant-herbivore network structural
   properties. Network structural properties of the high sown diversity
   treatment were the least variable temporally. However, divergence of
   plant and arthropod between diversity treatments was not found in
   traditional ordinations of community taxonomic composition. While
   previous comparisons of plant-herbivore interaction networks across
   ecological gradients treated network size (biodiversity) as a
   confounding factor, we demonstrate that plant diversity can directly
   shape network structure, and higher plant diversity maintains less
   temporally variable ecological networks of herbivores and their host
   plants.}},

Abstract = {{Land use change is the main driving force of global environmental change
   and is considered as very central to the ongoing debate on sustainable
   development. Even though large volume of literature materials is
   available of land use/land cover (LU/LC) change for many areas, very
   little is known of it in the floodplain of the Sokoto Rima River Basin
   of Nigeria despite the basin's strategic importance. Thus, this study
   characterized the basin's LU/LC and its change using computer-based
   digital classification of near-anniversary Landsat 5 TM imagery of
   November 23, 1998, and Landsat 8 OLI of December 2, 2013. The results of
   the digital classification were complimented with field-based
   observations on major observable characteristics of every LU/LC
   identified. Thirteen classes (forest area, dense grassland, grassy
   fallow, grazed open grassland, open cultivation, open grain fallow
   farmland, pepper cultivation, rice farmland, scrubland, sugarcane
   farmland, dry bare land, sand deposit and wetland/water) were
   characterized and the nature and extent of their changes assessed. 40 \%
   of the basin's uses is under cultivation, 22 \% is under fallow, 27 \%
   is either degraded or non-cultivable, while 11 \% is forested. Change
   events include forest loss, increase in area cultivated, expansion of
   shrub/scrubland and pervasiveness of grazing. The changes were more
   pronounced in the upper than either the central and southern segments of
   the basin. In general LU/LC changes in the basin are reflection of
   increased human population pressure and effects of climate change. The
   LU/LC patterns and changes suggest underutilization and mismanagement of
   the floodplain which have impact on soil, hydrology and biodiversity
   with serious implication for livelihood and food security. The study
   recommends that interventions are needed to promote enhanced and
   sustainable management of land, water and vegetation resources in the
   basin, with particular emphasis on empowering the local land users to
   participate actively toward sustainable management of the floodplain.}},

   large sheep landrace, is equally as well-suited for the maintenance of
   extensively farmed fen grassland as the smaller, hardy Skudde breed of
   sheep. For each breed, two flocks with 10 ewes and their lambs were
   included in a 3-year grazing trial on long-standing, extensively used
   fen grassland paddocks. Our study revealed no major differences between
   Skudde and Bentheimer Landschaf regarding feed preference,
   endozoochorous dispersal potential and reproductive performance. The
   food intake of both breeds was not only limited to high-quality forage
   grasses, they also chose more crude fiber-rich plant species. Reed
   canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea L.) was preferably selected. A
   relevant problem under set stocking conditions with alternate hay
   cutting was the spread of creeping thistle (Cirsium arvense (L.) Scop.)
   on the paddocks of both sheep breeds. The majority of the germinable
   seeds found in fecal samples were contributed by the small-seeded grass
   species Poa trivialis L. and Agrostis stolonifera L., which were the
   most abundant in the vegetation of the paddocks. Juncus spp. seeds were
   found at above-average levels in the fecal samples compared with the
   vegetation percentages of these species. Among the weed species, only
   stinging nettle (Urtica dioica L.) showed a higher endozoochorous
   dispersal potential. The greater slaughter weight of Bentheimer
   Landschaf lambs has a positive effect on the efficiency of sheep
   farming. Considering all of the studied characteristics, we concluded
   that large landrace Bentheimer Landschaf sheep as well as Skudde sheep
   may be only recommended for the maintenance of drained fen grassland if
   additional control strategies against the spread of thistles accompany
   grazing management.}},

Abstract = {{An 8-ha, extremely rich fen, surrounded by saline wet meadows, occurs on
   the western edge of mixed-grass prairie in the northwestern Great
   Plains, 47 km east of the Montana Rocky Mountain Front. The site occurs
   on an outwash plain near the junction of Pleistocene-age continental and
   mountain glaciers and on the western edge of former glacial Cut Bank
   Lake. Five wetland plant communities are described from this site. A
   total of 93 vascular plant and 65 diatom species have been found. Twelve
   diatom taxa could not be identified with available floras and one has
   been confirmed as new to science. Both diatoms and vascular plants
   indicate a locally disjunct, post-glacial assemblage similar to those
   found in boreal and mountainous habitats, adapted to alkaline waters.
   Saline-influenced, extremely rich fens are a rare sub-type of peatland
   in the northern Great Plains, and contain high diatom and vascular plant
   species richness as well as rare taxa.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsHow does ground-layer plant composition respond to the
   imposition of woodland habitat restoration treatments following the
   removal of long-term pastoral management? Do different vegetation types
   have different trajectories of change?
   LocationA long-term ecological research site comprising temperate
   eucalypt grassy woodland and forest in south-eastern Australia,
   converted from pastoral use to conservation management. This has
   involved the implementation of habitat restoration treatments in
   addition to the cessation of livestock grazing and fertilizer inputs.
   MethodsWe surveyed ground-layer floristic composition over a 4-yr
   interval, in 96 1-ha sites that had been subjected to combinations of
   restoration treatments aimed at improving the condition of the woodland
   habitat for fauna: (1) Reduced kangaroo grazing intensity; (2) Addition
   of coarse woody debris; and (3) Burning. We used nonmetric
   multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to plot the sites, and to analyse the
   average trajectories of floristic change for each of six initially
   identified vegetation types, and the restoration treatments. We
   partitioned Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures to rank individual
   species' contributions to floristic change in each vegetation type
   between 2007 and 2011.
   ResultsThe identities of the six vegetation types identified at time
   zero was strongly retained over the 4-yr observation period. There was
   generally a uniform change across the vegetation types, which was the
   result of increases in biomass of the characteristic dominant perennial
   grasses, and increases in some native forbs. The two vegetation types
   with evidence of past fertilization showed some convergence with native
   vegetation types due to the decrease in some exotic species. The
   restoration treatments had no significant influence on species
   composition.
   ConclusionsThe native herbaceous vegetation in the woodland was largely
   resistant to compositional change, although seasonal conditions
   increased the biomass of the perennial grasses defining the different
   vegetation types. However, sites with an evident history of past
   fertilization and notable amounts of exotic pasture species changed
   slightly but significantly, with some pasture species declining and
   floristic convergence with native vegetation over 4yr. These rates of
   change need to be considered in the application of vegetation offsetting
   policy.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionWhat are the effects of cutting, glyphosate application and
   steam application on abundance and diversity of non-native grasses and
   forbs and non-target native grasses and forbs in restoration of a
   complex disturbed fescue grassland?
   LocationWaterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, Canada.
   MethodsCutting, glyphosate application and steam application treatments
   were implemented at three disturbed sites in an incomplete block design
   with a control. Plant communities were evaluated for four growing
   seasons, one before and three after management treatment implementation.
   ResultsGlyphosate reduced non-native grass cover for three growing
   seasons following application and non-native forbs for one growing
   season. Glyphosate led to significant increases in non-native forb
   cover, more than double pre-existing values 2 and 3yr after application.
   Native species abundance and diversity were more negatively impacted by
   glyphosate on sites with higher abundance and diversity prior to
   management treatments. Low frequency cutting over 2yr did not
   consistently control non-native species, steam reduced non-native grass
   cover at the most heavily invaded site.
   ConclusionsSite-specific conditions must be considered to develop
   effective control methods for non-native species. No treatment
   effectively re-established native grassland communities. Glyphosate
   application reduced non-native grasses, but not non-native forbs. When
   native forbs were abundant prior to management, glyphosate reduced them.
   Steam may have potential and should be further investigated. This is one
   of only a few studies to investigate methods to manage multiple
   non-native species occurring with native species, rather than management
   of a single undesirable species, and is the first to assess steam as a
   management option for native grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionTo what extent does winter supplementary feeding influence
   vegetation and soil seed banks in forest ecosystems?
   LocationBiaowiea Primaeval Forest, NE Poland.
   MethodsSeveral dozen feeding stations, each composed of one to several
   haystacks, are used in Biaowiea Forest for supplementary winter feeding
   of European bison (Bison bonasus). We checked the species composition
   and availability of seeds in hay in 15 haystacks of the eight oldest
   feeding stations, which could be a potential source of seeds. Vegetation
   and soil seed bank were sampled on the overlapping 10mx10m plots
   distributed along 500-m long transects running south and north of the
   studied feeding stations. Seed content in the soil samples was studied
   by the seedling emergence method in an unheated greenhouse.
   ResultsWe revealed high dissimilarity of species composition of the
   hayseed, soil seed bank and standing vegetation. The dissimilarity
   between soil seed banks and standing vegetation increased with the
   distance from the haystack. The species richness of the standing
   vegetation was not affected by distance to the haystack, while seed bank
   species richness showed a significant negative correlation with
   distance. The mean weighted ecological indicator values of pH, light and
   soil fertility were negatively correlated with the distance from the
   haystack for the seed bank and the standing vegetation. The percentage
   of damaged bushes and juvenile trees was positively correlated with
   their density and decreased with the distance from the haystack.
   ConclusionsWe revealed distinct but local (25-50m off the haystack)
   effect of supplementary feeding on the vegetation and soil seed banks of
   forest ecosystems. Taking into account the ecosystem approach to nature
   conservation, the winter feeding in forest ecosystems should be
   concentrated in few places to avoid the expansion of non-native plant
   species in forest ecosystems. To prevent potential plant invasions, the
   origin of the hay used as supplementary winter fodder should be
   carefully selected, with a preference for local origin and making of hay
   of native plant species in the forest's meadows or in its surroundings.}},

Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{2561-2573}},

Abstract = {{The nearly universal positive relationship between the distribution and
   abundance of species has been explained by several hypotheses but
   hitherto no consensus has been reached. Here, we used monitoring data of
   105 phytophagous true bug species (Heteroptera) from 150 grassland sites
   over six years to test how (1) range position, (2) resource use, (3)
   resource availability, (4) density-dependent habitat selection, (5)
   metapopulation dynamics, and (6) habitat dispersal affect the
   distribution-abundance relationship. For the use in a confirmatory path
   analysis, we constructed causal pathways representing the hypothesized
   relationships and tested them separately and in a combined analysis. Our
   results show that the distribution-abundance relationship in
   phytophagous true bugs is driven by habitat-availability. An increasing
   local density of the host-plants increases the distribution of the
   species in the landscape, which in turn increases their local abundance.
   Thereby habitat availability facilitates dispersal success. We conclude
   that local abundance of herbivores facing habitat destruction could
   decline owing to a decrease in population dynamics between sites at the
   landscape scale. Finally, our results underline the potential of
   confirmatory path analysis for testing competing hypotheses.}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{19}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Livestock grazing affects over 60\% of the world's agricultural lands
   and can influence rangeland ecosystem services and the quantity and
   quality of wildlife habitat, resulting in changes in biodiversity.
   Concomitantly, livestock grazing has the potential to be detrimental to
   some wildlife species while benefiting other rangeland organisms. Many
   imperiled grouse species require rangeland landscapes that exhibit
   diverse vegetation structure and composition to complete their life
   cycle. However, because of declining populations and reduced
   distributions, grouse are increasingly becoming a worldwide conservation
   concern. Grouse, as a suite of upland gamebirds, are often considered an
   umbrella species for other wildlife and thus used as indicators of
   rangeland health. With a projected increase in demand for livestock
   products, better information will be required to mitigate the
   anthropogenic effects of livestock grazing on rangeland biodiversity. To
   address this need, we completed a data-driven and systematic review of
   the peer-reviewed literature to determine the current knowledge of the
   effects of livestock grazing on grouse populations (i.e., chick
   production and population indices) worldwide. Our meta-analysis revealed
   an overall negative effect of livestock grazing on grouse populations.
   Perhaps more importantly, we identified an information void regarding
   the effects of livestock grazing on the majority of grouse species.
   Additionally, the reported indirect effects of livestock grazing on
   grouse species were inconclusive and more reflective of differences in
   the experimental design of the available studies. Future studies
   designed to evaluate the direct and indirect effects of livestock
   grazing on wildlife should document (i) livestock type, (ii) timing and
   frequency of grazing, (iii) duration, and (iv) stocking rate. Much of
   this information was lacking in the available published studies we
   reviewed, but is essential when making comparisons between different
   livestock grazing management practices and their potential impacts on
   rangeland biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Pollination is a key ecosystem service, and appropriate management,
   particularly in agricultural systems, is essential to maintain a
   diversity of pollinator guilds. However, management recommendations
   frequently focus on maintaining plant communities, with the assumption
   that associated invertebrate populations will be sustained. We tested
   whether plant community, flower resources, and soil moisture would
   influence hoverfly (Syrphidae) abundance and species richness in
   floristically-rich seminatural and floristically impoverished
   agricultural grassland communities in Wales (U.K.) and compared these to
   two Hymenoptera genera, Bombus, and Lasioglossum. Interactions between
   environmental variables were tested using generalized linear modeling,
   and hoverfly community composition examined using canonical
   correspondence analysis. There was no difference in hoverfly abundance,
   species richness, or bee abundance, between grassland types. There was a
   positive association between hoverfly abundance, species richness, and
   flower abundance in unimproved grasslands. However, this was not evident
   in agriculturally improved grassland, possibly reflecting intrinsically
   low flower resource in these habitats, or the presence of plant species
   with low or relatively inaccessible nectar resources. There was no
   association between soil moisture content and hoverfly abundance or
   species richness. Hoverfly community composition was influenced by
   agricultural improvement and the amount of flower resource. Hoverfly
   species with semiaquatic larvae were associated with both seminatural
   and agricultural wet grasslands, possibly because of localized larval
   habitat. Despite the absence of differences in hoverfly abundance and
   species richness, distinct hoverfly communities are associated with
   marshy grasslands, agriculturally improved marshy grasslands, and
   unimproved dry grasslands, but not with improved dry grasslands.
   Grassland plant community cannot be used as a proxy for pollinator
   community. Management of grasslands should aim to maximize the
   pollinator feeding resource, as well as maintain plant communities.
   Retaining waterlogged ground may enhance the number of hoverflies with
   semiaquatic larvae.}},

Title = {{Effects of grassland management on plant C:N:P stoichiometry:
   implications for soil element cycling and storage}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The functioning of human-managed grassland ecosystems strongly depends
   on how common management practices (e.g., animal grazing and the chronic
   addition of fertilizing materials to soils) interact to influence plant
   and soil element stoichiometry. Here we use data from a 22-yr-long
   grassland experiment to address whether and how plant element
   stoichiometry (i.e., carbon {[}C], nitrogen {[}N], phosphorus {[}P]
   ratios) might respond to (1) animal grazing, (2) agricultural liming
   (i.e., CaCO3) applications, and (3) nutrient fertilization. We also ask
   whether plant C:N:P stoichiometry could predict changes in soil N and P
   availability and in soil C, N, and P stocks. We found that grassland
   management significantly affected plant C:N:P ratios as predicted by
   ecological stoichiometry theory. For example, plant aboveground and
   belowground C:N and C:P ratios decreased under chronic N and P
   fertilization, respectively. Plant C:N and C:P ratios were significantly
   greater in unfertilized (control) soils. Also plant C:N ratios were
   highest under P-only additions, whereas plant C:P ratios were highest
   under N-only additions. However, unpredictable changes in C:N:P ratios
   also occurred, suggesting that plant tissue chemistry may not be a
   simple reflection of soil nutrient availability. Changes in plant
   C:nutrient ratios well predicted variation in soil nutrient
   availability, but not in soil C, N, and P stocks. Contrary to
   expectations, soil C stocks significantly increased with decreasing
   plant C:N ratios in the nutrient-fertilized grasslands and not with
   increasing plant C:N ratios in the unfertilized grasslands. We suggest
   that a better mechanistic understanding of the negative relationship
   between plant C:N stoichiometry and soil C accrual will greatly help in
   improving the sustainability of human-managed grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Reactive nitrogen (N) deposition from intensive agricultural and
   industrial activity has been identified as the third greatest threat to
   global terrestrial biodiversity, after land-use and climate change.
   While the impacts of N deposition are widely acknowledged, their

   response functions, and vegetation mapping to simulate the effects of
   Ndeposition on plant species richness from 1900 to 2030, using the
   island of Great Britain as a case study. We find that current species
   richness values - when averaged across five widespread habitat types -
   are approximately one-third less than without N deposition. Our results
   suggest that currently expected reductions in emissions will achieve no
   more than modest increases in species richness by 2030, and that
   emissions cuts based on habitat-specific ``critical loads{''} may be an
   inefficient approach to managing Ndeposition for the protection of plant
   biodiversity. The effects of N deposition on biodiversity are severe and

Title = {{Livestock grazing alters multiple ecosystem properties and services in
   salt marshes: a meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{54}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. The far-reaching impacts of livestock grazing in terrestrial
   grasslands are widely appreciated, but how livestock affect the
   structure and functions of sensitive coastal ecosystems has hitherto
   lacked synthesis. Grazing-induced changes in salt marshes have the
   potential to alter the provision of valuable ecosystem services, such as
   coastal protection, blue carbon and biodiversity conservation.
   2. To investigate how livestock alter soil, vegetation and faunal
   properties in salt marshes, we conducted a global meta-analysis of
   ungulate grazer impacts on commonly measured ecosystem properties (498
   individual responses from 89 studies). We also tested stocking density,
   grazing duration, grazer identity, continent and vegetation type as
   potential modifiers of the grazing effect. The majority of studies were
   conducted in Europe (75) or the Americas (12), and investigated cattle
   (43) or sheep (22) grazing.
   3. All measures of above-ground plant material (height, cover,
   above-ground biomass, litter) were decreased by grazing, potentially
   impairing coastal protection through diminished wave attenuation.
   4. Soil carbon was reduced by grazing in American, but not European
   marshes, indicating a trade-off with climate regulation that varies
   geographically. Additionally, grazing increased soil bulk density,
   salinity and daytime temperature, and reduced redox potential.
   5. Biodiversity responses depended on focal group, with positive effects
   of grazing on vegetation species richness, but negative effects on
   invertebrate richness. Grazing reduced the abundance of herbivorous
   invertebrates, which may affect fish and crustaceans that feed in the
   marsh. Overall vertebrate abundance was not affected, but there was
   provisional evidence for increases over a longer duration of grazing,
   potentially increasing birdwatching and wildfowling opportunities.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that the use of salt
   marshes for livestock production affects multiple ecosystem properties,
   creating trade-offs and synergies with other ecosystem services. Grazing
   leads to reductions in blue carbon in the Americas but not in Europe.
   Grazing may compromise coastal protection and the provision of a nursery
   habitat for fish while creating provisioning and cultural benefits
   through increased wildfowl abundance. These findings can inform salt
   marsh grazing management, based on local context and desired ecosystem
   services.}},

Title = {{Suppressing competitive dominants and community restoration with native
   parasitic plants using the hemiparasitic Rhinanthus alectorolophus and
   the dominant grass Calamagrostis epigejos}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. Dominance of native or alien competitive plants causes competitive
   exclusion of subordinate species and represents a major mechanism
   reducing biodiversity following land-use changes. The successful
   competitive strategies may, however, be interfered with by parasitic
   plants, which withdraw resources from other plants' vasculature.
   Parasitism may strongly reduce the growth of the dominants, which may
   facilitate regeneration of other species and consequently trigger
   restoration of natural communities of high diversity.
   2. Here, we aim to provide robust empirical evidence demonstrating this
   restoration potential of parasitic plants. We present a case study
   testing suppressive effects of hemiparasitic Rhinanthus alectorolophus
   on competitive grass Calamagrostis epigejos. In recent decades, C.
   epigejos has invaded many high-nature-value semi-natural grasslands of
   Central Europe, which is one of the prominent factors causing their
   biodiversity decline.
   3. We conducted three manipulative field experiments testing the effect
   of sowing of R. alectorolophus in different vegetation types infested by
   C. epigejos. Rhinanthus sowing was compared to different mowing
   treatments recommended as the `best practice' management at respective
   sites.
   4. Rhinanthus alectorolophus established itself in most C.
   epigejos-dominated plots where sown. Calamagrostis epigejos was
   virtually exterminated in 2 years in two of the experiments (dry meadow
   and industrial area). In the wet-meadow experiment, the suppressive
   effect was variable as a result of uneven establishment success of
   Rhinanthus. In this experiment increased mowing intensity had an
   additional suppressive effect on C. epigejos. Rhinanthus also increased
   regeneration potential of other species by a temporary reduction of
   vegetation density. Restoration of target vegetation composition was,
   however, dependent on community context.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrated that hemiparasitic
   Rhinanthus alectorolophus is an accessible and efficient tool for
   targeted biological control of Calamagrostis epigejos, with a great
   potential to restore infested grassland vegetation. The strong effect of
   Rhinanthus is caused by interference with the underground storage and
   clonal growth strategy of Calamagrostis epigejos, which are both traits
   that underlie its competitive ability. The potential of native parasitic
   plants should be considered in restoration management of sites infested
   by competitive dominants, either alien or native.}},

Abstract = {{Context Abandonment of extensively managed meadows is an ongoing global
   challenge in recent decades, particularly in mountain regions, and
   directly affects plant diversity. However, the extent to which plant
   diversity further affects associated insect pollinators or herbivores is
   little investigated.
   Objectives We focused on the effects of abandonment of mountain meadows
   on species richness and assemblages of bumblebees, bugs and
   grasshoppers. Specifically, we investigated the influence of vegetation
   cover, flower cover, plant richness and surrounding landscape on the
   three insect groups.
   Methods Species richness, abundance and species assemblages of
   bumblebees, bugs and grasshoppers were surveyed in one Swiss and two
   Austrian regions: three meadows which had been abandoned for 15-60
   years, and three extensively managed meadows (mown once a year, no use
   of fertilizers). We surveyed bumblebees and bugs by sweep net, and
   grasshoppers using the time-effective soundscape approach.
   Results Bumblebee species richness and abundance were significantly
   higher in managed meadows, whereas bug and grasshopper richness and
   abundance showed no differences between both management types. Managed
   and abandoned meadows harboured significantly different species
   assemblages of bugs and grasshoppers, but not of bumblebees. Increasing
   flower cover and plant richness increased bumblebee richness, but
   correlated negatively with richness of bugs. Surrounding open landscape
   positively affected bugs. Caelifera positively correlated with
   surrounding forest cover and negatively with vegetation cover.
   Vegetation cover positively affected Ensifera.
   Conclusions Abandoned and extensively managed meadows are important
   habitat types for the conservation of the three insect groups, thus
   suggesting the maintenance of both habitat types within mountain
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Context Intensification of land use is known as a major driver of
   worldwide decline in biodiversity. Trophic interactions might be
   especially affected by a changing landscape structure due to
   agricultural intensification.
   Objectives In this study we investigated the effects of increasing land
   use intensity on a tritrophic system at different spatial scales in a
   landscape context.
   Methods We examined two weevil species, Mecinus labilis Herbst and M.
   pascuorum Gyllenhal, as well as their common parasitoid, Mesopolobus
   incultus Walker, living on a common native herb, the ribwort plantain
   (Plantago lanceolata L.), at 76 sites in three geographic regions in
   Germany. The effect of land use intensity on species abundances was
   analysed across a range of spatial scales (100-2000 m) around the study
   sites.
   Results In all three regions and across most spatial scales, an
   increasing proportion of intensively managed grasslands in the
   surrounding landscape directly negatively influenced herbivore
   abundance. An increasing proportion of semi-natural habitats had a
   direct positive influence on herbivore abundance. The abundance of M.
   labilis was best explained at radii of r = 1500-2000 m, that of M.
   pascuorum at r = 100-500 m. The parasitoid, M. incultus, was indirectly
   influenced by land use intensity via the density of its two hosts.
   Conclusions Agricultural intensification of grasslands can profoundly
   affect the abundance of their herbivorous and entomophagous fauna at
   landscape scale. This may have important implications for landscape
   management and the conservation of higher trophic level organisms in
   agricultural landscapes.}},

   study on spiders from Transylvania}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{The integration of food production and biodiversity conservation
   represents a key challenge for sustainability. Several studies suggest
   that even small structural elements in the landscape can make a
   substantial contribution to the overall biodiversity value of the
   agricultural landscapes. Pastures can have high biodiversity potential.
   However, their intensive and monofunctional use typically erodes its
   natural capital, including biodiversity. Here we address the ecological
   value of fine scale structural elements represented by sparsely
   scattered trees and shrubs for the spider communities in a moderately
   intensively grazed pasture in Transylvania, Eastern Europe. The pasture
   was grazed with sheep, cattle and buffalo (ca 1 Livestock Unit ha(-1))
   and no chemical fertilizers were applied. Sampling sites covered the
   open pasture as well as the existing fine-scale heterogeneity created by
   scattered trees and shrub. 40 sampling locations each being represented
   by three 1 m(2) quadrats were situated in a stratified design while
   assuring spatial independency of sampling locations. We identified 140
   species of spiders, out of which 18 were red listed and four were new
   for the Romanian fauna. Spider species assemblages of open pasture,
   scattered trees, trees and shrubs and the forest edge were statistically
   distinct. Our study shows that sparsely scattered mature woody
   vegetation and shrubs substantially increases the ecological value of
   managed pastures. The structural complexity provided by scattered trees
   and shrubs makes possible the co-occurrence of high spider diversity
   with a moderately high intensity grazing possible in this wood-pasture.
   Our results are in line with recent empirical research showing that
   sparse trees and shrubs increases the biodiversity potential of pastures
   managed for commodity production.}},

Journal = {{RESOURCES-BASEL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The Lake Chad Basin has for a very long period supported the livelihoods
   of millions of peoples from the different countries that share this
   transboundary water resource. Its shrinking over the decades has meant
   that many of those who depend on it for livelihoods would have to adjust
   to the changing resource environment of this lake basin. This study sets
   out to examine the seasonal migration of people in search of water,
   pasture, fuelwood and cultivable land, and how this movement affects
   access and use of basin resources. The study made use of survey data
   obtained from 220 household heads on the Cameroon side of the Lake Chad
   basin, and secondary data from Cameroon ministries in charge of
   agriculture, the environment, and that of livestock. Our findings show
   that while fishing and livestock rearing continue to feature among the
   oldest determinants of population movements in the Lake Chad basin,
   increasingly the search for new farming opportunities made available by
   a shrinking lake and the political instability emanating from Nigeria
   are also becoming an important determinant. The increasing population in
   the lake region is compounding pressures created by a shrinking lake on
   access to water, fuelwood, pasture, and farmland. While there is
   potential to develop and benefit from the agricultural possibilities
   emerging from a shrinking lake, the impacts of poor agricultural
   resource management (especially land degradation, loss of agricultural
   biodiversity, and poor water management) may hamper the sustainable
   practice of agriculture if proper efforts are not made to address them.
   This study contributes to the scientific understanding of the changing
   nature of environmental resources in Africa. It specifically contributes
   to understanding the exacerbating threats to the sustainability of
   natural resources (water, agricultural and grazing land) caused by
   environmental changes, diversification of rural actors (fishers,
   farmers, breeders), weak resource management, and since 2013, by an
   armed conflict.}},

Abstract = {{The consequences of converting tropical rainforest to oil palm are
   well-documented, but the impacts of oil palm conversion on natural
   savanna landscapes remain little-known. Natural savannas in South
   America have been identified as fertile grounds for future oil palm
   expansion, partly due to perceived low biodiversity impacts relative to
   forest systems. We quantify the impacts of oil palm conversion for bird
   communities inhabiting natural savannas in the Colombian flaws. Bird
   species richness and abundance were significantly reduced at sampling
   points in oil palm relative to adjacent natural savannas, with marked
   concomitant shifts in community composition. Aquatic, forest and
   grassland specialists all showed significantly lower abundances in oil
   palm habitat relative to savanna, as did migratory species and
   carnivorous/insectivorous dietary guilds. In both habitats, point-level
   species richness and total bird abundance increased with proximity to
   remnant forest patches. Within savanna, total bird abundance also
   decreased with proximity to adjacent oil palm, though species richness
   was not significantly affected. Within oil palm, point-level abundance
   increased with proximity to savanna, suggesting that communities in both
   habitats may be impacted by reciprocal edge or spill-over effects.
   Point-level abundance in oil palm also increased significantly with the
   presence of an invasive vine `kudzu', a species introduced in some
   plantations as a soil protection measure, although species richness was
   not affected. Our work underlines the need for careful monitoring of
   further large-scale agro-industrial conversion in the Llanos. In
   particular, we suggest greater efforts to direct oil palm expansion
   towards already degraded lands (e.g. improved grassland areas currently
   used for intensive cattle grazing) to ensure remaining natural savannas
   are spared.}},

Volume = {{218}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Trade-off between nutrient uptake rate and product accumulation has been
   found among species characterized as acquisitive and conservative
   strategies in resource utilization. However, long-term grazing causes
   changes in soil nutrient availability and plant species abundance by
   selective foraging and resource allocation between above- and
   belowground organs, which may cover up such trade-off. However, little
   is known whether the trade-off can be observed among species in
   community without grazing disturbance, and how grazing influences the
   trade-off. We conducted a N-15 labelling experiment in winter grazing
   and grazing release alpine meadow communities on the Tibet Plateau. We
   examined changes in N form uptake of 11 common species and relationship
   of N chemical uptake rate with aboveground biomass. Grazing release
   increased soil -N and -N, and increased -N uptake rate in two species
   and -N uptake rate in three species. Meanwhile, grazing release
   decreased aboveground biomass of three species and two of them belong to
   those species' increased N uptake rate. Contrarily, grazing release
   increased aboveground biomass of four species and none belongs to the
   changed N uptake rate. Thus, grazing release caused changes of plant
   nutrient uptake rate and aboveground production in different directions,
   which explains the negative relationship of N uptake rate with
   aboveground biomass in ungrazed community. Our results indicate that the
   increase in nutrient uptake is probably one of the mechanisms for
   acquisitive species to cope with the raising nutrient availability
   and/or competition from the conservative dominant grasses after grazing
   release.}},

Title = {{Biodiversity effects on ecosystem functioning in a 15-year grassland
   experiment: Patterns, mechanisms, and open questions}},

Abstract = {{In the past two decades, a large number of studies have investigated the
   relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, most of
   which focussed on a limited set of ecosystem variables. The Jena
   Experiment was set up in 2002 to investigate the effects of plant
   diversity on element cycling and trophic interactions, using a
   multi-disciplinary approach. Here, we review the results of 15 years of
   research in the Jena Experiment, focussing on the effects of
   manipulating plant species richness and plant functional richness. With
   more than 85,000 measures taken from the plant diversity plots, the Jena
   Experiment has allowed answering fundamental questions important for
   functional biodiversity research.
   First, the question was how general the effect of plant species richness
   is, regarding the many different processes that take place in an
   ecosystem. About 45\% of different types of ecosystem processes measured
   in the `main experiment', where plant species richness ranged from 1 to
   60 species, were significantly affected by plant species richness,
   providing strong support for the view that biodiversity is a significant
   driver of ecosystem functioning. Many measures were not saturating at
   the 60-species level, but increased linearly with the logarithm of
   species richness. There was, however, great variability in the strength
   of response among different processes. One striking pattern was that
   many processes, in particular belowground processes, took several years
   to respond to the manipulation of plant species richness, showing that
   biodiversity experiments have to be long-term, to distinguish trends
   from transitory patterns. In addition, the results from the Jena
   Experiment provide further evidence that diversity begets stability, for
   example stability against invasion of plant species, but unexpectedly
   some results also suggested the opposite, e.g. when plant communities
   experience severe perturbations or elevated resource availability. This
   highlights the need to revisit diversity-stability theory.
   Second, we explored whether individual plant species or individual plant
   functional groups, or biodiversity itself is more important for
   ecosystem functioning, in particular biomass production. We found strong
   effects of individual species and plant functional groups on biomass
   production, yet these effects mostly occurred in addition to, but not
   instead of, effects of plant species richness.
   Third, the Jena Experiment assessed the effect of diversity on
   multitrophic interactions. The diversity of most organisms responded
   positively to increases in plant species richness, and the effect was
   stronger for above-than for belowground organisms, and stronger for
   herbivores than for carnivores or detritivores. Thus, diversity begets
   diversity. In addition, the effect on organismic diversity was stronger
   than the effect on species abundances.
   Fourth, the Jena Experiment aimed to assess the effect of diversity on
   N, P and C cycling and the water balance of the plots, separating
   between element input into the ecosystem, element turnover, element
   stocks, and output from the ecosystem. While inputs were generally less
   affected by plant species richness, measures of element stocks, turnover
   and output were often positively affected by plant diversity, e.g.
   carbon storage strongly increased with increasing plant species
   richness. Variables of the N cycle responded less strongly to plant
   species richness than variables of the C cycle.
   Fifth, plant traits are often used to unravel mechanisms underlying the
   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship. In the Jena Experiment,
   most investigated plant traits, both above-and belowground, were plastic
   and trait expression depended on plant diversity in a complex way,
   suggesting limitation to using database traits for linking plant traits
   to particular functions.
   Sixth, plant diversity effects on ecosystem processes are often caused
   by plant diversity effects on species interactions. Analyses in the Jena
   Experiment including structural equation modelling suggest complex
   interactions that changed with diversity, e.g. soil carbon storage and
   greenhouse gas emission were affected by changes in the composition and
   activity of the belowground microbial community. Manipulation
   experiments, in which particular organisms, e.g. belowground
   invertebrates, were excluded from plots in split-plot experiments,
   supported the important role of the biotic component for element and
   water fluxes.
   Seventh, the Jena Experiment aimed to put the results into the context
   of agricultural practices in managed grasslands. The effect of
   increasing plant species richness from 1 to 16 species on plant biomass
   was, in absolute terms, as strong as the effect of a more intensive
   grassland management, using fertiliser and increasing mowing frequency.
   Potential bioenergy production from high-diversity plots was similar to
   that of conventionally used energy crops. These results suggest that
   diverse `High Nature Value Grasslands' are multifunctional and can
   deliver a range of ecosystem services including production-related
   services.
   A final task was to assess the importance of potential artefacts in
   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships, caused by the weeding
   of the plant community to maintain plant species composition. While the
   effort ( in hours) needed to weed a plot was often negatively related to
   plant species richness, species richness still affected the majority of
   ecosystem variables. Weeding also did not negatively affect monoculture
   performance; rather, monocultures deteriorated over time for a number of
   biological reasons, as shown in plant-soil feedback experiments.
   To summarize, the Jena Experiment has allowed for a comprehensive
   analysis of the functional role of biodiversity in an ecosystem. A main
   challenge for future biodiversity research is to increase our
   mechanistic understanding of why the magnitude of biodiversity effects
   differs among processes and contexts. It is likely that there will be no
   simple answer. For example, among the multitude of mechanisms suggested
   to underlie the positive plant species richness effect on biomass, some
   have received limited support in the Jena Experiment, such as vertical
   root niche partitioning. However, others could not be rejected in
   targeted analyses. Thus, from the current results in the Jena
   Experiment, it seems likely that the positive biodiversity effect
   results from several mechanisms acting simultaneously in more diverse
   communities, such as reduced pathogen attack, the presence of more plant
   growth promoting organisms, less seed limitation, and increased trait
   differences leading to complementarity in resource uptake.
   Distinguishing between different mechanisms requires careful testing of
   competing hypotheses. Biodiversity research has matured such that
   predictive approaches testing particular mechanisms are now possible.

   technical help was provided by Uta Gerighausen and Steffen Ferber. All
   student helpers and various ecological volunteers also contributed
   greatly to this experiment. Enrica Luca contributed plant cover data to
   illustrate the long-term changes in the plant community. Norma Nitschke
   summarized data on voles and Manfred Turke kindly illustrated the
   mechanisms underlying the positive biodiversity effect on plant biomass
   (Fig. 23). The first author, who was the `speaker' of the Jena
   Experiment from 2002-2015, would particularly like to thank all people
   involved in the experiment for their contribution to the joint work.
   Scientists come in different shapes and sizes and agreeing on something
   is not always easy. It is a particular feature of the Jena Experiment
   that the group was, mostly, in high spirit so that cooperation was good
   and fruitful. The many joint publications are testimony to the team
   spirit. We also thank Klaus Hoevemeyer for carefully editing the paper.

Abstract = {{1. Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition and climate warming are two major
   components of global change that drive species richness and composition
   in plant communities. However, their combined effects have been
   insufficiently investigated across large spatial and temporal scales
   particularly in high-elevation, nutrient-limited ecosystems.
   2. We examine whether and how N deposition and climate warming have
   altered the plant richness and the composition of subalpine
   semi-natural, extensively grazed grasslands of the Pyrenees, using two
   complementary approaches: (i) analysis of 553 releves to explore
   vegetation changes across large ecological gradients including
   temperature and N deposition (spatial approach) and (ii) a re-sampling
   of a subset of 40 sites among the 553 sites to assess temporal changes
   over the past decades (temporal approach).
   3. Both approaches showed that the vascular plant species richness
   increased when temperature and cumulative N deposition increase,
   shifting the species composition towards more thermophilic and eutrophic
   communities.
   4. Synthesis. We hypothesize that the release from abiotic constraints
   (milder temperature and higher nitrogen availability) due to global
   changes and long-standing extensive grazing counteracting the negative
   effects of nitrogen deposition have been responsible for the diversity
   and compositional changes of plant communities over the last decades in
   the Pyrenees. Thus, in contrast with other grasslands, high-elevation
   grazed grasslands may increase in species diversity with nitrogen
   deposition under climate warming.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionDo trampling and herbivory by small mammals affect salt marsh
   physical and biological properties?
   LocationUpper salt marsh, Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon, Argentina.
   MethodsA field experiment was placed from autumn to early summer in
   runways made by the wild Guinea pig, Cavia aperea. Segments of runways
   were randomly assigned to different treatments: control (herbivory and
   trampling), total exclusion (without herbivory or trampling) and reduced
   trampling (herbivory without trampling). After 8months of experiment,
   soil hardness, runway depth, maximum plant height, above-ground biomass,
   plant assemblages, diversity and richness were measured and compared
   between treatments.
   ResultsRunways of C. aperea covered 14.5\% of the area. Through
   trampling, C.aperea compacted the soil, increasing soil hardness and
   runway depth. Herbivory, in turn, reduced above-ground biomass and plant
   species richness, and affected species composition. Both herbivory and
   trampling decreased the maximum plant height.
   ConclusionOur results show how small herbivores, through trampling, are
   able to drive soil compaction, an effect previously described only for
   large mammals. Results also show that small mammals can control salt
   marsh primary production, reduce species richness and modify the
   composition of plant species through herbivory. Small mammal herbivores,
   thus, can modify physical and biological properties of salt marsh
   communities through both trophic and non-trophic mechanisms.}},

Title = {{Determination of grassland use intensity based on multi-temporal remote

Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},

Abstract = {{Grassland use intensity and its impact on biodiversity and water
   pollution is a topic of growing interest. In ecological studies,
   intensity of use has been assessed by means of three indicators: i)
   mowing frequency, ii) grazing intensity, and iii) fertilization input. A
   multidimensional approach is key for the understanding of
   intensification effects in terrestrial and water ecosystems. Remote
   sensing is a powerful tool to monitor management indicators.
   Nevertheless, interdependencies between remote sensing methods and
   between indicators require new approaches to assess intensity of use.
   The objective of this study is to monitor ecological indicators of land
   use intensity based on multispectral imagery using a multidimensional
   approach. We performed a multi-temporal analysis using a series of
   RapidEye images within a growing season in the Canton of Zurich,
   Switzerland, in 2013. We defined mowing frequency classes distinguishing
   spectral changes between pairs of images. The analysis of the whole
   image sequence within the growing season helped differentiate grazing
   intensities. Furthermore, we analysed the suitability of modelled
   livestock density based on remote sensing derived products to determine
   fertilizer input. Three grassland management practices were
   distinguished: i) medium intensive (46\%), ii) low intensive (37\%), and
   iii) high intensive (17\%). We discuss the combination of high mowing
   frequency and fields with high grazing intensity to define areas prone
   to nutrient surpluses. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimation of
   interrelated indicators of grassland use intensity could be carried out
   preserving independence between methods. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc All

Abstract = {{Once widespread, Australia's bluegrass tussock grasslands (dominated by
   Dichanthium sp.) of the Queensland Central Highlands are now severely
   endangered. Despite being biodiversity rich and highly valued as low
   input, nutrient-dense grazing systems, bluegrass tussock grasslands have
   suffered extensive clearing and degradation over the last 150 years.
   Natural recovery of these grasslands is possible but rates of recovery
   are slow. As such, there is an urgent need to assess practical
   management strategies to accelerate recovery of these grasslands, with a
   particular focus on early-successional stages, when aggressive exotic
   species are most prevalent. To date, no studies have tested whether
   commonly used grassland restoration strategies can enhance
   early-successional stages and accelerate regeneration in this system.
   Here, we examine the early short-term impacts (first two seasons) of two
   common grassland restoration approaches, with two variations each:
   direct seeding (single species and low seed diversity) and vegetation
   clearing (prescribed burning and glyphosate application) across two
   common starting points: a formerly cropped old field and a historically
   overgrazed natural grassland. No treatment increased native diversity
   (Shannon's or richness) in plots but the composition of burned plots in
   the old field did become more similar to healthy reference sites after
   two seasons. Burning combined with direct seeding also increased the
   abundance of the dominant grass, Dichanthium sericeum, toward healthy
   reference levels within the first two seasons post seeding. This study
   provides a practical assessment of the short-term impacts and capacity
   of common grassland restoration treatments to enhance the recovery of
   Australia's tussock grassland systems.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland types associated with highly weathered upland soils derived
   from igneous dolerite and sedimentary sandstone in eastern South Africa
   are rich in restricted range plant species, and have been extensively
   destroyed for agriculture and other land uses. Anthropogenic increases
   in nutrient supply, including atmospheric N deposition, and changes in
   herbivore abundance may alter vegetation and threaten species in
   remaining fragments. We investigated the influence of multiple nutrient
   limitation and herbivory on the productivity, diversity, and composition
   of these distinctive grasslands, as part of the world-wide Nutrient
   Network. We examined nutrient limitation using three years of factorial
   additions of N, P + Ca, and K + micronutrients at two sites, one
   dolerite-derived and one sandstone-derived. Adding N and P + Ca
   increased aboveground productivity at both sites by 33-55\%, indicating
   that these nutrients co-limited productivity. Adding N reduced species
   richness (by 11\%) and effective species richness (by 24\%) at the
   sandstone site; all nutrient additions also tended to reduce diversity
   at the dolerite site. At both sites, adding N increased the abundance of
   grasses at the expense of (N-fixing) legumes, which declined in relative
   abundance by 44-60\%, whereas adding P + Ca tended to increase the
   abundance of legumes. At the dolerite site, a factorial fencing and
   nutrient addition experiment showed that large herbivores did not
   significantly influence vegetation during three years. Widely increasing
   atmospheric N deposition, and perhaps warming-induced increases in N
   mineralization at high elevation, will likely increase productivity,
   reduce diversity, and reduce legume abundance in these dolerite and
   sandstone grasslands, posing an additional challenge to conserving them.

Abstract = {{1. Land-use change is an important component of global environmental
   change and a major driver of current declines in biodiversity. Although
   there is increasing evidence that species can evolve rapidly in response
   to anthropogenic environmental change, comprehensive studies of the
   evolutionary consequences of land use are still fairly scarce, in
   particular such that consider multiple species, study many populations,
   or that discriminate between different aspects of land use.
   2. Here, we studied genetic change of key phenotypic traits in response
   to land use in eight common grassland species across 137 grassland sites
   covering a broad range of land-use types (mowing and/or grazing, with or
   without fertilization) and intensities in three regions of Germany.
   3. A common garden study revealed significant genetic differentiation in
   response to land-use intensification within all of the investigated
   species. Among the studied land-use processes, mowing appeared to have
   the strongest effect on the differentiation of plant phenotypes, with
   flowering phenology as the most responsive trait. However, there was
   substantial variation among species in the magnitude, sometimes also the
   direction of the observed population differentiation.
   4. Synthesis. Our study demonstrates that evolutionary responses of
   grassland plants to land-use change are a common phenomenon and
   widespread across a broad range of different species. These evolutionary
   changes are likely to impact biotic interactions, as well as the
   structure and functioning of communities and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fragmentation has been found to affect biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning in multiple ways. We asked whether forest size and isolation
   in fragmented woodlands influences the climate warming sensitivity of
   tree growth in the southern boreal forest of the Mongolian Larix
   sibirica forest steppe, a naturally fragmented woodland embedded in
   grassland, which is highly affected by warming, drought, and increasing
   anthropogenic forest destruction in recent time. We examined the
   influence of stand size and stand isolation on the growth performance of
   larch in forests of four different size classes located in a
   woodland-dominated forest-steppe area and small forest patches in a
   grassland-dominated area. We found increasing climate sensitivity and
   decreasing first-order autocorrelation of annual stemwood increment with
   decreasing stand size. Stemwood increment increased with previous year's
   June and August precipitation in the three smallest forest size classes,
   but not in the largest forests. In the grassland-dominated area, the
   tree growth dependence on summer rainfall was highest. Missing ring
   frequency has strongly increased since the 1970s in small, but not in
   large forests. In the grassland-dominated area, the increase was much
   greater than in the forest-dominated landscape. Forest regeneration
   decreased with decreasing stand size and was scarce or absent in the
   smallest forests. Our results suggest that the larch trees in small and
   isolated forest patches are far more susceptible to climate warming than
   in large continuous forests pointing to a grim future for the forests in
   this strongly warming region of the boreal forest that is also under
   high land use pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Liqvan (or Lighvan) is a traditional Iranian cheese from the East
   Azerbaijan province of Iran, which is made of raw ewe's milk without the
   addition of a starter. The grazing pastures, environmental conditions
   and the ancient regional production methods allocate a distinctive
   microbial ecology to this type of cheese, and these factors are
   consequently associated with the quality of the product. In this study,
   the microbiota of the milk, curd and cheese has been investigated using
   culture independent approaches. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis
   (DGGE) of the bacteria, 16S rRNA based high-throughput sequencing and
   enumeration of the live bacterial community by means of quantitative PCR
   (qPCR) have been used for this purpose. The results showed that the main
   bacterial population in the milk belonged to both microbial contaminants
   and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). However, both of these populations were
   totally replaced by LAB during ripening. The present survey contributes
   by describing the microbiota of this ancient cheese in more detail
   during fermentation and ripening. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Interactions count: plant origin, herbivory and disturbance jointly
   explain seedling recruitment and community structure}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Herbivory and disturbance are major drivers of biological invasions, but
   it is unclear how they interact to determine exotic vs. native seedling
   recruitment and what consequences arise for biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning. Previous studies neglected the roles of different,
   potentially interacting, guilds of generalist herbivores such as rodents
   and gastropods. We therefore set up a full-factorial rodent exclusion x
   gastropod exclusion x disturbance x seed-addition experiment in a
   grassland community in Central Germany and measured early seedling
   recruitment, as well as species richness, species composition and
   aboveground biomass. Gastropod herbivory reduced the positive effect of
   disturbance on seedling recruitment, particularly for exotic species.
   Rodent herbivory had weak positive effects on seedling recruitment at
   undisturbed sites, irrespective of species origin. This effect was
   likely driven by their strong negative effect on productivity.
   Interactive effects between both herbivore guilds became only evident
   for species richness and composition. How many species established
   themselves depended on disturbance, but was independent of species
   origin. The fewer exotic species that established themselves increased
   productivity to a stronger extent compared to native species. Our study
   highlights that joint effects of disturbance, herbivory and species
   origin shape early recruitment, while they only weakly affect
   biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding of species distribution, abundance and habitat affinities
   is crucial for red-list assessment, conservation and habitat management.
   In Central Finland, we studied Collembola in three habitat types, namely
   non-grazed meadows, pastures and road verges using pitfall traps.
   Altogether, 9,630 Collembola individuals were recorded. These belonged
   to 12 families, 34 genera and 60 species. The number of specimens was
   clearly higher in meadows than in pastures or road verges. The number of
   species, however, was higher in meadows and road verges (40 and 39
   species, respectively) than in pastures (33 species). The overall
   species number is comparable to other large-scale sampling schemes in
   similar habitats. We recorded a few abundant species (Spatulosminthurus
   flaviceps, Sminthurus viridis and Sminthurus nigromaculatus) that have
   been previously recorded from very different biotopes. In conclusion,
   biodiversity inventories of soil fauna, as well as other biota, should
   also include marginal habitats, which often host peculiar communities.}},

   grasslands: Mowing annually vs. every third year}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{22}},
Pages = {{61-74}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Mowing is an important management method for species-rich semi-natural
   grasslands in Europe. Since mowing is costly, it is important to find a
   balance between mowing frequency and conservation benefits. We compared
   vegetation data from eleven field trials situated in southern Sweden
   that involved two mowing regimes, annually and every third year, as well
   as a no-management control. After approximately 14 years, mowing every
   third year showed (i) a drop in species richness and Shannon and
   GiniSimpson diversity indices, (ii) an increase in woody species, and
   (iii) increases in tall-grown species. However, there were no apparent
   changes in (iv) species that were indicative of poor management, nor (v)
   those indicating good management. For one of the trials, data after 38
   years were also evaluated. Compared with annual mowing, there were
   strong negative changes in the number of species in the untreated
   control, while the results were conflicting for mowing every third year.
   In conclusion, the expected loss of conservation values from reduced
   mowing intensity was 5060\% of the loss after abandonment. The outcomes,
   however, varied among the eleven sites. (C) 2017 Gesellschaft fur

Abstract = {{We present an overview of high nitrogen deposition effects on coastal
   dune grasslands in NW-Europe (H2130), especially concerning grass
   encroachment in calcareous and acidic Grey Dunes. The problem is larger
   than previously assumed, because critical loads are still too high, and
   extra N-input from the sea may amount to 10 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Grass
   encroachment clearly leads to loss of characteristic plant species, from
   approximately 16 in open dune grassland to 2 in tall-grass vegetation.
   Dune zones differ in grass encroachment, due to the chemical status of
   the soil. In calcareous and iron-rich dunes,(Renodunal district), grass
   encroachment showed a clear gradient over the dune area. Grass
   encroachment is low in calcareous foredunes, due to low P-availability,
   and large grazers were not needed to counteract, grass encroachment
   after 2001. In partly decalcified middle dunes, P-availability and grass
   encroachment are high due to dissolution of calcium phosphates, and
   grazing only partially helped to control this. In acidic, iron-rich
   hinterdunes, grass encroachment gradually increased between 1990 and
   2014, possibly because P-availability increased with time due to
   increased soil organic matter content. In acidic, iron-poor dunes
   (Wadden district), grass encroachment is a large problem, because
   chemical P-fixation with Ca or Fe does not occur. Large grazers may
   however reduce tall-grass cover. High cumulative N-deposition could
   theoretically lead to increased N-storage and N-mineralization in the
   soil. Mineralization indeed increased with N-deposition, but in N-15
   experiments, most ammonium was converted to nitrate, and storage in soil
   Organic matter was low. Soil N-storage is probably reduced by high
   nitrate leaching, which will favour dune restoration when N-deposition
   levels decrease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Species diversity depends on, often interfering, multiple ecological
   drivers. Comprehensive approaches are hence needed to understand the
   mechanisms determining species diversity. In this study, we analysed the
   impact of vegetation structure, soil properties and fragmentation on the
   plant species diversity of remnant calcareous grasslands, therefore, in
   a comparative approach.
   We determined plant species diversity of 18 calcareous grasslands in
   south eastern Germany including all species and grassland specialists
   separately. Furthermore, we analysed the spatial structure of the
   grasslands as a result of fragmentation during the last 150 years
   (habitat area, distance to the nearest calcareous grassland and
   connectivity in 1830 and 2013). We also collected data concerning the
   vegetation structure (height of the vegetation, cover of bare soil,
   grass and litter) and the soil properties (content of phosphorous and
   potassium, ratio of carbon and nitrogen) of the grassland patches. Data
   were analysed using Bayesian multiple regressions.
   We observed a habitat loss of nearly 80\% and increasing isolation
   between grasslands since 1830. In the Bayesian multiple regressions the
   species diversity of the studied grasslands depended negatively on cover
   of litter and to a lower degree on the distance to the nearest
   calcareous grassland in 2013, whereas soil properties had no significant
   impact.
   Our study supports the observation that vegetation structure, which
   strongly depends on land use, is often more important for the species
   richness of calcareous grasslands than fragmentation or soil properties.
   Even small and isolated grasslands may, therefore, contribute
   significantly to the conservation of species diversity, when they are
   still grazed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eastern European grasslands are still inhabited by a rich arthropod
   fauna, but the drivers and mechanisms influencing their communities have
   to be understood to ensure their future survival. Heteroptera
   communities were studied in 20 plot-pairs in Pannonic salt steppe-salt
   marsh mosaics in Hungary. The effects of vegetation characteristics,
   landscape diversity and the proportion of surrounding grasslands on the
   composition, species richness and abundance of different feeding groups
   of true bugs (carnivores, specialist and generalist herbivores) were
   examined using ordinations and mixed-effect models. We found distinct
   herbivorous assemblages corresponding to microtopography-driven
   differences in water regime and vegetation between steppe and marsh
   plots, but this pattern was less pronounced in carnivorous assemblages.
   A higher species richness of true bugs was found in the more diverse
   steppe vegetation than in the salt marsh vegetation, while the abundance
   pattern of true bugs was opposite. Landscape diversity had a positive
   effect on the species richness and abundance of generalist herbivores
   and carnivores. Our results suggested that generalist herbivores and
   carnivores appear to drive diversity patterns in the local landscape due
   to their high dispersal abilities and the broader range of resources
   they can utilize. Specialist herbivores strongly influence the local
   insect biomass in relation to the distribution and density of their host
   plants. The present study highlights the importance of both habitat and
   landscape diversity for local insect diversity in Pannonic salt
   grasslands and suggests that the main threats for arthropod diversity
   are those processes and activities that homogenize these areas.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF), the simultaneous provision of
   multiple ecosystem functions, is often affected by biodiversity and
   environmental factors. We know little about how the interactions between
   biodiversity and environmental factors affect EMF. In this case study, a
   structural equation model was used to clarify climatic and geographic
   pathways that affect EMF by varying biodiversity in the Tibetan alpine
   grasslands. In addition to services related to carbon, nitrogen, and
   water cycling, forage supply, which is related to plant productivity and
   palatability, was included in the EMF index. The results showed that
   72\% of the variation in EMF could be explained by biodiversity and
   other environmental factors. The ratio of palatable richness to all
   species richness explained 8.3\% of the EMF variation. We found that air
   temperature, elevation, and latitude all affected EMF, but in different
   ways. Air temperature and elevation impacted the aboveground parts of
   the ecosystem, which included plant height, aboveground biomass,
   richness of palatable species, and ratio of palatable richness to all
   species richness. Latitude affected EMF by varying both aboveground and
   belowground parts of the ecosystem, which included palatable species
   richness and belowground biomass. Our results indicated that there are
   still uncertainties in the biodiversity-EMF relationships related to the
   variable components of EMF, and climatic and geographic factors.
   Clarification of pathways that affect EMF using structural equation
   modeling techniques could elucidate the mechanisms by which
   environmental changes affect EMF.}},

Title = {{Impacts of grazing intensity and increased precipitation on a

Abstract = {{1. Grasshoppers are dominant herbivores in grassland ecosystems, and
   many studies have examined how grazing by large herbivores and
   precipitation patterns individually influence the dynamics of grassland
   grasshopper assemblages, but their combined effects are largely unknown.
   2. In this study, grazing intensities (ungrazed, moderate, and heavy)
   were manipulated and precipitation (ambient and increased amount of
   rainfall) altered in a field experiment to test the effects of grazing
   and altered precipitation on a grasshopper community in a meadow steppe
   in northeastern China.
   3. It was found that grasshopper species richness did not change
   according to different grazing intensities under ambient precipitation,
   but was significantly higher (by 38.1\%) in moderate grazing intensities
   under increased precipitation. Grasshopper abundance increased
   considerably with increasing grazing intensities in ambient
   precipitation treatments; however, grasshopper abundance in heavy
   grazing intensities was significantly lower (by 32.9\%) than in the
   other two grazing intensities under increased precipitation. Moreover,
   the responses of grasshopper abundance to grazing under altered
   precipitation were species-specific.
   4. Grazing effects on grasshopper species diversity were mediated
   through the species richness and biomass of grasses (food resources),
   but the effects on grasshopper abundance were mediated through plant
   height (vegetation structure) under altered precipitation.
   5. These results suggest that appropriate grazing by large herbivores
   would be considered as beneficial management practices for maintaining
   grasshopper diversity and abundance under conditions of increased
   precipitation in grassland ecosystems. Additionally, greater attention
   should be paid to the population dynamics of different grasshopper
   species to better understand the responses of grasslands to grazing and
   altered precipitation.}},

Title = {{Rotation grazing as a conservation management tool: Vegetation changes

Volume = {{246}},

Abstract = {{Grazing is commonly used in conservation to promote biodiversity, but
   the search for a grazing management regime that optimises biodiversity
   is still ongoing. Rotation grazing, where grazing is followed by a
   relatively long period of non-grazing, is a relative new tool in
   conservation management, and empirical studies on its effects on
   biodiversity are scarce. In this study, we tested for the effects of
   this rotation grazing on vegetation in comparison with more traditional
   regimes. We used a grazing experiment on the salt marsh of
   Noord-Friesland Buitendijks, The Netherlands, where we determined the
   effect of three rotation cycles (6 years; one year summer grazing with 1
   cattle ha(-1) alternated with an ungrazed year) on species richness,
   temporal turnover and composition in comparison with more traditional
   regimes of summer grazing with horses and cattle at two densities (0.5
   and 1 animal ha(-1)): We also determined the change in cover of two
   species of specific concern, Aster tripolium (an important host plant
   for pollinators) and Elytrigia atherica (an invasive dominant species).
   After six years, species richness increased in all grazing regimes, but
   less in rotation than in grazing with 1 horse or 1 cattle ha(-1).
   Species turnover was similar across all grazing regimes. Species
   composition in rotation differed from compositions in 1 cattle and 1
   horse ha(-1). The increase in cover of A. tripolium was lower under
   rotation than grazing with 0.5 cattle ha(-1), but not different to the
   other regimes. Change in cover of E. atherica did not significantly
   differ across regimes, and showed a trend of increase in the ungrazed
   regime only. Hence, we found that the effects of rotation grazing on
   vegetation are relatively similar to the grazing regimes with cattle or
   horses in low densities. The implementation of this rotation regime over
   the more traditional regimes remains to be decided by the conservation
   body, depending on its applicability in terms of available grazing areas
   and livestock, as well as overall conservation goals.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity of semi-natural grasslands depends on the management
   practices used. However, management systems suitable for one taxon, such
   as plants, can be detrimental to other taxa, such as insects, and vice
   versa. This study attempts to support conservation management planning
   by clarifying the effects of different grassland management practices on
   species richness and species composition of vascular plants,
   butterflies, moths, orthopterans and ground beetles, also taking into
   account the effects of climate and the landscape context. The study was
   performed in the White Carpathians Protected Landcape Area and UNESCO
   Biosphere Reserve (Czech Republic), which is famous for its grasslands
   with the globally highest fine-scale plant species richness. Different
   management practices (mowing, grazing, abandonment and mixed management;
   the latter including the previous three) were applied for at least five
   consecutive years at 34 sites, where plants and different insect groups
   were subsequently sampled. Effects of management on species richness of
   different taxonomic groups were assessed using generalised linear
   models, whereas the effects on species composition were assessed using
   redundancy analysis. Management influenced plant, butterfly and moth
   species richness, but the effects of particular management practices on
   all species and species of regional conservation importance differed
   between these taxonomic groups. Plant and moth species richness
   increased with mowing, but moth species richness decreased with grazing.
   Mixed management favoured plant and butterfly richness. Plant species
   composition was infuenced by mowing, grazing and mixed management while
   that of moths by mowing and grazing. Orthopterans and ground beetles did
   not respond significantly to management. Our results indicate that
   conservation management should comprise the traditional practices that
   have historically contributed to the formation of the biological
   diversity of the semi-natural grasslands in the study area. In
   particular, grazing may not be optimal for traditional hay-meadows and
   mowing should be carried out similarly as in pre-intensive farmland,
   creating spatio-temporal heterogeneity rather than uniformly cutting
   large grassland areas during a short period. In general, the optimal
   management should be heterogeneous, applying different practices in a
   mosaic or at different times during the season.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known regarding the impact of converting northern hardwood
   forests to pasture or silvopasture. Our objective was to investigate how
   understory plant communities and soil physical and chemical properties
   respond during the first 2 years following conversion of northern
   hardwood forest to pasture. To accomplish this, we established three
   forest conversion treatments (silvopasture, open pasture, and woodlot)
   in a 50 year old northern hardwood forest in New York. The silvopasture
   and open pasture treatments were seeded with forages and then grazed
   with cattle after the initial timber harvest. Understory plant
   inventories and soil sampling were conducted pre-treatment and 2 years
   after treatment establishment. Understory non-woody plant species
   richness increased in all treatments during the two year period (F =
   73.633, P < 0.001), while species richness of understory woody plants
   remained similar to pretreatment levels (F = 2.648, P = 0.150). Species
   most negatively affected by forest conversion included Arisaema
   triphyllum, Mitchella repens, and Thalictrum pubescens. Species that
   were only observed after the treatments were established included
   Danthonia spicata, Agrostis spp., Ranunculus spp., Digitaria spp., Rumex
   acetosella, and Hieracium spp. One species, Vaccinium angustifolium, was
   negatively affected by the silvopasture and open pasture treatments, but
   not the woodlot treatment. Soil bulk density was higher in both the open
   and silvopasture treatments compared to pretreatment levels, but the
   woodlot treatment soil bulk density remained statistically similar to

Abstract = {{Ecological connectivity networks have been proposed as an efficient way
   to reconnect communities in fragmented landscapes. Yet few studies have
   evaluated if they are successful at enhancing actual functional
   connectivity (i.e. realized dispersal or gene flow) of focal species, or
   if this enhanced connectivity is enough to maintain genetic diversity
   and fitness of plant populations. Here we test the efficacy of an
   ecological connectivity network implemented in southern Germany since
   1989 to reconnect calcareous grassland fragments through rotational
   shepherding. We genotyped 1449 individuals from 57 populations and
   measured fitness-related traits in 10 populations of Puisatilla
   vulgaris, a flagship species of calcareous grasslands in Europe. We
   tested if the shepherding network explained functional connectivity in
   P. vulgaris and if higher connectivity translated to higher genetic
   diversity and fitness of populations. We found that population-specific
   F-st was lowest in populations that had high connectivity within the
   shepherding network, and that well-connected populations within the
   network had significantly higher genetic diversity than ungrazed and
   more isolated grazed populations. Moreover, genetic diversity was
   significantly positively correlated with both seed set and seed mass.
   Together our results suggest that the implementation of an ecological
   shepherding network is an effective management measure to maintain
   functional connectivity and genetic diversity at the landscape scale for
   a calcareous grassland specialist. Populations with reduced genetic
   diversity would likely benefit from inclusion, or better integration
   into the ecological connectivity network. Our study demonstrates the
   often postulated but rarely tested sequence of positive associations
   between connectivity, genetic diversity, and fitness at the landscape
   scale, and provides a framework for testing the efficacy of ecological
   connectivity networks for focal species using molecular genetic tools.}},

Abstract = {{Assessing effectiveness of international biodiversity targets requires
   long-term monitoring of species to identify changes in their abundance.
   Grasslands cover large areas of many countries, provide high levels of
   provisioning ecosystem services and are an important habitat for many
   species. While grasslands are often anthropogenic in nature,
   human-induced environmental perturbations are acknowledged threats to
   their biodiversity and functioning. Using a repeat survey of grassland
   plots in Scotland, UK we identified long-term changes in community
   composition and species indices over a 40 year period (1973-2013).
   Scottish grasslands were found to have changed significantly over this
   time. Species richness increased, while diversity declined as dominant
   species increased in cover. Nitrogen-demanding and moisture-requiring
   species increased, possibly reflecting increases in atmospheric nitrogen
   deposition and rainfall over this time. In Acid and Nardus grasslands
   species with low tolerance to very acidic soils increased, possibly
   reflecting a decrease in sulphur deposition. Overall beta-diversity
   showed no change, indicating that contrary to trends in other habitats,
   homogenisation has not occurred. In general bryophytes and low-growing
   forb and grass species declined while taller species increased. This may
   reflect either the decline in grazing in recent years or the increase in
   atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Species richness increased but the
   majority of species declined in cover while a few dominant species
   increased suggesting that an extinction debt may be establishing. The
   trade-offs between increased management to reduce the extinction debt
   and abandonment with increased shrub cover which might be beneficial to
   other wildlife is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) deposition is a major cause of plant biodiversity loss,
   with serious implications for appropriate management of protected sites.
   Reducing N emissions is the only long-term solution. However, on-site
   management has the potential to mitigate some of the adverse effects of
   N deposition. In this paper we review how management activities such as
   grazing, cutting, burning, hydrological management and soil disturbance
   measures can mitigate the negative impacts of N across a range of
   temperate habitats (acid, calcareous and neutral grasslands, sand dunes
   and other coastal habitats, heathlands, bogs and fens). The review
   focuses mainly on European habitats, which have a long history of N
   deposition, and it excludes forested systems. For each management type
   we distinguish between actions that improve habitat suitability for
   plant species of conservation importance, and actions that immobilize N
   or remove it from the system. For grasslands and heathlands we collate
   data on the quantity of N removal by each management type. Our findings
   show that while most activities improve habitat suitability, the
   majority do little to slow or to reduce the amount of N accumulating in
   soil pools at current deposition rates. Only heavy cutting/mowing with
   removal in grasslands, high intensity burns in heathlands and sod
   cutting remove more N than comes in from deposition under typical
   management cycles. We conclude by discussing some of the unintended
   consequences of managing specifically for N impacts, which can include
   damage to non-target species, alteration of soil processes, loss of the
   seedbank and loss of soil carbon. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{1. Trait-based approaches represent a promising way to understand how
   trophic interactions shape animal communities. The approach relies on
   the identification of the traits that mediate the linkages between
   adjacent trophic levels, i.e. `trait-matching'. Yet, how trait-matching
   explains the abundance and diversity of animal communities has been
   barely explored. This question may be particularly critical in the
   context of land-use intensification, currently threatening biodiversity
   and associated ecosystem services.
   2. We collected a large dataset on plant and grasshopper traits from
   communities living in 204 grasslands, in an intensively managed
   agricultural landscape. We used a multi-trait approach to quantify the
   relative contributions of trait-matching and land-use intensification
   acting at both local and landscape scales on grasshopper functional
   diversity. We considered two key independent functional traits: incisor
   strength and body size of grasshopper species. Incisor strength, a
   resource-acquisition trait, strongly matches grasshopper feeding niche.
   Body size correlates with mobility traits, and may determine grasshopper
   dispersal abilities.
   3. Plant functional diversity positively impacted the diversity of
   grasshopper resource-acquisition traits, according to the degree of
   trait-matching observed between plants and herbivores. However, this
   positive effect was significantly higher in old grasslands. In addition,
   the presence of specific habitats in the landscape (i.e. wood and
   alfalfa) strongly enhanced grasshopper resource-acquisition trait
   diversity in the focal grassland. Finally, grasshopper body size
   increased with landscape simplification, although the response was
   modulated by local factors such as soil depth.
   4. Trait-matching between plants and herbivores was an important driver
   explaining the abundance and diversity of resource-acquisition traits
   within grasshopper communities. However, the presence of specific
   habitats in the surrounding landscape had also a strong influence on
   herbivore functional diversity in grasslands. Our study suggests that
   also mass effects are a central mechanism promoting higher functional
   diversity within animal communities in highly disturbed anthropogenic
   systems.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1637-1646}},

Abstract = {{1. Global reactive nitrogen (N) is projected to further increase in the
   coming years. Previous studies have demonstrated that N enrichment
   weakens the temporal stability of the ecosystem and the primary
   productivity through decreased biodiversity and species asynchrony.
   Mowing is a globally common practise in grasslands; and infrequent
   mowing can maintain or increase plant diversity under N enrichment
   conditions. However, it is unclear how infrequent mowing affects
   ecosystem stability in the face of N enrichment.
   2. By independently manipulating the frequency (twice vs. monthly
   additions per year) and rate (i.e. 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 50 g N
   m(-2) year(-1)) of NH4NO3 inputs and mowing (unmown vs. mown) over 3
   years (2011-2013) in a temperate grassland of northern China, we aimed
   to examine the interactive effects of N enrichment and mowing on
   ecosystem stability.
   3. The results show that mowing maintained a positive relationship
   between species richness and ecosystem stability despite N addition, but
   that it exacerbated the negative effects of N addition on ecosystem
   stability. Mowing increased mean primary productivity and plant species
   richness, but it also increased the synchrony of population fluctuations
   and the variability of primary productivity under N enrichment, thereby
   contributing to a decline in the ecosystem stability.
   4. Thus, our study reveals that infrequent mowing can buffer the
   negative effects of N enrichment on biodiversity to some extent and
   further increase the primary productivity, but it exacerbates the loss
   of ecosystem stability with N enrichment, thereby threatening local
   and/or semiarid regional food security.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use change is one of the primary drivers of species loss, yet
   little is known about its effect on other components of biodiversity
   that may be at risk. Here, we ask whether, and to what extent, landscape
   simplification, measured as the percentage of arable land in the
   landscape, disrupts the functional and phylogenetic association between
   primary producers and consumers. Across seven European regions, we
   inferred the potential associations (functional and phylogenetic)
   between host plants and butterflies in 561 seminatural grasslands. Local
   plant diversity showed a strong bottom-up effect on butterfly diversity
   in the most complex landscapes, but this effect disappeared in simple
   landscapes. The functional associations between plant and butterflies
   are, therefore, the results of processes that act not only locally but
   are also dependent on the surrounding landscape context. Similarly,
   landscape simplification reduced the phylogenetic congruence among host
   plants and butterflies indicating that closely related butterflies
   become more generalist in the resources used. These processes occurred
   without any detectable change in species richness of plants or
   butterflies along the gradient of arable land. The structural properties
   of ecosystems are experiencing substantial erosion, with potentially
   pervasive effects on ecosystem functions and future evolutionary
   trajectories. Loss of interacting species might trigger cascading
   extinction events and reduce the stability of trophic interactions, as
   well as influence the longer term resilience of ecosystem functions.
   This underscores a growing realization that species richness is a crude
   and insensitive metric and that both functional and phylogenetic
   associations, measured across multiple trophic levels, are likely to
   provide additional and deeper insights into the resilience of ecosystems
   and the functions they provide.}},

Title = {{Continuous soil carbon storage of old permanent pastures in Amazonia}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3382-3392}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Amazonian forests continuously accumulate carbon (C) in biomass and in
   soil, representing a carbon sink of 0.420.65 GtC yr(-1). In recent
   decades, more than 15\% of Amazonian forests have been converted into
   pastures, resulting in net C emissions (similar to 200 tC ha(-1)) due to
   biomass burning and litter mineralization in the first years after
   deforestation. However, little is known about the capacity of tropical
   pastures to restore a C sink. Our study shows in French Amazonia that
   the C storage observed in native forest can be partly restored in old
   (>= 24 year) tropical pastures managed with a low stocking rate (+/- 1
   LSU ha(-1)) and without the use of fire since their establishment. A
   unique combination of a large chronosequence study and eddy covariance
   measurements showed that pastures stored between >= 1.27 +/- 0.37 and
   -5.31 +/- 2.08 tC ha(-1) yr(-1) while the nearby native forest stored
   -3.31 +/- 0.44 tC ha(-1) yr(-1). This carbon is mainly sequestered in
   the humus of deep soil layers (20-100 cm), whereas no C storage was
   observed in the 0- to 20-cm layer. C storage in C4 tropical pasture is
   associated with the installation and development of C3 species, which
   increase either the input of N to the ecosystem or the C: N ratio of
   soil organic matter. Efforts to curb deforestation remain an obvious
   priority to preserve forest C stocks and biodiversity. However, our
   results show that if sustainable management is applied in tropical
   pastures coming from deforestation (avoiding fires and overgrazing,
   using a grazing rotation plan and a mixture of C3 and C4 species), they
   can ensure a continuous C storage, thereby adding to the current C sink
   of Amazonian forests.}},

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Invasive species spread on natural ecosystems is one of the most
   important causes of biodiversity loss. To disentangle the invasive plant
   impact on communities it is essential to combine experimental and
   observation approaches, which enable the correct interpretations of
   results and lead to the right decisions for management. We examined the
   invasion of southern Brazil's grasslands by Eragrostis plana, which is
   currently the most problematic invasive species in the region. By means
   of an experiment on invaded communities complemented by observation of
   non-invaded communities, we assessed E.plana impact on vegetation,
   evaluated community response to its removal and discussed the
   effectiveness of removal methods. Fifty permanent 1x1m plots were
   located on natural grassland that was partially invaded by E.plana.
   Removal was done annually from 2012 to 2015 and consisted of five
   treatments (n=10): (i) clipping above-ground biomass on one occasion;
   (ii) clipping above-ground biomass periodically; (iii) herbicide and
   (iv) hand-pulling, plus (v) control treatment with no-removal. In
   addition, 10 plots located in an adjacent non-invaded area were
   monitored. All removal treatments reduced E.plana cover across years,
   but were not enough to eradicate it. Our results revealed not only
   differences between invaded and non-invaded communities, but also an
   effect of E.plana removal on resident species richness and total cover.
   At the local scale, we demonstrated the impact of E.plana invasion on
   grassland vegetation, suggesting a reduction in resident species
   richness and total cover. Invasive species removal changed communities
   differently from invaded ones, but not resembling non-invaded
   references, suggesting that community recovery may need more time for
   reestablishment or that some restoration strategies are
   required.Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrated the impact
   on vegetation of the most important invasive species in southern
   Brazil's natural grasslands. We highlighted the advantages of combining
   observations of non-invaded communities and experimental studies on
   invaded communities, with and without invasive removal, to help infer
   causal relationships in ecological invasion research.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal habitats are rich in biodiversity and provide highly valued
   ecosystem services. However, they are subject to many environmental
   drivers that can have severe impacts on these inherently fragile
   ecosystems. A resurvey approach was used to assess changes in species'
   abundances and occupancy on sand dunes and machair in Scotland, UK to
   assess how this could impact on this set of habitats. These were
   assessed to see if increasers and decreasers shared common trait values,
   if trends were similar to other terrestrial habitats and if responses to
   environmental drivers were modulated by traits. In general, there has
   been a shift towards taller species with more exploitative growth forms
   and an increase in indicators of unfavourable habitat condition
   according to criteria for assessing sites designated for nature
   protection as part of the EU Natura 2000 network, particularly tall
   grasses characteristic of nutrient-rich conditions exemplified by
   Arrhenatherum elatius. Coastal heathlands have been particularly
   affected by the increase in species such as Betula spp. and Pteridium
   aquilinum which can dominate and exclude other heathland species. On
   average, increasing species were both more common nationally and
   increasing nationally, suggesting increasing homogenisation between sand
   dunes/machair and other terrestrial habitats. Changes have been faster
   and more negative in conservation terms in cooler, drier and more
   polluted sites (mainly on the east coast of Scotland) and also in sites
   which had seen reductions in grazing. Reinstating grazing could
   counteract some of the negative impacts of eutrophication, but this
   could prove problematic to integrate with recreational activities and
   the largely arable based farming systems adjacent to these sites.}},

Abstract = {{Valuable habitats in various spatial configurations are essential for
   maintaining biodiversity across highly fragmented urban landscapes. In a
   large-scale study, we explored the value of human-made structures -
   river levees - as valuable habitats that support large populations of
   plants and butterflies and affects the spatial turnover of species
   within an urban landscape. The most significant environmental variables
   affecting plant and butterfly populations on levees were also examined.
   The richness of native plant species was about 25\% greater on levee
   transects than on control grassland transects. However, the richness and
   abundance of butterflies on levees were the same as on grassland sites.
   Among environmental factors, urban area cover negatively affected the
   richness of native plant species. Shrub cover decreases the richness and
   abundance of butterfly species. In addition, high mowing intensity had a
   negative influence on abundance. Community dissimilarity of plants on
   levees was affected by spatial variables. Our study is the first to
   highlight levees as significant habitats for plant and herbivorous
   insect persistence, and their potential function for plant dispersal.

Abstract = {{Secondary succession on abandoned pastures in the Amazon is
   characterized by low diversity and slow turnover of plant species in the
   early decades. Here we present the results of a 6-year experiment in
   order to evaluate the effects of artificially created forest gaps
   established in 20-year old Vismia-dominated secondary forests in Central
   Amazonia. Plant diversity and composition of trees <= 5 cm DBH were
   assessed in 21,100-m(2) lightgaps evenly distributed in three
   topographic positions (plateau, slope, and bottomland). These empirical
   results were compared with four uncut, control plots nearby the
   experimental plots. There were no topographic effects on plant density
   and species richness for either the two size classes analyzed (seedlings
   <1 cm DBH and saplings 1-5 cm DBH). Irrespective of topographic level,
   tree density varied significantly before and six years after lightgap
   formation, for the both size classes. At six years after gap creation,
   the number of species increased by 30\% for the seedlings, despite of
   the fact that the density declined significantly following creation of
   the lightgaps. As a result, there was a more rapid species accumulation
   than prior to lightgap creation. However, for the saplings the increase
   in species richness could be explained by the increase in the number of
   individuals over the six-year period. There were no significant changes
   in tree density and species richness for either size class for the
   control plots. Species composition diverged greatly from before to six
   years after cutting, for both size classes, as revealed by the NMDS
   ordinations. Moreover, for seedlings there was greater floristic
   similarity among plots before lightgap creation in comparison to evident
   divergence six years later. In contrast, for saplings floristic
   composition among plots was more similar after six years than prior to
   lightgap formation. There was little difference in floristic composition
   before lightgap formation and control plots. Lack of seed dispersal can
   be an important obstacle to natural regeneration of degraded pastures in
   the tropics. However, the lightgaps showed a marked increase in
   old-growth species originating from surrounding mature forests six years
   later. On intensely used sites where succession is slow, small-scale
   disturbance represent a feasible management tool to accelerate natural
   regeneration. Forest regeneration on abandoned pastures will depend on
   the regional pool of species and their successful establishment in
   secondary forest. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined local people's perceptions of rangeland resources in
   three communal grasslands of South Africa and compared them with the
   views of ecologists. A total of 30 households that own livestock and two
   elder groups (eight elders per group) were selected in each communal
   area. Local respondents perceived that vegetation change mainly refers
   to change in species richness, diversity and abundance in vegetation
   that is not necessarily related to loss of productivity, feed shortage
   or rangeland degradation (deterioration). However, most ecologists used
   vegetation change and rangeland degradation synonymously to explain
   environmental changes. Most respondents regarded abiotic and biotic
   factors as the primary drivers of vegetation change and degradation,
   respectively. Respondents also mentioned a third group of factors,
   termed as `institutional', which have been overlooked by most
   ecologists. One group of factors may be more important than the other
   but we argue that it is difficult to uncouple them to explain the
   determinants of vegetation change and degradation within the context of
   the `commons'. The impact of human settlement expansion on grazing lands
   was less recognised by the respondents but we believe this poses a
   threat to rangelands by reducing and fragmenting grazing resources.
   About 50\% of the elders rated the rangeland as being in poor, very
   poor, good or fair condition. We recommend incorporation of broader
   studies of farmers' perceptions in conjunction with scientific analyses
   in order to establish a sound communal-based rangeland development and
   restoration programme.}},

Title = {{Consistent increase in herbivory along two experimental plant diversity
   gradients over multiple years}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Research on the functional importance of biodiversity, motivated by
   global species loss, has documented that plant species richness affects
   many plant-related ecosystem functions. Less is known about the effects
   of plant species richness on functions related to higher trophic levels,
   such as the consumption of biomass by animals, that is, herbivory.
   Previous studies have shown positive, neutral, or negative effects of
   plant species richness on herbivory. In the framework of a grassland
   biodiversity experiment (the Jena Experiment), we investigated herbivory
   (the proportion of leaf area damaged and the amount of leaf biomass
   consumed by arthropod herbivores) along two experimental gradients of
   plant species richness ranging from 1 to 60 species (Main Experiment)
   and from 1 to 8 species (Trait-Based Experiment) biannually for five and
   three years, respectively. Additionally, plant functional diversity,
   based on traits related to plant growth, was manipulated as the number
   of functional groups in a community (Main Experiment) or a gradient of
   functional trait dissimilarity (Trait-Based Experiment). Herbivory at
   the level of plant communities ranged from 0\% to 31\% (0 and 33.8
   g/m(2)) in the Main Experiment and 0\% to 8\% (0 and 13.7 g/m(2)) in the
   Trait-Based Experiment, and it was on average higher in summer than in
   spring. For both experimental gradients and all years investigated, we
   found a consistent increase in damaged leaf area and consumed biomass
   with increasing plant species richness. As mechanistic explanations for
   effects of plant species richness, we propose changes in plant quality
   and herbivore communities. The presence of specific plant functional
   groups significantly affected herbivory, likely related to traits
   affecting plant defense and nutritional value, but we found little
   evidence for effects of plant functional diversity. The general positive
   relationship between plant species richness and herbivory might
   contribute to effects of plant species richness on other ecosystem
   functions such as productivity and nutrient mineralization and can
   cascade up the food web also affecting higher trophic levels.}},

Title = {{Spread of exotic grass in grazed native grass pastures and responses of
   insect communities}},
Journal = {{RESTORATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{539-548}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Exotic grasses are widely established across the Southeastern United
   States for livestock forage, resulting in the structural and
   compositional simplification of grasslands. Replacing exotic forages
   with native warm-season grasses (NWSG) could benefit insects due to
   increased complexity of plant structure and composition, but livestock
   grazing also may facilitate spread of remnant exotic grasses such as
   bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) by reducing height and coverage of NWSG.
   We investigated these relationships among 12 operational-scale pastures
   (6.4-10.5 ha) in Mississippi, U.S.A., during May-July (2011-2012). We
   quantified changes in bermudagrass coverage from one treatment of grazed
   exotic forages and three treatments of recently established NWSG,
   including a grazed mixed NWSG polyculture, a grazed Indian grass
   (Sorghastrum nutans) monoculture to evaluate the effects of stand-type
   richness among NWSG pastures, and a non-grazed NWSG polyculture to
   evaluate the effects of grazing. We also assessed responses of two
   insect orders, Orthoptera and Hemiptera, to treatment and bermudagrass
   coverage. We estimated a 101-190\% average increase in coverage of
   bermudagrass in grazed native grass pastures (NWSG polyculture and
   Indian grass monoculture), but not in non-grazed NWSG, suggesting that
   grazing facilitated the spread of this grass. Composition of Orthopteran
   and Hemipteran communities was correlated with bermudagrass coverage,
   and inter-year differences in composition for both communities in grazed
   mixed NWSG, and for Hemiptera in grazed Indian grass, corresponded with
   increasing bermudagrass coverage in those treatments. Our results
   suggest that incomplete eradication of exotic forages prior to
   establishment of NWSG may be exacerbated by grazing, which could then
   impact stand condition and insect communities.}},

Abstract = {{The key to restoring degraded grassland habitats is identifying feasible
   and effective techniques to reduce the negative impacts of exotic
   species and promote self-sustaining native populations. It is often
   difficult to extend monitoring of restoration efforts to evaluate
   long-term success, but doing so is essential to understanding how
   initial outcomes change over time. To assess how initial treatment
   effects persist, we revisited degraded patches of Pacific Northwest
   prairie habitat 6 years after experimental restoration efforts ceased.
   We evaluated plant community composition to determine the lasting
   effects of supplemental native seeding and disturbance treatments
   (burning, mowing, and herbicide to reduce exotic species). We tracked
   the persistence of seeded species and measured spread of their
   populations to evaluate suitability of species for restoration and the
   ability of the habitat to support native plant populations. We found
   that plots that received supplemental seeding continued to exhibit
   higher richness of native species than those left unseeded, and that
   both seeding and disturbance treatments could positively influence
   native species abundance over the long term. The initially observed
   effects of disturbance treatments on reducing exotic grass abundance had
   diminished, highlighting the importance of long-term monitoring and
   ongoing control of exotic species. Nevertheless, these treatments
   significantly influenced the population trajectories of 4 out of 8
   seeded native species. There was evidence of spatial advance of most
   seeded species. Results from extended monitoring confirm that dispersal
   limitation of native species and difficulties maintaining the reduction
   of exotic grasses continue to be major barriers to success in
   restoration of invaded grasslands.}},

Title = {{Effects of abandonment on plant diversity in semi-natural grasslands

Abstract = {{Questions: What are the effects of abandonment on plant diversity in
   semi-natural grasslands? Do the effects of abandonment on taxonomic and
   functional diversity vary along environmental gradients of climate and
   soil?
   Location: West andmid-Norway.
   Methods: Plant composition was surveyed in 110 subplots of 4 m(2) in 14
   sites across grazed and abandoned semi-natural grasslands. Climate data
   were extracted and soil composition analysed. To reduce the number of
   explanatory variables and deal with collinearity, we performed PCA. Data
   on the plant species vegetative height (H), leaf dry matter content
   (LDMC), specific leaf area (SLA), seedmass (SM) and number of seeds per
   plant (SNP) for 175 species were extracted from the LEDA database.
   Measures of plant diversity (species richness, CWM of functional traits
   and functional diversity (evenness and range)) were calculated for each
   subplot. To estimate the effects of abandonment on plant diversity and
   examine how these effects are moderated by gradients in soil and
   climate, we fitted mixed models to the data including site as a random
   effect.
   Results: Species richness in the subplots was lower in abandoned
   semi-natural grasslands, especially on more calcareous soils. CWM H,
   LDMC and SM were higher in abandoned semi-natural grasslands. CWM LDMC
   was only higher in the driest subplots. The ranges in H, SLA and SM, as
   well as evenness in LDMC were also higher in abandoned semi-natural
   grasslands, but the range in LDMC was lower.
   Conclusions: It is important to assess both taxonomic and functional
   diversity to understand ecosystem processes. The species pool in
   ecosystems influenced by a long history of intermediate grazing includes
   a high proportion of low stature, grazing-tolerant plant species.
   Abandonment of extensive land-use practices will cause a decline in
   taxonomic diversity (plant species richness) in such systems due to
   increased abundance of plants with high stature that outcompete the
   lower, grazing-tolerant plants. This process is predominant especially
   if moisture, soil fertility and pH are at intermediate levels. Changes
   in species communities due to abandonment will also influence ecosystem
   functioning, such as nutrient turnover and fodder production resilience.}},

Title = {{Let native species take their course: Ambrosia artemisiifolia
   replacement during natural or ``artificial{''} succession}},
Journal = {{ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Ambrosia artemisiifolia is able to dominate the early stages of
   vegetation succession in open/disturbed habitats, spreading out into
   available empty niches, after which it can be progressively replaced by
   perennial plants. In this study, we considered the time-span in which
   the species is suppressed during active (restoration actions) and
   passive (spontaneous) vegetation recovery. In particular, we envisaged
   that A. artemisiifolia growth and fitness may be strongly reduced and
   that the species may rapidly be suppressed within a short time during
   succession as a consequence of the increase of vegetation cover, both
   natural or artificially induced, in a disturbed area of northern Italy.
   Three different treatments were applied within an abandoned quarry area
   commonly invaded by A. artemisiifolia: (i) spontaneous succession i.e.
   (control), (ii) hayseed and (iii) a commercial seed mixture. We
   determined the effect of mixtures of grassland species, established from
   native hayseed or from a commercial seed mixture, on A. artemisiifolia
   growth and fitness traits over time in comparison to a non-seeded area
   left to spontaneous succession. The results demonstrated that, after the
   first growing season, compared with spontaneous succession, both
   commercial seed and hayseed resulted in a strong reduction of A.
   artemisiifolia abundance and growth rate, in terms of both vegetative
   and reproductive traits. After the second growing season, A.
   artemisiifolia was completely suppressed in the commercial seed
   treatment, and after the third growing season it was also suppressed in
   the spontaneous succession and hayseed treatments. This study indicated
   that both active and passive vegetation recovery (by niche filling and
   competitive exclusion) could be used as methods individually or in
   combination with other methods, such as mowing and biological control,
   to suppress A. artemisiifolia from anthropogenic habitats. (C) 2017

Title = {{Impacts of farmers' management styles on income and labour under
   alternative extensive land use scenarios}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{168-178}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{High Nature Value farming systems cover a large proportion of the
   agricultural land in marginal and mountain areas of Europe. These large
   areas face environmental, economic and social challenges and formulating
   policies that support all these aspects is difficult. Although farmers
   play an important role in maintaining the ecological diversity of these
   areas, their differing management styles are often not recognised when
   land use policies are formulated. This paper examines these issues using
   an optimisation model based on an extensive livestock farm in Western
   Scotland, where four farmed management styles are combined with a series
   of six alternative future land use scenarios, to provide a more
   realistic and robust insight of policy impacts on land use and habitat,
   labour and farm income. The management styles derived from a typology
   that was based on a composite of both available resources and
   attitudinal components. The six alternative scenarios encompassed
   competitive land use diversification options (woodland and wild deer
   shooting), abandonment of native pasture for agriculture, no support,
   high market prices for livestock products, and increased animal
   efficiency. Although diversification via forestry was found to be
   potentially central to increasing farming incomes, farmers' reticence to
   adopt forestry or any diversification was a major constraint. This case
   study also reinforced that managing livestock on these HNV farming
   systems was not economical unless support subsidies were in place. The
   only scenario which could enhance the HNV biodiversity value on farms
   was one with high market prices, resulting in the most varied land use
   (sheep, cattle and forestry). All others scenarios meant an increase in
   afforestation (which displaced livestock), an increase in livestock
   grazing or abandonment of the land, none of which would maintain
   biodiversity in these areas. Very few scenarios were able to increase
   on-farm labour demand and although greater flexibility in farm labour
   was found to be essential, labour scarcity in these marginal mountain
   areas remained a problem. In conclusion, this case study reinforced that
   farmers' management style and motivation do play a major role on how
   they respond to policies, and unless this role is acknowledged by
   policy-makers, these European HNV areas may not be targeted properly for
   the most desired outcomes and sustainability.}},

Abstract = {{Scientists have largely neglected the effects of grazing on soil
   microbial communities despite their importance as drivers of ecosystem
   functions and services. We hypothesized that changes in soil properties
   resulting from grazing regulate the diversity of soil microbes by
   releasing/suppressing subordinate microbial taxa via competition. To
   test this, we examined how intensity of vertebrate herbivores influences
   the diversity and composition of soil bacteria and fungi at 216 soil
   samples from 54 sites across four microsites. Increasing grazing
   intensity reduced soil carbon, suppressing the dominant bacterial phylum
   Actinobacteria (indirectly promoting bacterial diversity) and increasing
   the dominant fungal phylum Ascomycetes (indirectly reducing fungal
   diversity). Our data provide novel evidence that grazing modulates the
   diversity and composition of soil microbes via increases or reductions
   in competition by dominant taxa. Our results suggest that grazing can
   potentially alter soil function by altering microbial community
   composition, providing a clear link between grazing management, carbon
   availability and ecosystem functions.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural production systems face increasing threats from more
   frequent and extreme weather fluctuations associated with global climate
   change. While there is mounting evidence that increased plant community
   diversity can reduce the variability of ecosystem functions (such as
   primary productivity) in the face of environmental fluctuation, there
   has been little work testing whether this is true for intensively
   managed agricultural systems. Using statistical modeling techniques to
   fit environment-productivity relationships offers an efficient means of
   leveraging hard-won experimental data to compare the potential
   variability of different mixtures across a wide range of environmental
   contexts. We used data from two multiyear field experiments to fit
   climate-soil-productivity models for two pasture mixtures under
   intensive grazing-one composed of two drought-sensitive species
   (standard), and an eight-species mixture including several
   drought-resistant species (complex). We then used these models to
   undertake a scoping study estimating the mean and coefficient of
   variation (CV) of annual productivity for long-term climate data
   covering all New Zealand on soils with low, medium, or high
   water-holding capacity. Our results suggest that the complex mixture is
   likely to have consistently lower CV in productivity, irrespective of
   soil type or climate regime. Predicted differences in mean annual
   productivity between mixtures were strongly influenced by soil type and
   were closely linked to mean annual soil water availability across all
   soil types. Differences in the CV of productivity were only strongly
   related to interannual variance in water availability for the lowest
   water-holding capacity soil. Our results show that there is considerable
   scope for mixtures including drought-tolerant species to enhance
   certainty in intensive pastoral systems. This provides justification for
   investing resources in a large-scale distributed experiment involving
   many sites under different environmental contexts to confirm these
   findings.}},

Abstract = {{1. Semi-natural habitats in Europe host a substantial proportion of
   biodiversity, but they experience biodiversity loss due to ongoing
   agricultural changes. We regard the Rattle grasshopper (Psophus
   stridulus) as a charismatic species of species-rich submontane
   xerothermic grasslands. To enable conservation of the species and its
   habitat, we studied the habitat preferences of this formerly abundant
   grasshopper, now threatened and declining in many European countries.
   2. In 2011, we applied capture-mark-recapture method to sample adults at
   four localities (Czech Republic), each divided into two subplots with
   different management and character of vegetation. In 2012, we carried
   out a more extensive study on habitat preferences, evaluating 179
   grassland patches (24\% of them occupied by P. stridulus). For each
   site, we recorded vegetation characteristics (sward height and density,
   cover of vegetation components, percentage of bare ground), slope,
   inclination and agricultural management. We used multistate models in
   MARK software to analyse survival and movement probabilities between
   different subplots. Data from the 2012 large-scale study were analysed
   by fitting several regression models.
   3. The results show that the species preferred south-facing slopes with
   sparse, short vegetation and with patches of bare ground. Sward density
   was the most important predictor of species presence.
   4. For species conservation, we recommend controlling succession on the
   localities by regular management (grazing or cautious mowing) to
   maintain optimal habitat with sparse sward. We promote P. stridulus as a
   flagship and umbrella species of species-rich submontane xerothermic
   pastures.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of biodiversity on productivity have been well studied in
   the past decades. However, the responses of these biodiversity effects
   to modern grassland managements have not been explicitly tested. By
   establishing a five years diversity-manipulated experiment with
   different cutting frequency and nutrient addition levels, we explored
   the changes of biodiversity effects and the underlying mechanisms under
   these managements. Our results showed that community biomass increased
   with species richness. The correlations were observed under all
   management regimes, but their strengths varied with management
   intensity. The net biodiversity effects (NE) increased with nutrient
   supply, but reduced with frequent cutting. These two factors also
   interactively influenced NE. Importantly, their influences could last 5
   years or longer. The NE changes mainly resulted from the variations of
   complementarity effects (CE), i.e., the aboveground space partitioning
   of our species. However, the selection effects (SE) were minimally
   influenced by nutrient addition and cutting frequency, indicating that
   under these conditions our species had comparably competitive strength.
   Especially, CE increased over time in highly cutting subplots,
   suggesting that this relationship was condition-dependent. We conclude
   that biodiversity is vitally important for ecosystem functioning even
   when the ecosystems are disturbed by human activities, and is most
   effective in enhancing biomass productivity under nutrient supply and
   low cutting frequency conditions. Field studies with species that come
   from other functional groups are needed to draw a more general
   conclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic loss of biodiversity is often indicated by the
   disappearance of top predators. However, some of them have adapted to
   man-made agricultural landscapes. Among raptors, one such example is the
   Lesser Spotted Eagle. We compiled an exhaustive data set on foraging
   habitat composition of this species by direct field mapping and detailed
   land cover maps to study the effect of various agricultural management
   practices on its occupancy of home ranges and productivity, as well as
   on its habitat utilization and hunting success. Home ranges of the
   Lesser Spotted Eagle contained more natural grasslands (7.6\%) and other
   agricultural biotopes (29.9\%) than expected by random, and they
   preferred to breed close to managed agricultural biotopes. They hunted
   preferably on grasslands, where they spent 86\% of their time,
   especially on managed grasslands, but avoided arable fields. In total,
   51\% of the Lesser Spotted Eagle attacks were successful, and we
   detected no differences in hunting success among habitats. Nests of
   successfully breeding birds were surrounded by more crops/cultivated
   grassland on a rotational basis (19.0\%), as well as by managed natural
   grassland (1.1\%), than those of unsuccessful pairs (16 and 0.7\%,
   respectively). We also detected a negative impact of oilseed rape fields
   and mowed cultivated grassland on the reproductive success of the Lesser
   Spotted Eagle, but these effects were not consistent over the years. Our
   results suggest that, although the Lesser Spotted Eagle is well adapted
   to foraging in traditional farmland, it is threatened by changes in
   agricultural practices and an increasing sown area of some crops, such
   as oilseed rape. Cultivation of various crops and retaining of
   grasslands, interspersed with set-aside and non-agricultural habitat
   patches, promoted by the European Union greening policy, would be
   favourable to the Lesser Spotted Eagle.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{327-339}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{QuestionsLivestock grazing and abiotic environmental factors both shape
   grassland systems; however, the relative importance of their impacts on
   plant species composition and soil fertility has rarely been
   investigated. Focusing on Tibetan grasslands, which are of global
   ecological importance and exhibit broad climatic and elevational
   gradients, we asked whether grazing effects are pronounced in humid
   regions, while climate controls are overriding grazing effects in
   semi-arid regions.
   LocationTwenty-eight sites across Tibetan pastures, China; 2820-5150m
   a.s.l.
   MethodsWe used multivariate analyses and generalized linear mixed models
   to examine the effects of livestock activity (hotspots with excessive
   trampling and nutrient input, heavy, moderate and light grazing),
   habitat (meadow, steppe, steppe-meadow) and their interactions. We
   focused on plant species composition, richness and concentrations of
   soil organic carbon (SOC), total N and other plant-available nutrients
   in soils. Major environmental factors were precipitation, temperature
   and elevation. Plant indicator species sensitive to trampling and/or
   grazing were identified.
   ResultsLivestock grazing changed plant species composition and overall
   soil fertility across habitats. However, effects were only pronounced in
   hotspots directly adjacent to herder camps, while differences between
   grazing intensity levels were weak. Heavy grazing favoured annual
   species, reduced concentrations of SOC and total N in meadows. The
   environmental factors that control plant communities and soil condition
   varied among habitats. Plants and soils were more tightly linked in
   steppes and steppe-meadows than in meadows.
   ConclusionsSeveral plant species were identified as frequently and
   reliably present in hotspots of livestock activity, thus are indicative
   of intensive trampling and excess plant available nutrient inputs.
   Overall, plant species composition and soil condition across Tibetan
   pastures were weakly affected by intensified grazing alone compared to
   that shaped by environmental factors. This clearly refutes the broadly
   held perception that increased grazing intensity leads to grassland
   degradation. Such differing and strong abiotic impacts should be
   considered in future grassland management and conservation.}},

Abstract = {{AimsNatural disturbances drive plant assemblages in Afromontane
   grassland. Our aim is to assess how intensity of cattle grazing and time
   since last fire influence plant species richness, dominance and
   assemblage composition.
   LocationCentral Midlands, KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa.
   MethodsSites differed in grazing intensity (light, moderate and heavy)
   and time since last fire: recently burned (RB) vs unburned (UB). We
   sampled plants in 24 vegetation quadrats (1-m(2)) randomly located
   within each site (similar to 1000m(2)). We used linear regression models
   for species richness and dominance, IndVal to identify indicator species
   and CCA for assemblage composition. All analyses were conducted at
   quadrat and site level.
   ResultsSpecies richness was significantly influenced by time since last
   fire (RB>UB), grazing intensity (light < moderate > heavy) and the
   fire-grazing interaction at quadrat level. Dominance reciprocated the
   response of species richness to time since last fire (UB>RB), but did
   not respond consistently to grazing intensity (light > moderate > or <
   heavy). Plant assemblage composition was significantly influenced by
   time since last fire, grazing intensity and vegetation structure (live
   vegetation cover and vegetation height). Indicator species of
   species-poor, heavily grazed sites included alien species, such as
   Cirsium vulgare and Conyza bonariensis.
   ConclusionResponse of species richness to grazing intensity conforms to
   the predictions of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Burning and
   moderate grazing should be part of grassland management. To prevent
   species loss and influx of alien species, heavy grazing should be
   minimized. As development of grassland ecological networks in a timber
   matrix is being pioneered in South Africa, these findings indicate a way
   forward for the management of similar systems elsewhere in the world.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsAre there interspecific differences in resprouting after
   cutting and burning among woody species encroaching temperate
   grasslands? Are alien woody species more successful than natives in
   their resprouting after the two treatments proposed to control shrub
   encroachment? Is resprouting influenced by age of the individuals? Does
   resprouting differ between cutting and burning?
   LocationTemperate grasslands encroached by shrubs, Transylvania,
   Romania.
   MethodsWe investigated the resprouting after cutting or burning of four
   shrub species (Cornus sanguinea, Crataegus monogyna, Prunus spinosa and
   Rosa canina) encroaching grasslands in field sites 3yr following
   treatments. We compared the resprouting ability of shrubs between
   species and treatments and analysed the relationship between the number
   of resprouts and stump diameter, as a proxy for age. In a common garden
   experiment on 1-yr-old individuals we compared resprouting after cutting
   and burning between three native (C.sanguinea, C.monogyna and P.spinosa)
   and three alien woody species (Ailanthus altissima, Elaeagnus
   angustifolia and Hippophae rhamnoides) during one growing season.
   ResultsC.monogyna produced the largest number of resprouts in the field
   study, and H.rhamnoides in the experimental study. Overall, resprouting
   ability of alien woody species did not differ from that of natives. In
   the field study, we found an increasing number of resprouts with
   increasing stump diameter, and the rate of increase in the number of
   resprouts was highest in C.monogyna. We detected no difference in the
   resprouting of woody species between cutting and burning treatments
   either in the field or in the experimental study.
   ConclusionsOur study suggests that the success of encroachment control
   in grasslands does not depend on treatment type, but on the woody
   species composition and age of individuals. Grasslands encroached by
   C.monogyna or H.rhamnoides will be more labour-intensive to restore and
   maintain free of shrubs. Restoration measures should be implemented in
   the early stage of shrub encroachment since younger shrubs have lower
   resprouting ability. Burning and cutting may be equally effective in
   controlling shrub encroachment, but treatments should be more intensive
   than in the current study in order to damage the resprouting buds and
   arrest resprouting.}},

Abstract = {{North American prairies are acknowledged to have evolved with grazing
   following fire. Given this evolutionary fire-grazing interaction, our
   objective was to determine whether seasonal timing of defoliation
   following fire alters subsequent productivity and species composition.
   Following the April 2013 Pautre wildfire in the Grand River National
   Grasslands of South Dakota, we installed exclosures in three locations
   along the border of the fire. Grazing exclosures were paired across the
   fire line to create a burned and nonburned exclosure at each location.
   Four plots were demarcated in each exclosure. Three plots were
   defoliated via mowing to 6 cm either 2, 4, or 6 mo following fire, with
   the fourth maintained as a control. Productivity and species composition
   data were collected in November 2013, June 2014, August 2014, and July
   2015. Fire increased productivity 56\% during the 2013 growing season
   following fire. During the 2014 growing season, there was a tendency for
   burned sites to maintain greater production. June defoliation resulted
   in the greatest current-year productivity in 2014 regardless of fire
   treatment, whereas all other treatments resulted in similar
   productivity. Fire and defoliation effects on productivity were
   undetectable in 2015. Community composition was not affected by fire in
   2013. Melilotus officinalis was increased by spring defoliation in 2014
   and by fire in 2015. Litter was initially reduced by fire but was
   similar to nonburned levels by 2015. Results indicate that positive fire
   effects on productivity are limited to the first two growing seasons
   following fire, whereas defoliation effects manifest the second growing
   season following fire (first growing season after defoliation). With the
   exception of old dead material, fire and timing of defoliation affected
   biomass and community composition independently. Postfire rest from
   grazing appears unnecessary for the maintenance of plant productivity
   and species composition in northern mixed-grass prairie. Published by

Title = {{Economic and conservation implications of converting exotic forages to
   native warm-season grass}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{23-32}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Intensive agriculture can have negative environmental consequences such
   as nonpoint source pollution and the simplification of biotic
   communities, and land sharing posits that conservation can be enhanced
   by integrating agricultural productivity and biodiversity on the same
   land. In the Southeastern United States, native warm-season grasses
   (NWSG) may be a land sharing alternative to exotic forages currently in
   production because of greater livestock gains with lower fertilizer
   inputs, and habitat for grassland birds. However, uncertainty regarding
   costs and risk poses an important barrier to incorporating NWSG in
   livestock operations. We evaluated the economic and conservation
   implications of NWSG conversion among small, operational-scale pastures
   (6.8-10.5 ha) during 2011 -2012 at the Prairie Research Unit in Monroe
   Co., Mississippi (USA). We used partial budgets to compare the marginal
   rate of return (MRRe) from converting exotic grass pastures to either a
   NWSG monoculture of Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans) or a NWSG mix of
   Indiangrass, little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium), and big bluestem
   (Andropogon gerardii). We similarly compared changes in productivity of
   dickcissels (Spiza americana), a grassland bird specializing in tall
   structure. Average daily gain (ADG) of steers and revenue were
   consistently higher for NWSG treatments than exotic grass pasture, but
   ADG declined between years. Indiangrass pastures yielded consistently
   positive MRRe, indicating producers would receive 16-24\% return on
   investment. Marginal rate of return was lower for mixed NWSG (-12 to
   3\%), driven by slightly lower livestock ADG and higher establishment
   costs than for Indiangrass. Sensitivity analyses indicated that MRRe
   also was influenced by cattle selling price. Conversely, mixed NWSG
   increased dickcissel productivity by a greater degree than Indiangrass
   per amount invested in NWSG conversion, suggesting a tradeoff between
   livestock and dickcissel production between the two NWSG treatments.
   Given continued increases in livestock prices, NWSG could be a
   sustainable land sharing alternative to exotic pastures currently in
   production, but subsidies and changes in management may be required for
   NWSG conversion to be viable for producers and to maintain conservation
   benefits. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Drivers of intraspecific trait variation of grass and forb species in
   German meadows and pastures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{705-716}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Questions: To what extent is trait variation in grasses and forbs driven
   by land-use intensity, climate, soil conditions and plant diversity of
   the local neighbourhood? Do grass and forb species differ in the degree
   of intraspecific trait variation?
   Location: Managed grasslands in three regions of Germany.
   Methods: Using a phytometer approach, we raised 20 common European
   grassland species (ten forbs and ten grasses) and planted them into 54
   plots of different land-use types (pasture, meadow, mown pasture). After
   1yr in the field, we measured above- and below-ground plant functional
   traits. Linear mixed effects models (LMEM) were used to identify the
   most powerful predictors for every trait. Variation partitioning was
   applied to assess the amount of inter- and intraspecific trait variation
   in grasses and forbs explained by environmental conditions (land-use
   intensity, climate and soil conditions) and plant species diversity of
   the local neighbourhood.
   Results: For 12 out of the 14 traits studied, either land-use intensity
   or local neighbourhood diversity were predictors in the best LMEM.
   Land-use intensity had considerably stronger effects than neighbourhood
   diversity. Root dry matter content and root phosphorus concentration of
   forbs were more affected by land-use intensity than those of grasses.
   For almost all traits, intraspecific trait variation of grasses was much
   higher than that of forbs, while traits of forbs varied more among
   species. Overall, inter- and intraspecific variation was of the same
   magnitude.
   Conclusion: The similar magnitude of intra- and interspecific trait
   variation suggests that both sources should be considered in grassland
   studies at a scale similar to that of our study. The high amount of
   intraspecific trait variation that was explained by environmental
   factors and local neighbourhood diversity clearly demonstrates the high
   potential of species to adjust to local conditions, which would be
   ignored when only considering species mean trait values.}},

Abstract = {{Patch-burn grazing is a grassland management approach that recouples the
   processes of fire and grazing altering animal distribution and creating
   structural heterogeneity for the benefit of flora and fauna
   biodiversity. Our objective was to investigate the effects of patch-burn
   grazing on plant species composition in tallgrass prairie remnants on
   conservation lands in Missouri. Each grazed unit consisted of three
   patches with each patch approximately one-third the size of the grazed
   unit. We burned a different patch annually and stocked the entire unit
   at a moderate rate of 0.45 AUM/ha with yearling stocker steers. We
   established paired plots of treatment (grazed) and control (grazing
   excluded) and sampled vegetative composition during a 3-yr graze-burn
   cycle and a fourth year of no treatments. Species richness, diversity,
   and floristic quality of exclosures were compared between plots using
   the Shannon, Simpson, and Floristic Quality indices. Our results
   indicated a year x treatment interaction. Specifically, species richness
   and floristic quality were significantly reduced in grazed plots during
   the first growing season post-burn (P < 0.05). However, after the first
   growing season post-burning and focal grazing, grazed plots no longer
   differed in diversity or floristic quality from ungrazed plots. Species
   richness remained elevated in grazed plots beyond the first growing
   season after burning and focal grazing. Species diversity showed no
   significant change in grazed plots throughout the study (P < 0.05) but
   results indicated a similar trend, declining during the first growing
   season post-burn followed by a spike the second year and recovery in
   subsequent years. More research is necessary to understand effects of
   long-term implementation of patch-burn grazing and on individual
   species. Despite the results of a companion study on horizontal
   structure, our results suggest that after one year of intense grazing
   following fire, any changes in vegetative composition were minor to
   nonexistent after three years of patch-burn grazing and one year of rest}},

Abstract = {{Fungi play an important regulating role in terrestrial ecosystem
   functioning. However, their biogeographic distribution patterns along
   combined gradients of plant communities and environmental variables
   across regional spatial scales remain poorly understood. This knowledge
   gap is particularly pronounced in arid and semi-arid grassland
   ecosystems, which occupy one third of the terrestrial surface of China.
   Here, a regional-scale field investigation was conducted to collect soil
   samples from 290 plots at 52 sites along a 4000 km transect in temperate
   grasslands of northern China to assess the distribution patterns of
   fungal communities. The high-throughput Illumina sequencing revealed
   that soil fungal communities were dominated by Ascomycota, Basidiomycota
   and Zygomycota across the temperate grasslands. Fungal richness
   increased with plant species richness and mean annual precipitation
   (MAP). Bray-Cutis dissimilarities in soil fungal community composition
   between sites were significantly correlated with plant community
   composition, geographical distance, and abiotic factors including MAP,
   mean annual temperature, soil pH, and soil organic carbon. Variation
   partitioning analysis revealed that variation in fungal community
   composition was mainly explained by plant community composition,
   followed by geographical distance and abiotic factors. Structural
   equation models further highlighted the significant role of plant
   species richness in determining soil fungal richness. Taken together,
   these results suggest that the regional-scale distribution pattern of
   soil fungal communities is predominantly mediated by plant community
   composition, and also by abiotic factors and geographical distance in
   arid and semi-arid temperate grasslands. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The growing evidence base for the benefits for people and wildlife of
   nature-based solutions to managing urban green infrastructure lacks
   research investigating land manager perspectives on their
   implementation. To address this gap, we explored UK local authority
   manager perceptions of the challenges and opportunities of introducing
   perennial urban meadows to prioritise biodiversity and aesthetics. This
   was co-produced as an experiment in urban greenspaces with Luton Parks
   Service and Bedford Borough Council 2013-15. We conducted semistructured
   interviews with the eight stakeholder managers involved to identify key
   factors impacting on the perceived feasibility of future urban meadow
   establishment in other areas. All managers identified three dominant
   factors (aesthetics and public reaction, locational context, and human
   resources and economic sustainability). Additional factors (local
   politics, communication, biodiversity and existing habitat and physical
   factors) varied in importance according to personal values and
   managerial role. Support for future meadow introduction and a desire to
   overcome the economic challenge of the disposal of meadow arisings were
   related to manager biocentricity. Managers were aware of changing public
   values leading to increasing acceptance of a messier urban aesthetic.
   They perceived perennial meadows as a realistic alternative to amenity
   mown grass that in specific contexts could increase local biodiversity
   and enhance aesthetics if implemented in consultation with the public
   and local councillors. Our findings have relevance for the wider
   implementation of such nature-based solutions to urban GI management:
   Changes in management practice such as the introduction of perennial
   meadows have significant political, strategic, economic and practical
   implications and cannot be viewed purely as a technical challenge.}},

Abstract = {{Plant communities are structured by both competition and facilitation.
   The interplay between the two interactions can vary depending on
   environmental factors, nature of stress, and plant traits. However,
   whether positive or negative interactions dominate in regions of high
   biotic and abiotic stress remains unclear. We studied herbaceous plant
   communities associated with a dwarf shrub Caragana versicolor in
   semi-arid, high altitude Trans-Himalayan rangelands of Spiti, India. We
   surveyed 120 pairs of plots (within and outside shrub canopies) across
   four watersheds differing in altitude, aspect, and dominant herbivores.
   Herbaceous communities within shrub canopies had 25\% higher species
   richness, but similar abundance when compared to communities outside the
   canopy, with the shrub edge having higher diversity than the centre of
   the canopy. Grasses and erect forbs showed positive associations with
   the shrub, while prostrate plants occurred at much lower abundance
   within the canopy. Rare species showed stronger positive associations
   with Caragana than abundant species. Experimental removal of herbaceous
   vegetation from within shrub canopies led to 42\% increase in flowering
   in Caragana, indicating a cost to the host shrubs. Our study indicates a
   robust pattern of a dwarf shrub facilitating local community diversity
   across this alpine landscape, increasing diversity at the plot level,
   facilitating rare species, and yet incurring a cost to hosts from the
   presence of herbaceous plants. Given these large influences of this
   shrub on the vegetation of these high altitude rangelands, we suggest
   that the shrub microhabitat be explicitly considered in any analyses of
   ecosystem health in such rangelands.}},

Abstract = {{Eutrophication has caused strong shifts from perennial seagrass to
   opportunistic macroalgae and phytoplankton in many coastal ecosystems
   worldwide, yet responses of the primary-producer assemblage can vary
   with regional environmental and nutrient-loading conditions. The wider
   consequences of this variable primary-producer response on the
   associated animal community are little known. We used large-scale field
   surveys across 12 study sites with low or high eutrophication levels in
   two geographic provinces in Atlantic Canada to examine region-specific
   responses of macrofauna associated with eelgrass beds. In both regions,
   abundances of all groups increased with eutrophication, but species
   richness of mobile fishes and invertebrates decreased. Generally, filter
   feeders, epibenthic detritivores and some herbivores increased, while
   more hypoxia sensitive species declined. Small fishes and invertebrate
   predators increased with eutrophication mirrored by decreases in their
   prey. Despite similar general trends, our results show distinct shifts
   in species composition in each geographic region associated with
   differences in food availability and predation refuge offered by
   phytoplankton and opportunistic epiphytic or benthic macroalgae as well
   as tolerance to an increasingly hostile physico-chemical environment. So
   far, the continued persistence of eelgrass beds at our ``highly{''}
   eutrophied sites indicates intermediate eutrophication levels with
   short-term benefits for some species. However, the loss of sensitive
   species and decrease in species richness highlight that eutrophication
   has already changed seagrass ecosystems in Atlantic Canada. Our work
   suggests that mitigating these changes will require regional-scale
   management.}},

   simulated climate change for above- or below-ground processes in managed
   grasslands}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Species richness affects processes and functions in many
   ecosystems. Since management of temperate grasslands is directly
   affecting species composition and richness, it can indirectly govern how
   systems respond to fluctuations in environmental conditions. Our aim in
   this study was to investigate whether species richness in managed
   grasslands can buffer the effects of drought and warming manipulations
   and hence increase the resistance to climate change. We established 45
   plots in three regions across Germany, each with three different
   management regimes (pasture, meadow and mown pasture). We manipulated
   spring warming using open-top chambers and summer drought using rain-out
   shelters for 4 weeks.
   Results: Measurements of species richness, above-and below-ground
   biomass and soil carbon and nitrogen concentrations showed significant
   but inconsistent differences among regions, managements and
   manipulations. We detected a three-way interaction between species
   richness, management and region, indicating that our study design was
   sensitive enough to detect even intricate effects.
   Conclusions: We could not detect a pervasive effect of species richness
   on biomass differences between treatments and controls, indicating that
   a combination of spring warming and summer drought effects on grassland
   systems are not consistently moderated by species richness. We attribute
   this to the relatively high number of species even at low richness
   levels, which already provides the complementarity required for positive
   biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships. A review of the
   literature also indicates that climate manipulations largely fail to
   show richness-buffering, while natural experiments do, suggesting that
   such manipulations are milder than reality or incur treatment artefacts.}},

Title = {{Impacts of contrasting conservation grazing management on plants and

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{244}},
Pages = {{22-31}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Calcareous grassland is among the most species rich and diverse habitat
   in Europe, but has faced decline due to agricultural intensification and
   abandonment. In recent years, conservation organisations have changed
   grazing practices in this habitat in an attempt to maintain
   characteristic vegetation. However, there has been little consideration
   of the effects of changes in grazing practices on invertebrate
   communities or their relationship with plant communities. This study
   determines the impacts of commonly used grazing practices in
   internationally rare upland calcareous grasslands on vegetation and on
   carabid beetles, a diverse group that is known to respond to
   environmental change. Typical conservation management regimes (light
   cattle grazing, light sheep grazing and ungrazed), established for over
   ten years, were examined in three regions of Britain. Carabid beetles
   were sampled using pitfall traps from late April early September 2013
   and per cent cover of plant species was recorded in 2 m x 2 m quadrats
   paired with pitfall traps sequentially throughout the sample period.
   Plant and beetle species composition differed significantly between
   regimes, as did plant species richness where ungrazed sites had
   significantly fewer species than sheep or cattle grazed sites. In
   contrast, beetle species richness did not differ by grazing type. Three
   beetle species were significantly associated with grazing management
   regimes: Carabus arvensis with light cattle grazing, and Carabus
   violaceaus and Synchus vivalis with light sheep grazing, the former two
   having undergone major population declines in the UK. Grazing regime
   affects both plant and carabid beetle communities and is important in
   supporting distinct species compositions as well as rare and declining
   species. Carabid beetles did not always respond in the same way as
   plants to grazing regime, suggesting that conservation managers should
   exercise caution when using plant species composition or broad measures
   of plant diversity to indicate biodiversity value, identify priority
   habitats or select grazing regimes to support a particular habitat
   condition.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{244}},

Abstract = {{Alpine meadows have been exposed to relevant management shifts in the
   last decades, with changes in plant species composition and biodiversity
   losses often occurring in favor of augmented foraging capabilities,
   especially in marginal rural contexts. In this study, we analyzed the
   relationships among the plant species composition, biodiversity and
   forage value of meadows and two sets of variables, environmental and
   management ones, in a dairy district of the Central Italian Alps.
   Results indicate that management variables could only explain limited
   variability of the meadows under study: for instance, the number of cuts
   per year is available to justify the plant species composition and
   biodiversity of such coenoses. Moreover, the environmental variables
   better described the variability of responses, due to the harsh
   environmental constraints of the area under examination, located at high
   altitudes. The shared effects of the two sets explained larger variance
   than the management set alone, due to the complex relationships of
   environmental and management factors in the context. The forage value of
   meadows, an indicator of hay quality, was found negatively associated
   with the Shannon Index. This behavior highlights a known dilemma which
   especially refers to high altitude communities as the ones under study,
   clearly highlighting trade-offs between their production and
   biodiversity. Some taxa as Anthriscus sylvestris, Heracleum sphondylium
   and others critically unbalance the species composition of meadows, thus
   their overall biodiversity, at low altitudes. This finding, explainable
   by the late first cuttings commonly adopted by all farmers, suggests the
   eutrophication of coenoses. The management choices inspected did not
   reflect on the wide variability of meadows, but indeed they made
   possible to understand how this farming system should be deeply revised,
   with respect to environmental constraints and meadows' fodder
   capabilities.}},

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A central focus of ecology is identifying the factors that shape spatial
   patterns of species diversity and this is particularly relevant in an
   era of global change. Positive relationships between plant and consumer
   diversity are common, but could be driven by direct responses of each
   trophic level to underlying environmental gradients, or indirectly where
   changes in environmental conditions propagate through food webs. Here we
   use structural equation modeling to examine the relative importance of
   soil resource availability and disturbance (fire) in mediating
   relationships between plant and grasshopper richness in insular
   grasslands. We found a positive relationship between plant and consumer
   richness that became stronger after accounting for disturbance, despite
   unique responses of plants and consumers to the two environmental
   gradients, Plant richness responded to an underlying gradient: in soil
   resource availability. Time since the last fire had a direct positive
   effect on grasshopper richness but had no effect on plant richness. This
   work supports that plant and consumer richness are functionally linked,
   rather than having similar responses to environmental gradients, :By
   disentangling the direct and indirect processes underlying a positive
   :relationship between plant and consumer diversity in a :natural system
   that spans multiple environmental gradients, we demonstrate the
   importance of investigating biodiversity through explicit multivariate
   models. (C) 2017 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing has been practiced in salt marshes in the Wadden Sea
   area since 600 B.C. Currently livestock grazing is also applied for
   conservation management. However, effects of such grazing management on
   salt marshes are likely to vary depending on the species of livestock
   and stocking density due to differences in the behaviour of the animals.
   Yet, little is known about the behaviour of different livestock species
   and stocking densities grazing in salt marshes. We studied the grazing
   behaviour of horses and cattle by focal observation in an experiment
   with four different grazing treatments on a coastal salt marsh. In all
   treatments we recorded diet choice, movement and grazing activity, and
   spatial distribution. Livestock species shared an overlap in diet
   choice. Yet, horses more often foraged on the short grass Puccinellia
   maritima, while the cattle diet contained a higher amount of Aster
   tripolium. Horses travelled longer distances per day and spent more time
   grazing than cattle. Spatial distribution of cattle was significantly
   clustered, while horses showed a random distribution utilizing the whole
   area. Animal behaviour differs between livestock species and stocking
   densities with respect to diet choice, activity and spatial
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{A characteristic butterfly of Asian steppes, Proterebia afra (Fabricius
   1787), was studied in its two relic areas of occurrence within the
   Balkans-the Askion Mts (a single mountain massif in NW Greece) and
   Dalmatia (karstic inland S Croatia)-together with co-occurring butterfly
   communities during its early spring adult flight period. P. afra adults
   tolerate harsh continental conditions prevailing at its localities
   during its flight. Local densities were higher in the Askion Mts (up to
   100 individuals per 50 m walk) than in Dalmatia (up to 30 individuals
   per 50 m). Within both areas of occurrence, it inhabits dry grasslands
   subject to intermediate grazing pressure that retains enough dry grass
   litter but still suppresses shrubs and trees. Hotter slopes are
   preferred in more northerly Dalmatia than in the more southerly Askion
   Mts. More co-occurring butterfly species and more Mediterranean species
   were recorded in the Askion Mts (69 vs 63; 23 vs 12), but more butterfly
   individuals and higher species' richness per transect were observed in
   Dalmatia. In ordination analyses, the main gradients organising the
   grassland butterfly communities distinguished between grassy plains and
   rocky slopes containing more woody plants. Given the distribution
   extents, local densities and present land use conditions, the Balkan P.
   afra is not currently endangered, but this may swiftly change with
   grazing abandonment, especially in Dalmatia, and some conservation
   actions should be considered in the near future.}},

Title = {{Behavioral patterns of (co-)grazing cattle and sheep on swards differing
   in plant diversity}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{191}},
Pages = {{17-23}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Both botanical composition and the presence of additional grazer species
   may modify the grazing efficiency and ingestive behavior of ruminants.
   However, at present, potential effects of interactions between sward
   diversity and presence of multiple animal species on the grazing
   behavior of cattle and sheep are poorly understood. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the effect of mono- or co-grazing of sheep
   and cattle, as well as the influence of sward botanical composition
   (either diverse or grass-dominated swards) on animal behavior patterns
   in a fully factorial design (alpha = 0.05). Sixteen core animals (two
   mono-grazing animals per species on two sward types, plus two co-grazing
   animals per species on two sward types) were observed simultaneously.
   The main behavior (grazing, walking, ruminating/resting) of core animals
   per paddock was recorded repeatedly in scan samplings every ten minutes
   from 6 to 22 h on twelve observation periods distributed over the
   grazing seasons of 2009 and 2010. Four daylight quarters of four hours
   each were differentiated within one observation period. Additionally,
   bites per minute, bites per step and steps per minute were observed 15
   times per core animal on each observation date. Behavioral observations
   showed that cattle decreased the time allocated to grazing in the
   presence of sheep (co-grazing management; P <= 0.036) and
   ruminated/rested longer (P <= 0.023). However, sward botanical
   composition had no effect on cattle behavior (P >= 0.05). In contrast,
   sward botanical composition impacted sheep behavior to a greater degree
   than mono- or co-grazing management (P <= 0.05). Both cattle and sheep
   had a tendency to spend more time grazing and less time
   ruminating/resting towards the end of the day. In cattle, longer grazing
   periods were followed by longer ruminating/resting times, whereas sheep
   varied less in their time spent grazing or ruminating throughout the
   day. Sheep and cattle responded differently in their grazing behavior to
   vegetation composition and grazing management showing a potential of the
   livestock to adapt to a broad range of conditions. The behavior data
   suggests that livestock performance might gain from co-grazing
   management. Cattle and sheep behavior should be considered in planning
   future directions for grassland management and productivity. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Habitat restoration is a key measure to counteract negative impacts on
   biodiversity from habitat loss and fragmentation. To assess success in
   restoring not only biodiversity, but also functionality of communities,
   we should take into account the re-assembly of species trait composition
   across taxa. Attaining such functional restoration would depend on the
   landscape context, vegetation structure, and time since restoration. We
   assessed how trait composition of plant and pollinator (bee and
   hoverfly) communities differ between abandoned, restored (formerly
   abandoned) or continuously grazed (intact) semi-natural pastures. In
   restored pastures, we also explored trait composition in relation to
   landscape context, vegetation structure, and pasture management history.
   Abandoned pastures differed from intact and restored pastures in trait
   composition of plant communities, and as expected, had lower abundances
   of species with traits associated with grazing adaptations. Further,
   plant trait composition in restored pastures became increasingly similar
   to that in intact pastures with increasing time since restoration. On
   the contrary, the trait composition of pollinator communities in both
   abandoned and restored pastures remained similar to intact pastures. The
   trait composition for both bees and hoverflies was influenced by flower
   abundance and, for bees, by connectivity to other intact grasslands in
   the landscape. The divergent responses across organism groups appeared
   to be mainly related to the limited dispersal ability and long
   individual life span in plants, the high mobility of pollinators, and
   the dependency of semi-natural habitat for bees. Our results,
   encompassing restoration effects on trait composition for multiple taxa
   along a gradient in both time (time since restoration) and space
   (connectivity), reveal how interacting communities of plants and
   pollinators are shaped by different trait-environmental relationships.
   Complete functional restoration of pastures needs for more detailed
   assessments of both plants dispersal in time and of resources available
   within pollinator dispersal range.}},

Abstract = {{How species diversity influences ecosystem functioning has been the
   subject of many experiments and remains a key question for ecology and
   conservation biology. However, the fact that diversity cannot be
   manipulated without affecting species composition makes this quest
   methodologically challenging. Here, we evaluate the relative importance
   of diversity and of composition on biomass production, by using partial
   Mantel tests for one variable while controlling for the other. We
   analyse two datasets, from the Jena (2002-2008) and the Grandcour
   (2008-2009) Experiments. In both experiments, plots were sown with
   different numbers of species to unravel mechanisms underlying the
   relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF).
   Contrary to Jena, plots were neither mowed nor weeded in Grandcour,
   allowing external species to establish. Based on the diversity-ecosystem
   functioning and competition theories, we tested two predictions: 1) the
   contribution of composition should increase with time; 2) the
   contribution of composition should be more important in non-weeded than
   in controlled systems. We found support for the second hypothesis, but
   not for the first. On the contrary, the contribution of species richness
   became markedly more important few years after the start of the Jena
   Experiment. This result can be interpreted as suggesting that species
   complementarity, rather than intraspecific competition, is the driving
   force in this system. Finally, we explored to what extent the estimated
   relative importance of both factors varied when measured on different
   spatial scales of the experiment (in this case, increasing the number of
   plots included in the analyses). We found a strong effect of scale,
   suggesting that comparisons between studies, and more generally the
   extrapolation of results from experiments to natural situations, should
   be made with caution.}},

Abstract = {{1. Overgrazing has resulted in widespread decline in biodiversity and
   ecosystem functioning in grasslands world-wide in recent decades.
   However, few studies have examined the patterns and thresholds of
   grazing-induced changes in community structure and ecosystem functioning
   along a grazing gradient and based on species-level responses and plant
   functional traits.
   2. To identify the thresholds of grazing intensity (GI) at both species
   and community levels, we conducted a grazing manipulation experiment
   with seven levels of GI (0-9 sheep ha(-1)) and two topographies (flat
   vs. slope) in a typical steppe. Four plant functional traits were
   measured, including specific leaf area (SLA), plant height, leaf
   nitrogen content (LNC) and stem: leaf ratio.
   3. The threshold of GI that significantly altered community composition
   was at 3.75 sheep ha(-1) for the flat system and 3.0 sheep ha(-1) for
   the slope system. For both flat and slope systems, the threshold GI for
   changes in primary productivity was at 3.0 sheep ha(-1), beyond which
   the productivity decreased substantially.
   4. At the species level, the abundances of common species, most of which
   are perennial grasses, declined at moderate grazing intensities (3.0-4.5
   sheep ha(-1)). The abundances of most rare species, which are perennial
   forbs, declined at low grazing intensities (1.5-3 .0 sheep ha(-1)). SLA
   and LNC are good predictors of species-level responses to grazing. Low
   SLA and high LNC species are negatively affected by high GI, while high
   SLA and low LNC species are little affected by grazing. The negative
   effect of GI on species' abundance was greater in the slope system than
   in the flat system.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that the structural
   and functioning thresholds of grazing intensity depend on plant traits
   and species composition, which is mediated by topographic location.
   These findings, integrating plant functional traits and threshold
   approaches, have important implications for determining sustainable
   grazing intensity in grassland management and biodiversity conservation
   in semi-arid regions.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing and fertilization influence plant species richness through
   multiple pathways, but the exact pathways and their relative
   contributions are unclear. Here, we report on a 3-year field experiment
   on an alpine meadow in which we manipulated grazing and fertilization
   simultaneously to assess their direct and indirect effects on plant
   species richness. Results indicated that both grazing and fertilization
   significantly influenced plant species richness via above- and
   belowground pathways. Specifically, the direct effect of grazing (-0.30,
   effect size) on species richness was negative, mainly due to selective
   feeding. This was comparable, in magnitude, to a positive indirect
   effect of grazing (0.36) on species richness, due to decreased
   aboveground biomass and increased belowground biomass. The direct effect
   of fertilization (-0.34) on species richness was negative, which was
   attributed to the changes of soil pH and available nitrogen; this effect
   was double the indirect effect (-0.16), which largely stemmed from the
   increased aboveground biomass rather than changes in belowground
   biomass. No significant interaction of grazing and fertilization on
   species richness was observed, but the effect of fertilization on
   species richness was masked by the effect of grazing in the combined
   treatment. It was concluded that moderate nitrogen addition (<51.0 kg N
   ha(-1) year(-1)) could increase local pasture productivity while also
   sustaining species richness stability.}},

Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{176-185}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Although the financial returns of game ranching in South Africa have
   been well documented, it is often implicitly assumed that the increased
   transition of lands to game ranching equates to net conservation gains
   in terms of habitat management and biodiversity conservation. As a first
   step towards testing this assumption, we conducted qualitative
   interviews with 28 game ranchers and 10 other key stakeholders in South
   Africa to investigate how ranchers manage habitat on their lands, and
   the degree to which they incorporate ecological advice into their land
   management activities. The purpose of this analysis was to elicit the
   range of views on how game ranching contributes to biodiversity
   conservation, rather than to measure the distribution of ranchers who
   engage in specific stewardship practices. We found that interviewed game
   ranchers engage in several stewardship practices that are consistent
   with sustainable use, namely: control of bush encroachment; removal of
   invasive, exotic plants; erosion control; the use of fire; and active
   management of game to maintain habitat quality. However, these land
   stewardship practices were not uniformly adopted by interviewed
   ranchers, and were not always based on ecological advice. Although our
   results cannot be expanded to the larger game ranching community in
   South Africa, they do suggest that game ranchers would benefit from
   active extension services that provide guidance on biologically
   sustainable land management practices, which would reinforce the
   long-term financial and ecological viability of game ranches.}},

Abstract = {{Dung beetles (Scarabaeidae) are common detritivores, and especially the
   tunnelling genera Geotrupes, Anoplotrupes and Onthophagus enhance the
   soil quality and support nutrient cycles by rapid burial of mammalian
   dung. These functionally important beetles are faced with a wide range
   of anthropogenic disturbances and changes in environmental conditions
   due to land use. We thus conducted quantitative surveys of the abundance
   (converted to total biomass) of dung beetles and their dung removal
   rates (g per two days) in 150 forest and 150 grassland sites with
   varying land-use intensity, located in north-east, central and
   south-west Germany. We used dung from livestock (cow, sheep, horse) and
   game animals (wild boar, red deer and fox) to provide a characteristic
   spectrum of dung resources on each site. Most dung beetle species showed
   habitat preferences: Anoplotrupes, Typhaeus and several Aphodius species
   almost exclusively occurred in forests, while most Onthophagus
   individuals were found in grasslands. In total we collected 18780
   individuals from 33 species. The average dung beetle biomass was 36
   times higher in forests than in grasslands, and their effective dung
   removal rate was 3 times increased. The beetles' total biomass was
   strongly correlated to their removal rates. In forests, the amount of
   wood harvesting significantly reduced dung removal rates by 20\%, and
   mowing frequency (-7\%) and fertilisation (-4\%) had a significant
   negative effect in grasslands. Dung removal by beetles increased with
   grazing intensity (+6\%), however, and was higher in non-native
   coniferous forests (+22\%). Overall, our study demonstrates negative
   effects of habitat conversion from forest to grassland, and negative
   effects of land-use intensity within forests and grasslands on dung
   beetle activities.}},

Abstract = {{Dung beetles highly depend on the ephemeral microhabitat dung which is
   food resource and larval habitat at the same time. Environmental
   conditions surrounding a dung pad, such as vegetation structure, have an
   impact on dung beetle assemblages. We investigated the influence of dung
   conditions and surrounding habitat characteristics on Mediterranean dung
   beetle assemblages in a permanently grazed landscape in northern
   Sardinia. We sampled the dung beetle assemblages of donkey and horse
   dung in three different vegetation types and assessed species richness
   and abundance of dung beetles. Species richness was determined by dung
   and surrounding habitat conditions, whereas abundance was solely
   affected by dung conditions. However, species richness and abundance
   decreased with increasing dung density. The effect of dung density on
   species richness varied depending on vegetation type, with dry grassland
   exhibiting the highest number of dung beetles species at high dung
   density. Species composition in dung pads was influenced by abiotic
   factors with dwellers being negatively affected by increasing dung-pad
   temperature. Our results underline the importance of diverse vegetation,
   particularly with respect to the complexity of vegetation which
   interrelates with the microclimate. Furthermore, our findings illustrate
   the negative effect of high dung densities on dung beetle assemblages,
   suggesting that the degree of the intensity of use by grazing animals is
   important when considering measures for the conservation of dung
   beetles.}},

Abstract = {{Many species adapted to alpine and montane meadow ecosystems are at risk
   of extinction. The skipper Pyrgus ruralis lagunae Scott is a mountaintop
   butterfly restricted to San Diego County, CA, a federally listed
   endangered species, and is in imminent risk of extinction. Historically,
   P. r. lagunae was found in the Laguna and Palomar mountains. We did not
   detect the skipper in the Laguna Mountains, and the species has likely
   been extirpated from this area, which represents half of its historical
   range and is the type locality. We studied three populations on Palomar
   Mountain. Skippers primarily occupied areas close to creeks or in
   adjacent ravines at two nongrazed sites. The third site is grazed by
   cattle, and skippers were found close to the forest edge. At nongrazed
   locations, creek areas had higher cover of intermediate-height
   vegetation, more bare ground, and more flowers compared with unoccupied
   areas of the same meadow. The vegetation at occupied and unoccupied
   areas within the grazed meadow were similar. Even so, skippers occupied
   areas with more bare ground as well as greater species richness of
   flowering plants. A grazing exclosure was previously installed in an
   attempt to protect and enhance skipper habitat, but skippers did not use
   the dense grasslands that developed inside the exclosures. Contrary to
   the prevailing theory, protection from grazing did not improve skipper
   habitat. This illustrates how management based on inadequate biological
   information can hinder well-intentioned conservation efforts.}},

Abstract = {{1. Past management practices may continue to influence ecosystem
   functions and processes for decades, centuries or even longer after they
   have been abandoned. Until now, few researchers have attempted
   experiments which test the effects of restoring some of these past
   management practices on long-term community developmental trajectories.
   2. Strong evidence indicates that the diversity of various taxonomic
   groups declined in European lowland forests in the second half of the
   20th century, following the abandonment of some traditional forest
   management practices. We carried out a five-year field trial in a
   lowland thermophilous oak forest to describe the effects of restoration
   of litter raking and grass cutting on the long-term developmental
   trajectory of species composition and the diversity of understorey
   vegetation. We used target species groups, that is species specific to
   thermophilous forests and dry grassland vegetation and plant functional
   traits to evaluate the restoration success using both compositional and
   functional outcomes.
   3. Dissimilarity in species composition between the managed plots and
   controls increased significantly during the 5 years of the trial. Litter
   raking increased the richness and cover of the thermophilous forest and
   dry grassland species, whereas grass cutting increased the richness and
   cover of only the dry grassland species. We did not record any overall
   trends in divergence of functional trait composition between managed and
   control plots. In the litter raking plots, we recorded increases in
   community-weighted means of specific leaf area, in lateral spread and in
   Ellenberg indicator values for nutrients and soil reaction. In contrast,
   we found little evidence for predictability of species functional trait
   composition subjected to grass cutting.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Following the restoration of traditional
   forest management practices, we were able to change the community's
   developmental trajectory towards higher richness and cover of target
   species. The evaluation of community developmental trajectories using
   species and functional trait composition supports the idea that
   restoration of traditional forest management practices should carefully
   distinguish among possible interventions.}},

Abstract = {{Microbes play a key role in soil nutrient cycling and supply in the
   extensive semiarid grassland ecosystem, where no fertilizers are
   applied. However, the role of fungi vs bacteria in nitrogen (N)
   mineralization in such ecosystem is poorly understood. The objective of
   this study was to determine the impacts of different mowing practices on
   fungal and bacterial communities and the relationships between the two
   microbial communities and net N mineralization rate (R (m)).
   This study was based on a 13-year mowing experiment in Inner Mongolia.
   The treatments included mowing once every second year (M1/2), mowing
   twice every 3 years (M2/3), mowing once a year (M1), mowing twice a year
   (M2), and the unmown (control, CK). Soil basic chemical properties, R
   (m), microbial biomass, bacterial and fungal community abundance, and
   diversity were determined, and fungal phylogeny and the relationship
   between microbial community and R (m) were analyzed.
   Moderate mowing (M1/2, M2/3, and M1) enhanced soil carbon and nitrogen
   stocks, R (m), fungal community abundance and diversity which might
   mainly because of the increased decomposer fungi species, but the higher
   frequency mowing (M2) significantly decreased the above. There was a
   significant correlation between fungal community abundance and R (m) (r
   = 0.688, P = 0.005) in this study. However, different mowing practices
   had little effect on the bacterial community, which might due to human
   disturbance (mowing practices) and poor environmental conditions
   (drought, limited available nitrogen and phosphorus).
   Overall, fungi may play a more important role than bacteria in N
   mineralization under mowing management in such a grassland ecosystem.
   Moderate-frequency mowing, e.g., M1, is more appropriate for maintaining
   soil microbial communities and soil fertility, whereas the
   high-frequency mowing, e.g., M2, is not sustainable for maintaining soil
   nutrients and microbial community in such a semiarid grassland ecosystem
   in a long term.}},

Abstract = {{Proposed strategies to protect biodiversity within agricultural systems
   are often based on botanical criteria with plant species richness
   generally considered the prime indicator of conservation potential.
   While wet grasslands dominated by rushes (Juncus spp.) are commonly
   considered to be of lesser ecological value than those which are more
   botanically diverse (e.g. Carex dominated wet grasslands), their value
   for invertebrates such as Diptera has not yet been fully explored. Data
   from two Diptera families (Sciomyzidae and Syrphidae) were examined at
   spatial, temporal and spatiotemporal scales to determine the
   contribution of two different (Juncus and Carex dominated) wet grassland
   habitats towards the maintenance of Diptera diversity. The two habitats
   were significantly different in terms of community structure for both
   families and temporal variation was a significant component of dipteran
   diversity. Spatiotemporal analysis showed that species turnover between
   habitats at different times made the most significant contribution to
   overall Diptera diversity. Temporal variation of both families suggests
   that the relative importance of each habitat type to overall diversity
   fluctuates depending on sampling period, with both habitats supporting
   diversity at different times. Our results indicate that lowland wet
   grasslands characterised by Juncus cover need to be recognised as
   ecologically important for the maintenance of dipteran diversity. We
   discuss the possible implications for the diversity of Diptera in wet
   grasslands if these commonly perceived marginal areas (both
   agriculturally and ecologically) are ignored in conservation strategies.
   The necessity of recognising spatiotemporal variation when evaluating
   habitats using invertebrates as indicators is also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The grassland ecosystem is a significantly important terrestrial carbon
   pool. Intensive mowing is common to meet the need of increased
   livestock. However, little information on the quality and quantity of
   soil organic matter (SOM) under different mowing managements has been
   documented. In this work, in order to evaluate the impacts of different
   mowing managements on the quality and quantity of SOM, the fractions and
   chemical composition of SOM under different mowing managements were
   determined using traditional fractionation methods and spectroscopy
   technologies, including advanced nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (e.g.
   cross-polarization magic angle spinning C-13-NMR, CPMAS 13C-NMR) and
   Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) based on a 13-year field mowing trial
   with four treatments: unmown (M0), mowing once every second year (M1/2),
   mowing once a year (M1) and mowing twice a year (M2). The results showed
   that compared with M0, M1/2 and M1 significantly enhanced the SOM
   accumulation and increased the stability of SOM by enhancing
   humification, while M2 limited SOM accumulation and microbial biomass.
   Substituted alkyl carbon (C) was the major organic C type in the
   grassland ecosystem, and it made up over 40\% of the total C. M1/2 and
   M1 significantly increased stable C functional groups (alkyl C and
   aromatic C) by degrading labile C functional groups (O-alkyl and
   carbonyl C) and forming recalcitrant humus, while M2 had opposite
   effects. The consistent increase in the values of NMR indices reflecting
   the degradation degree, hydrophobicity and aromaticity of SOM in M1
   reflected the fact that M1 had the largest contribution to increasing
   the stability of SOM, while these values in M2 were similar to those in
   M0. Significant correlations between different SOM fractions and
   nitrogen (N) mineralization, and between the contents of different C
   functional groups and net soil organic nitrogen mineralization or
   microbial biomass C, indicated that the shifts in SOM fractions and
   chemical composition were closely related to soil microbial biomass and
   activity. Therefore, in view of the quality and quantity of SOM and the
   sustainable development of grassland ecosystems, M1 was the optimal
   mowing management, while M2 should be avoided in the semiarid grassland.}},

   Plant-Community Composition in Species-Rich Annual Vegetation along a

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural land use imposes a major disturbance on ecosystems
   worldwide, thus greatly modifying the taxonomic and functional
   composition of plant communities. However, mechanisms of community
   assembly, as assessed by plant functional traits, are not well known for
   dryland ecosystems under agricultural disturbance. Here we investigated
   trait responses to disturbance intensity and availability of resources
   to identify the main drivers of changes in composition of semiarid
   communities under diverging land use intensities. The eastern
   Mediterranean study region is characterized by an extended rainless
   season and by very diverse, mostly annual communities. At 24 truly
   replicated sites, we recorded the frequency of 241 species and the
   functional traits of the 53 most common species, together with soil
   resources and disturbance intensity across a land use gradient ranging
   from ungrazed shrubland to intensively managed cropland (six land use
   types). Multivariate RLQ analysis (linking functional traits, sites and
   environmental factors in a three-way ordination) and fourth corner
   analysis (revealing significant relations between traits and
   environmental factors) were used in a complementary way to get insights
   into trait-environment relations. Results revealed that traits related
   to plant size (reflecting light absorption and competitive ability)
   increased with resource availability, such as soil phosphorus and water
   holding capacity. Leaf economic traits, such as specific leaf area
   (SLA), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), and leaf dry matter content showed
   low variation across the disturbance gradient and were not related to
   environmental variables. In these herbaceous annual communities where
   plants grow and persist for just 3-5 months, SLA and LNC were unrelated,
   which together with relatively high SLA values might point to strategies
   of drought escape and grazing avoidance. Seed mass was high both at
   higher and lower resource availability, whereas seed number increased
   with the degree of disturbance. The strong response of size and
   reproduction traits, and the missing response of leaf economic traits
   reveal light interception and resource competition rather than resource
   acquisition and litter decomposition as drivers of plant community
   composition. Deviations from trait relationships observed in commonly
   studied temperate ecosystems confirm that climatic conditions play a
   fundamental role by filtering species with particular life forms and
   ecological strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Fire shapes biome distribution and community composition worldwide, and
   is extensively used as a management tool in flammable landscapes. There
   is growing concern, however, that fire could increase the vulnerability
   of native fauna to invasive predators. We developed a conceptual model
   of the ways in which fire could influence predator-prey dynamics. Using
   a before-after, control-impact experiment, we then investigated the
   short-term effects of a prescribed fire on 2 globally significant
   invasive mesopredators (red fox, Vulpes vulpes, and feral cat, Felis
   catus) and their native mammalian prey in a fire-prone forest of
   southeastern Australia. We deployed motion-sensing cameras to assess
   species occurrence, collected predator scats to quantify diet and prey
   choice, and measured vegetation cover before and after fire. We examined
   the effects of the fire at the scale of the burn block (1,190 ha), and
   compared burned forest to unburned refuges. Pre-fire, invasive predators
   and large native herbivores were more likely to occur at sites with an
   open understory, whereas the occurrence of most small- and medium-sized
   native mammals was positively associated with understory cover. Fire
   reduced understory cover by more than 80\%, and resulted in a 5-fold
   increase in the occurrence of invasive predators. Concurrently, relative
   consumption of medium-sized native mammals by foxes doubled, and
   selection of long-nosed bandicoots (Perameles nasuta) and short-beaked
   echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus) by foxes increased. Occurrence of bush
   rats (Rattus fuscipes) declined. It was unclear if fire also affected
   the occurrence of bandicoots or echidnas, as changes coincided with
   normal seasonal variations. Overall, prescribed fire promoted invasive
   predators, while disadvantaging their medium-sized native mammalian
   prey. Further replication and longer-term experiments are needed before
   these findings can be generalized. Nonetheless, such interactions could
   pose a serious threat to vulnerable species such as critical weight
   range mammals. Integrated invasive predator and fire management are
   recommended to improve biodiversity conservation in flammable
   ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Land management influences trade-offs and the total supply of ecosystem
   services in alpine grassland in Tibet, China}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{193}},
Pages = {{70-78}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Developing sustainable use patterns for alpine grassland in Tibet is the
   primary challenge related to conserving these vulnerable ecosystems of
   the `world's third pole' and guaranteeing the well-being of local
   inhabitants. This challenge requires researchers to think beyond the
   methods of most current studies that are limited to a single aspect of
   conservation or productivity, and focus on balancing various needs. An
   analysis of trade-offs involving ecosystem services provides a framework
   that can be used to quantify the type of balancing needed. In this
   study, we measured variations in four types of ecosystem services under
   five types of grassland management including grazing exclusion, sowing,
   combined plowing and grazing exclusion, combined plowing and sowing, and
   natural grassland, from 2013 to 2015. In addition, we accessed the
   existence and changing patterns of ecosystem service trade-offs using
   Spearman coefficients and a trade-off index. The results revealed the
   existence of trade-offs among provisioning and regulating services.
   Plowing and sowing could convert the trade-off relationships into
   synergies immediately. Grazing exclusion reduced the level of trade-offs
   gradually over time. Thus, the combined plowing and sowing treatment
   promoted the total supply of multiple ecosystem services when compared
   with natural grassland. We argue that the variations in dry matter
   allocation to above and belowground serve as one cause of the variation
   in trade-off relationships. Another cause for variation in trade-offs is
   the varied species competition between selection effects and niche
   complementarity. Our study provides empirical evidence that the effects
   of trade-offs among ecosystem services could be reduced and even
   converted into synergies by optimizing management techniques. (C) 2017

Title = {{Impacts of carbon nanomaterials on the diversity of microarthropods in
   turfgrass soil}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 11}},
Abstract = {{Nanoscale materials have been produced with unprecedented speed due to
   their widespread use, and they may eventually be released into the
   environment. As effective adsorbents for heavy metals, carbon
   nanomaterials can be used to immobilize metals in contaminated soil, but
   little information is available regarding their effects on soil
   microarthropods. This study was designed to investigate the influence of
   three types of carbon nanomaterials, graphene (G), graphene oxide (GO)
   and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on soil microarthropod communities under
   turfgrass growth conditions. The application of carbon nanomaterials
   resulted in increased abundance of all soil microarthropods, especially
   in the GO and CNT treatments. GO also significantly increased the
   abundances of multiple trophic functional groups, including predators,
   detritivores, herbivores and fungivores. Further, the dominant genera
   varied among the treatments. Herbivorous microarthropods predominated in
   the control, whereas predatory species predominated in the carbon
   nanomaterial treatments. Carbon nanomaterials also increased the total
   taxonomic richness, Shannon diversity index, and dominance index of the
   microarthropod community, but they decreased the evenness index. Higher
   diversity of soil microarthropods indicates an environment suitable for
   soil mesofauna and for enhanced decomposition and nutrient cycling in
   the soil food web.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},

Abstract = {{The invasive macroalgal species Avrainvillea sp. and native species
   Halimeda kanaloana form expansive meadows that extend to depths of 80 m
   or more in the waters off of O'ahu and Maui, respectively. Despite their
   wide depth distribution, comparatively little is known about the biota
   associated with these macroalgal species. Our primary goals were to
   provide baseline information on the fish fauna associated with these
   deep-water macroalgal meadows and to compare the abundance and diversity
   of fishes between the meadow interior and sandy perimeters. Because both
   species form structurally complex three-dimensional canopies, we
   hypothesized that they would support a greater abundance and diversity
   of fishes when compared to surrounding sandy areas. We surveyed the fish
   fauna associated with these meadows using visual surveys and collections
   made with clove-oil anesthetic. Using these techniques, we recorded a
   total of 49 species from 25 families for H. kanaloana meadows and
   surrounding sandy areas, and 28 species from 19 families for
   Avrainvillea sp. habitats. Percent endemism was 28.6\% and 10.7\%,
   respectively. Wrasses (Family Labridae) were the most speciose taxon in
   both habitats (11 and six species, respectively), followed by gobies for
   H. kanaloana (six species). The wrasse Oxycheilinus bimaculatus and
   cardinalfish Apogonichthys perdix were the most frequently-occurring
   species within the H. kanaloana and Avrainvillea canopies, respectively.
   Obligate herbivores and food-fish species were rare in both habitats.
   Surprisingly, the density and abundance of small epibenthic fishes were
   greater in open sand than in the meadow canopy. In addition, species
   richness was also higher in open sand for Avrainvillea sp. We
   hypothesize that the dense holdfasts and rhizoids present within the
   meadow canopy may impede benthic-dwelling or bioturbator species, which
   accounted for 86\% and 57\% of individuals collected in sand adjacent to
   H. kanaloana and Avrainvillea sp. habitats, respectively. Of the 65
   unique species recorded in this study, 16 (25\%) were detected in clove
   oil stations alone, illustrating the utility of clove-oil anesthetic in
   assessing the diversity and abundance of small-bodied epibenthic fishes.}},

Abstract = {{To maintain European semi-natural grasslands, agri-environment schemes
   (AES) have been established in many countries but their biodiversity
   benefits have remained limited. We tested the effects of three new
   mowing regimes designed to benefit biodiversity in extensively managed
   meadows across the Swiss lowlands. Our experimental treatments mimicked
   easily implementable farming practices. We previously showed that
   invertebrates benefit from delayed mowing and leaving an uncut grass
   refuge. Here we focus on the effects on plant and bryophyte communities.
   We compared the standard AES practice (earliest mowing on June 15, no
   fertilizer input, but no restriction on number of cuts) to three
   alternative mowing regimes: (i) earliest mowing delayed by one month,
   (ii) maximum of two cuts per year with at least eight weeks in between,
   and (iii) leaving an uncut refuge on 1020\% of the meadow area in 12
   study areas in the Swiss lowlands. We also tested for the interactive
   effects of ambient temperature, precipitation, elevation, meadow size,
   local forest cover, time since AES registration, and phytomass
   production.
   After five years of application, we found no difference in the effects
   of mowing regimes on vascular plant or bryophyte species richness,
   community composition, phytomass, flowering phenology or average plant
   height (the latter two indices were derived from the literature).
   However, cutting frequency and hay nutritional quality (C:N and Ca:P
   ratios) were lower under delayed mowing. Vascular plant and bryophyte
   species richness as well as forage quality were negatively related to
   phytomass, while the latter was positively related to mean summer
   temperature and negatively to time since AES registration.
   We conclude that supporting invertebrate biodiversity with alternative
   mowing regimes has no detrimental effects on the vascular plants and
   mosses, while the reduced forage quality calls for additional financial
   compensation of the farmers adopting these agri-environment schemes.}},

   managed grasslands?}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{40-50}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Plant diversity and land-use intensity have been shown to affect
   invertebrate herbivory. Several hypotheses predict positive (e.g.
   associational susceptibility) or negative (e.g. associational
   resistance) relationships of herbivory with plant species richness.
   Also, the strength and direction of reported relationships vary greatly
   between studies leading to the conclusion that relationships either
   depend on the specific system studied or that other unconsidered factors
   are more important. Here, we hypothesized that plant phylogenetic
   diversity is a stronger predictor of invertebrate herbivory than plant
   species richness because it integrates additional information about the
   phenotypical and functional composition of communities. We assessed the
   community-wide invertebrate herbivory, plant species richness and
   phylogenetic diversity across a range of land-use intensities including
   a total of 145 managed grasslands in three regions in Germany.
   Increasing land-use intensity decreased plant species richness and
   phylogenetic diversity. Plant species richness did not predict
   invertebrate herbivory. By contrast herbivory moderately increased with
   increasing plant phylogenetic diversity even after accounting for the
   effects of region and land use. The strength of direct effects of
   land-use intensity and indirect effects via altered phylogenetic
   diversity on herbivory, however, varied among regions. Our results
   suggest that increasing phylogenetic diversity of plant communities
   increases invertebrate herbivory probably by providing higher resource
   diversity. Differences between regions underline the need to account for
   regional peculiarities when attempting to generalize land-use effects on
   invertebrate herbivory. (C) 2017 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by

Abstract = {{1 The large-scale cultivation of crops may lead to biodiversity
   decreases as a result of habitat loss and degradation of natural
   habitats. Apopular strategy for enhancing insect diversity in
   intensively cultivated habitats involves maintaining plant diversity in
   field margins by means of sown grass and wildflower strips.
   2 Despite extensive cultivation of maize/corn (approximately 3.1 million
   ha) in the grassy biomes of South Africa, little effort has been made to
   understand whether plant groups maintain insect biodiversity within
   these agro-ecosystems.
   3 The diversity relationships between three prominent guilds of
   arthropods (herbivores, parasitoids and predators) and three large plant
   families (Asteraceae, Fabaceae and Poaceae) are described at regional
   scale across the Grassland and Savanna Biomes of South Africa.
   4 The results obtained indicate general positive relationships between
   plant and arthropod diversity of the lower vegetation layers (<= 2 m).
   5 An increased abundance of members of the grass family (Poaceae) led to
   significantly higher invertebrate numbers in maize fields and adjacent
   vegetation. This suggests that grasses play a significant role in
   supporting arthropod diversity within these agro-ecosystems.
   6 When considering farm design in maize-agro-ecosystems, our results
   indicate that maintaining grassy natural vegetation patches adjacent to
   actively cultivated maize fields may be sufficient to maintain and
   conserve arthropod diversity within agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the responses of vegetation characteristics and soil
   properties to grazing disturbance is useful for grassland ecosystem
   restoration and management in semiarid areas. Here, we examined the
   effects of long-term grazing on vegetation characteristics, soil
   properties, and their relationships across four grassland types (meadow,
   Stipa steppe, scattered tree grassland, and sandy grassland) in the
   Horqin grassland, northern China. Our results showed that grazing
   greatly decreased vegetation cover, aboveground plant biomass, and root
   biomass in all four grassland types. Plant cover and aboveground biomass
   of perennials were decreased by grazing in all four grasslands, whereas
   grazing increased the cover and biomass of shrubs in Stipa steppe and of
   annuals in scattered tree grassland. Grazing decreased soil carbon and
   nitrogen content in Stipa steppe and scattered tree grassland, whereas
   soil bulk density showed the opposite trend. Long-term grazing
   significantly decreased soil pH and electrical conductivity EC) in
   annual-dominated sandy grassland. Soil moisture in fenced and grazed
   grasslands decreased in the following order of meadow, Stipa steppe,
   scattered tree grassland, and sandy grassland. Correlation analyses
   showed that aboveground plant biomass was significantly positively
   associated with the soil carbon and nitrogen content in grazed and
   fenced grasslands. Species richness was significantly positively
   correlated with soil bulk density, moisture, EC, and pH in fenced
   grasslands, but no relationship was detected in grazed grasslands. These
   results suggest that the soil carbon and nitrogen content significantly
   maintains ecosystem function in both fenced and grazed grasslands.
   However, grazing may eliminate the association of species richness with
   soil properties in semiarid grasslands.}},

Title = {{Evidence of extinction debt through the survival and colonization of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{464-474}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Aims: There is a time lag between loss of semi-natural grassland and a
   reduction of population size that leads to the extinction of grassland
   plant specialists; thus, current species richness in the grassland may
   include an extinction debt'. However, previous studies have not tried to
   detect the presence of an extinction debt from individual species loss
   and colonization rates in an assemblage of plant species. In addition,
   few researchers have studied extinction debt using factors other than
   landscape changes {[}e.g. the impacts of management (mowing or burning),
   habitat use by large herbivores or climate factors]. In the present
   study, we examined an extinction debt for vascular plant species by
   monitoring their survival and colonization dynamics.
   Location: Abandoned and managed semi-natural grasslands, central Japan,
   where the area of grasslands has decreased considerably.
   Methods: We re-surveyed species compositions in the 2000s in plots that
   had been surveyed in the 1980s, and estimated the impacts of the past
   (1910s) and recent (1980s-2000s) proportion of the total grassland area
   and the above-mentioned factors on species dynamics during the past
   20yrs using hierarchical Bayesian models.
   Results: In abandoned grasslands, the past grassland proportion was
   significantly positively associated with the probabilities of survival
   of 96\% of the grassland specialists and of colonization by 21\% of
   these specialists. The effects of the past grassland proportion on the
   specialists were much stronger than those of recent grassland proportion
   and the other factors studied (i.e. herbivores, climate). In managed
   grasslands, however, the past grassland proportion had little effect on
   survival of and colonization by specialists from the result that few
   specialists were significantly affected by past grassland proportion.
   Conclusions: We found higher probabilities of both survival of and
   colonization by grassland specialists at sites with larger past habitat
   areas, which suggests that there is a time lag after habitat loss before
   the loss of specialists. In addition, we found that continuous
   management inhibits payment of the extinction debt created by the
   habitat loss.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Do the effects of grazing and fertilization on taxonomic and
   functional diversity follow the dynamic equilibrium model?
   Location: Long-term permanent upland grasslands, Massif-central, France.
   Methods: Over 8yr, we monitored vegetation changes in 24 experimental
   plots in two productive grasslands after modification of grazing
   intensity (including abandonment) or fertilization regime (including
   cessation of fertilization). Botanical surveys and plant trait
   measurements (LDMC, SLA and reproductive plant height) were performed
   within each plot. We analysed taxonomic responses using PRC and
   functional responses from observed temporal changes of CWM traits and
   Rao index.
   Results: Grazing abandonment led to significant reductions in species
   richness and functional convergence toward taller plants with higher
   LDMC in both grasslands. Intermediate and high grazing pressure did not
   differ but showed strong variations in taxonomic diversity between
   years. Changes in functional vegetation structure were mostly driven by
   species turnover and weakly influenced by intraspecific trait
   variability. Community responses to modified fertilization regime were
   more complex, with strong differences between the two mown grasslands.
   Species richness did not change significantly although species evenness
   decreased in the highly fertilized treatments (NPK), particularly in the
   most productive grassland. Here, functional changes were largely driven
   by intraspecific trait variability. Both functional divergence and
   convergence were found for different traits. In NPK, grassland
   assemblages converged toward taller plants while SLA diverged.
   Conclusions: In our upland study system the different components of
   grassland diversity responded differently, in terms of direction or rate
   of change and mostly under extreme modifications of management.
   Following abandonment, the observed patterns suggest a prominent and
   consistent role of competitive exclusion, as expected under the DEM.
   However, our findings also suggest the role of additional processes,
   especially the importance of niche differentiation, for our mown
   grassland under NPK. Timing and net effects of these combined assembly
   drivers were sensitive to even slight differences in initial
   productivity and species composition.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by livestock supports millions of people worldwide, particularly
   in drylands, but has marked negative effects on ecosystem services and
   functions. In Australia, its effects on ecosystem services have not been
   fully quantified. We examined the extent to which grazing by livestock
   influenced supporting (productivity, habitat for organisms and
   biodiversity) and regulating (carbon cycling and hydrological function)
   services, using data from published and unpublished studies on livestock
   grazing from a large number of sites across Australia. Grazing reduced
   our measure of supporting services by about 20\% and regulatory services
   by 8\%. On average, grazing reduced plant productivity by 40\%, habitat
   value by 20\%, and biodiversity, hydrological function and carbon
   sequestration by about 10\%. Habitat and productivity showed strong
   declines with increasing grazing intensity, and carbon showed strong
   declines at the lowest and highest contrasts. Hydrological function and
   biodiversity did not decline with increasing grazing intensity. Overall,
   the results indicate that livestock grazing leads to substantial
   degradation at a continental scale by reducing ecosystem services
   associated with habitat provision, biodiversity, and soil and water
   functions. Management of livestock grazing will be critical if we are to
   retain functional levels of ecosystem services into the next century.

Abstract = {{Large grazing animals can have profound impacts on plant communities and
   soil properties; however, these impacts are not always uniform across or
   within regions. The distribution of features such as forage quality,
   water, or shade within a pasture can change the behavior of grazers and
   thus, the impact of their grazing. Where managed livestock grazing has
   been proposed as a conservation tool to enhance or maintain desirable
   plant communities, understanding how spatial variation between tree and
   intertree habitats within a savanna landscape affects the response of
   vegetation and soil properties to grazing will be critical for designing
   management plans for different sites. In this study, we used a
   previously established, long-term livestock grazing experiment in
   California oak {[}Quercus L.] savannas to investigate how the removal of
   grazing affected plant communities and soil characteristics underneath
   and outside of isolated tree canopies. In the oak understory, plant
   community composition shifted in response to livestock removal, largely
   due to a 68-400\% increase in the relative cover of native species.
   Overall plant community composition in open grassland neighboring trees
   changed little in response to livestock grazing removal, yet we did see
   a decrease in species richness and diversity surrounding deciduous oaks
   as the dominance of the exotic annual Bromus diandrus Roth increased.
   The depth of plant litter increased 1 2 cm in both habitat types when
   livestock grazing was absent, along with minor changes in soil carbon,
   nitrogen, and bulk density. These results highlight how different
   habitat patches within savanna landscape can have varying responses to
   grazing removal and illustrate how challenging it will be to use grazing
   as a management tool to enhance the diversity of native species. In the
   oak understory, native species that are tolerant of herbivory may be
   absent or unable to coexist with non-native annual grasses. The
   abundance of understory habitat at a particular site may therefore be an
   important variable predicting the outcome of livestock grazing. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Open landscapes in many parts of Europe have been negatively affected by
   large-scale drainage and amelioration to support agricultural
   production. In continental alkali grasslands, amelioration and
   establishment of drainage ditch systems were typical in the 1950s and
   60s. Drainage ditches caused a considerable fragmentation and
   degradation of natural grasslands; thus several projects aimed at
   eliminating these linear landscape elements. In a multi-site study, we
   explored the drivers of grassland recovery after soil-filling of
   drainage ditches in landscape-scale restoration projects in Hortobagy
   National Park, East-Hungary. Ditch embankments, formerly built from the
   excavated soil, were used to fill the 8-m wide ditches and grazing was
   applied to facilitate the recovery of grasslands similar to the
   surrounding matrix. Three age classes were selected for the study: 1-,
   6- and 8-year-old filled ditches; with nine sites per age group,
   surrounded by three grassland types (27 ditches in total). We recorded
   the percentage cover of vascular plant species in 18 plots per ditch,
   486 plots in total. We found that the species pool of the filled ditches
   became more similar to the reference grasslands with increasing
   successional age and increasing distance to the central zone of the
   ditches regardless of grassland type. Species richness of the filled
   ditches became more similar to that of the reference grasslands with
   increasing successional age. However, we found that several target
   species, especially salt-tolerant pioneers, could establish even in the
   first year. Grassland recovery was most successful in sites adjacent to
   dry grasslands characterised by soils with high salt content, which
   favoured specialist species and suppressed non-target species. Cover of
   non-target species was higher in wet meadows with moist, nutrient-rich
   soils which favoured generalists and non-target species. Our study
   revealed that passive restoration after soil filling of disused drainage
   ditches can effectively support grassland recovery even within less than
   ten years, when restoration sites are surrounded by natural grasslands.

Abstract = {{Variations of plant biomass and plant species diversity in relation to
   plateau pika densities in alpine meadow steppe of the Qinghai-Tibet
   Plateau China were investigated. Peak above-and below-ground biomass,
   botanical composition, and soil moisture were measured and from these
   species and functional diversity indices were calculated with reference
   to pika burrow densities, biomass and soil moisture. Biomass components
   generally decreased with increased pika burrow density. Biomass of
   sedges and forbs increased whereas aboveground biomass of grasses first
   increased and then decreased as burrow density increased. There were
   positive linear relationships between aboveground biomass and both
   species and functional group richness and diversity, and also between
   soil moisture and these indices. These results are relevant to
   considerations of whether plateau pika is a pest or is a key species in
   maintaining the ecological stability and biodiversity of its indigenous
   habitat. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effects of plant diversity on the concentration of secondary plant

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{647-660}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. The diversity of the surrounding plant community can directly affect
   the abundance of insects on a focal plant as well as the size and
   quality of that focal plant. However, to what extent the effects of
   plant diversity on the arthropod community on a focal plant are mediated
   by host plant quality or by the diversity of the surrounding plants
   remains unresolved.
   2. In the field, we sampled arthropod communities on focal Jacobaea
   vulgaris plants growing in experimental plant communities that were
   maintained at different levels of diversity (one, two, four or nine
   species) for 3 years. Focal plants were also planted in plots without
   surrounding vegetation. We recorded the structural characteristics of
   each of the surrounding plant communities as well as the growth, and
   primary and secondary chemistry (pyrrolizidine alkaloids, PAs) of the
   focal plants to disentangle the potential mechanisms causing the
   diversity effects.
   3. Two years after planting, the abundance of arthropods on focal plants
   that were still in the vegetative stage decreased with increasing plant
   diversity, while the abundance of arthropods on reproductive focal
   plants was not significantly affected by the diversity of the
   neighbouring community. The size of both vegetative and reproductive
   focal plants was not significantly affected by the diversity of the
   neighbouring community, but the levels of PAs and the foliar N
   concentration of vegetative focal plants decreased with increasing plant
   diversity. Structural equation modelling revealed that the effects of
   plant diversity on the arthropod communities on focal plants were not
   mediated by changes in plant quality.
   4. Synthesis. Plant quality can greatly influence insect preference and
   performance. However, under natural conditions, the effects of the
   neighbouring plant community can overrule the plant quality effects of
   individual plants growing in those communities on the abundance of
   insects associated to this plant.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims The occurrence of drought-induced forest die-off
   events is projected to increase in the future, but we still lack
   complete understanding of its impact on plant-soil interactions, soil
   microbial diversity and function. We investigated the effects of holm
   oak (Quercus ilex) decline (HOD) on soil microbial community and
   functioning, and how these effects relate to changes in the herbaceous
   community.
   Methods We selected 30 holm oak trees with different defoliation degrees
   (healthy, affected and dead) and analyzed soil samples collected under
   the canopy (holm oak ecotype) and out of the influence (grassland
   ecotype) of each tree.
   Results HOD increased potential nitrogen (N) mineralization and
   decreased inorganic N concentrations. These results could be partially
   explained by changes in the herbaceous composition, an increased
   herbaceous abundance and changes in soil microbial functional diversity
   and structure, with HOD favoring bacteria against fungi. Moreover,
   herbaceous abundance and microbial functional diversity of holm oak and
   grassland ecotypes converged with HOD.
   Conclusions Our results show that HOD triggers a cascade effect on plant
   understory and soil microbial communities, as well as a plant succession
   (savannization) process, where understory species colonize the gaps left
   by dead holm oaks, with important implications for ecosystem C and N
   budgets.}},

Abstract = {{This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on pine and oak
   forest dynamics in the mid-montane central Himalayan forest and the
   ecosystem services associated with these vegetation types. Forest
   ecosystems play a crucial role in the livelihood of the central
   Himalayas as well as the adjacent plains, providing a number of tangible
   and intangible ecosystem services, at each stage of succession. The
   successional sequence starts from warm temperate grasslands, followed by
   early successional pine forests, mid-successional pine-oak mixed forests
   and eventually culminating in a late successional oak community. This
   successional sequence is considerably influenced by disturbances like
   fire, grazing, and lopping, which maintain the vegetation types in their
   current form and can act as potential drivers of change. Fire and
   grazing in grasslands and pine forests inhibit the successional process
   by hindering the establishment of pioneer and late successional species,
   respectively. Potential land-cover changes with forest succession can
   lead to changes in ecosystem services supply. We found that the number
   of ecosystem services associated with these vegetation types increase
   from early to late successional community. Current management approaches
   fail to include the dynamic nature of vegetation, which is essential for
   maintenance of ecosystem service supply. In conclusion, the trade-offs
   between ES of global (biodiversity and carbon) and local importance
   (fuel wood and fodder) have to be examined carefully in order to have
   effective conservation and management plans for the region.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years abandonment of traditional management of mountain
   grasslands has been observed throughout Central Europe. However, the
   impact of abandonment on vegetation of mountain grasslands is still
   unclear. In this study it was hypothesized that the cessation of
   traditional management of mesic mountain meadows causes changes in their
   species composition and a decrease in the biodiversity. In total, 260
   plots were established in the Sudetes (SW Poland) on meadows with
   regular annual mowing, meadows with irregular mowing management, and
   abandoned meadows. Releves (5 x 5 m) were performed, and the habitat
   properties were determined using Ellenberg indicator values. The study
   confirmed the hypothesis that the various ways of extensive management
   have an influence on species richness. The lowest species richness was
   observed on the irregularly managed meadows, while higher species
   numbers were found on the abandoned and regular managed meadows. The
   majority of patches on abandoned meadows exhibited degradation through
   the expansion of Solidago gigantea, Solidago canadensis, Lupinus
   polyphyllus, Heracleum sosnovsky, Calamagrostis epigejos, Deschampsia
   flexuosa, Festuca rubra and Hypericum maculatum. Meadows subjected to
   different management practices differed significantly in Ellenberg
   indicator values. The abandoned meadows had the highest values of the
   light index (L) and nitrogen availability (N), whereas the highest
   values of soil moisture (F) were noted on the irregularly managed
   meadows. The degradation of mountain mesic meadows requires regular
   mowing management, which stops ecological succession and preserves their
   high biodiversity. (C) 2017 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by

Abstract = {{Litter quality plays an important role in determining litter
   decomposition and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. We
   investigated the main and interactive effects of nitrogen (N) addition
   and mowing on litter quality (\%N, lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose
   concentrations and lignin:N ratio) of four dominant species in a
   temperate steppe in northern China. In addition to species-specific
   impacts, both N addition and mowing can alter community composition by
   changing relative dominance of individual species, with consequences on
   litter decomposition. Nitrogen addition significantly increased N
   concentration of shoot litters at species- and community-level, while
   mowing did not affect N concentration. Nitrogen addition decreased
   concentrations of lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin:N ratio
   at both species- and community-level. Mowing decreased lignin and
   cellulose concentrations, increased hemicellulose concentrations, and
   did not affect lignin:N ratio at species-level. Mowing decreased
   cellulose concentrations but did not alter lignin and hemicellulose
   concentrations, and lignin:N ratio at the community level. Furthermore,
   mowing did not alter the impacts of N addition on litter quality at both
   organization levels. Our results suggested that both N addition and
   mowing can influence litter quality by affecting individual species
   litter quality and community structure, and thus regulate the processes
   of litter decomposition and nutrient cycling in grassland ecosystems
   through a plant-mediated pathway. Importantly, our results showed that
   the role of annual mowing as a widely-used ecosystem management strategy
   globally appears to be limited in mediating the impacts of N deposition
   on plant-mediated nutrient cycling. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Possible mechanisms underlying abundance and diversity responses of
   nematode communities to plant diversity}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Plant diversity is known to influence the abundance and diversity of
   belowground biota; however, patterns are not well predictable and there
   is still much unknown about the driving mechanisms. We analyzed changes
   in soil nematode community composition as affected by long-term
   manipulations of plant species and functional group diversity in a field
   experiment with plant species diversity controlled by sowing a range of
   1-60 species mixtures and controlling non-sown species by hand weeding.
   Nematode communities contain a variety of species feeding on bacteria,
   fungi, plants, invertebrates, while some are omnivorous. We analyzed
   responses of nematode abundance and diversity to plant species and
   functional diversity, and used structural equation modeling (SEM) to
   explore the possible mechanisms underlying the observed patterns. The
   abundance of individuals of all nematode feeding types, except for
   predatory nematodes, increased with both plant species and plant
   functional group diversity. The abundance of microbial-feeding nematodes
   was related positively to aboveground plant community biomass, whereas
   abundance of plant-feeding nematodes was related positively to shoot C:N
   ratio. The abundance of predatory nematodes, in turn, was positively
   related to numbers of plant-feeding nematodes, but not to the abundance
   of microbial feeders. Interestingly, the numbers of plant-feeding
   nematodes per unit root mass were lowest in the high-diversity plant
   communities, pointing at reduced exposure to belowground herbivores when
   plants grow in species-diverse communities. Taxon richness of
   plant-feeding and microbial-feeding nematodes increased with plant
   species and plant functional group diversity. Increasing plant
   functional group diversity also enhanced taxon richness of predatory
   nematodes. The SEM suggests that bottom-up control effects of plant
   species and plant functional group diversity on abundance of nematodes
   in the various feeding types predominantly involve mechanistic linkages
   related to plant quality instead of plant quantity; especially, C:N
   ratios of the shoot tissues, and/or effects of plants on the soil
   habitat, rather than shoot quantity explained nematode abundance.
   Although aboveground plant properties may only partly serve as a proxy
   for belowground resource quality and quantity, our results encourage
   further studies on nematode responses to variations in plant species and
   plant functional diversity in relation to both quantity and quality of
   the belowground resources.}},

Title = {{Compounded perturbations in coastal areas: contrasting responses to
   nutrient enrichment and the regime of storm-related disturbance depend
   on life-history traits}},

Abstract = {{1. Natural systems are exposed to compounded perturbations, whose
   changes in temporal variance can be as important as those in mean
   intensity for shaping the structure of assemblages. Specifically,
   climate-related physical disturbances and nutrient inputs due to natural
   and/or anthropogenic activities occur concomitantly, but experimental
   tests of the simultaneous effects of changes in the regime of more than
   one perturbation are generally lacking. Filling this gap is the key to
   understand ecological responses of natural assemblages to
   climate-related change in the intensity and temporal patterning of
   physical disturbance combined with other global stressors.
   2. Responses to factorial manipulations of nutrient enrichment, mean
   intensity and temporal variability in storm-like mechanical disturbance
   were examined, using benthic assemblages of tide-pools as model system.
   3. Response variables were mean abundance values and temporal variances
   of taxa with different life-traits. Consistent negative effects of
   disturbance intensity were observed for the mean cover of long-living
   taxa (algal canopies and the polychaete Sabellaria alveolata), whose
   temporal fluctuations were also reduced by more severe mechanical
   stress. More resilient taxa (ephemeral algae, mostly green of the genus
   Ulva) increased under enriched conditions, particularly when
   low-intensity events were irregularly applied over time. Opposite
   effects of disturbance intensity depending on nutrient availability
   occurred on filamentous algae (e.g. red of the genus Ceramium). This was
   probably due to the fact that, although nutrient enrichment stimulated
   the abundance of both algal groups, when this condition was combined
   with relatively mild physical disturbance the competitively superior
   ephemeral green algae tended to become dominant over filamentous red
   algae. The same did not occur under high intensity of disturbance since
   it likely damaged large, foliose fronds of Ulva-like forms more than
   small, filamentous fronds of Ceramium-like forms. Grazers were
   positively affected by nutrients, likely responding indirectly to more
   food available.
   4. A direct relationship between the mean abundance of most organisms
   and their temporal fluctuations was documented. However, all organisms
   persisted throughout the study, even under experimental conditions
   associated to the largest temporal variation in their abundance, likely
   due to their ability to resist to/quickly recover from, the applied
   perturbations. Therefore, in systems with great recovery abilities of
   dominant organisms (e.g. rocky intertidal, grasslands), effects of
   traits of the regime of disturbance and nutrient enrichment may modulate
   the fluctuations of populations not through the elimination and
   substitution of species, but through changes in relative abundances of
   the same species. This contrasts with the theory that temporal variation
   in abundance would be directly related to the risk of local extinction.
   Present findings enable more accurate predictions of the consequences of
   climatic and non-climatic scenarios on the biodiversity of marine and
   terrestrial systems sharing analogous functional traits of organisms.
   Future more intense physical disturbances are expected to exert negative
   effects on slow-growing/recovering species (e.g. habitat-formers)
   irrespectively of the temporal patterning of the same disturbances and
   nutrient inputs. On the contrary, more resistant species (e.g.
   encrusting algae on rocky shores or below-ground vegetation in
   grasslands) are expected to benefit from intense physical disturbance.
   Species whose abundance is more directly related to the availability of
   nutrients (e.g. filamentous and ephemeral algae or herbs) are expected
   to generally increase under enriched conditions, but their ability to
   eventually become dominant would depend on their ability to grow fast
   and attain cover large enough to overwhelm any possible control of
   concomitant disturbance intensity on their abundance. If, such as in the
   present examined system, virtually all organisms can persist, over the
   temporal scale of the experiment, under any combination of physical
   disturbance and nutrient availability, the resulting overall diversity
   is not predicted to change drastically. Nevertheless, low-intensity
   events evenly distributed and high-intensity events irregularly
   distributed appear as the conditions supporting the highest richness of
   taxa, independently of the availability of nutrients.}},

Title = {{Herbivore size matters for productivity-richness relationships in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{674-686}},

Abstract = {{1. Productivity and herbivory often interact to shape plant community
   composition and species richness with levels of production mediating the
   impact of herbivory. However, differences in herbivore traits such as
   size, feeding guild and dietary requirements may result in different
   impacts of diverse herbivore guilds across productivity gradients.
   2. We used size-selective herbivore exclosures to separate the effects
   of herbivory by larger herbivores, such as elephant, Burchell's zebra
   and blue wildebeest from those of medium/smaller herbivores, such as
   impala and warthog, on herbaceous plant communities. These exclosures
   were established along a 10-fold productivity gradient, ranging from 90
   to 950 g m(-2) of standing plant biomass in the Kruger National Park,
   South Africa.
   3. Exclusion of all herbivores generally increased plant species
   richness at low productivity, but decreased richness at high
   productivity. Exclusion of medium/smaller herbivores (e.g. impala,
   warthog) showed stronger effects on plant richness, particularly loss of
   forbs, at higher productivity rather than at lower productivity. In
   contrast, exclusion of larger herbivores had stronger effects on plant
   richness, typically with increasing forb richness, at low rather than
   high productivity.
   4. The change in species richness appeared linked to changes in light
   availability following herbivore exclusion. Strong increases in shading
   led to declines in species richness while more moderate increases in
   shading led to increases in species richness, possibly due to
   amelioration of heat and water stress by modest increases in shading.
   5. Increasing plant dominance, which likely alters multiple mechanisms
   of plant interactions, was correlated with declines in plant richness
   following herbivore exclusion. The impact of increasing dominance on
   plant richness operated independent of productivity, with the exclusion
   of impala appearing particularly important in driving this relationship.
   6. Synthesis. We show that the impact of herbivore losses on plant
   diversity will be strongly situation dependent and will vary with the
   herbivores lost (e.g. larger vs. smaller, grazers vs. browsers), plant

Abstract = {{Question Community invasion and dominance by exotic species can be
   abetted by disturbance and elevated nutrient levels. However, impacts of
   exotics on native species are often manifest through competition,
   suggesting disturbance or nutrient management could benefit native
   species. I therefore asked: does nutrient reduction through carbon
   addition, or disturbance to reduce biomass, contribute to restoration by
   increasing occurrence and richness of native plant species?
   Location SE Australia.
   Methods Using a field experiment spanning 4yrs, this study assessed the
   potential for carbon addition, three types of disturbance (burn, crop,
   slash) and their interaction with native herbivore grazing to reduce
   exotic, and increase native, plant species in a critically endangered
   grassy woodland in SE Australia.
   Results Adding carbon reduced occurrence of one native and three exotic
   species, while increasing one exotic and one native species. The value
   of adding carbon for restoration was therefore ambiguous. Fencing to
   exclude the high-density kangaroo population had temporary beneficial
   effects, suggesting that grazing reduced the number of native and exotic
   plant species by up to 56\% and 21\%, respectively. Species richness
   declined by year 3 in fenced areas, likely through competitive
   exclusion. Burn, slash and crop treatments also provided disturbance
   that maintained species richness and occurrence of many species, both
   native and exotic. Most grazing interactions reflected the benefit of
   alternative disturbance in the absence of grazing. However, there was
   also evidence that two species declined when crop and grazing acted in
   combination.
   Conclusions Very high grazing by native herbivores reduced plant species
   richness in this study. However, grazing or other forms of disturbance
   appeared critical for preventing a small number of exotic species from
   driving down occurrence and richness of many other native and exotic
   plant species. Although increased exotic species richness is
   undesirable, disturbance led to a better outcome for conservation than
   the low-disturbance alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal grazing is one way of the moderate grazing regimes, but little
   information is available on compared study of seasonal grazing in alpine
   meadow. We studied the aboveground and belowground properties among
   warm-seasonal grazing meadows and cold-seasonal grazing meadows on the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Results showed that the warm-seasonal grazing
   increased forb functional group proportion, plant density and evenness
   index but decreased root biomass, plant height and graminoid functional
   group proportions. Grazing seasons affected variation in soil bulk
   density, soil water content, pH and soil nutrient content, and the
   variations caused the various of soil carbon and nitrogen density. The
   highest values of soil carbon and nitrogen contents and densities in the
   warm-season grazing meadow occurred at the top 10-cm soil, while the
   highest values in the cold-season grazing meadow occurred at the depth
   of 30- to 50-cm soil. Our results indicated that the warm-season grazing
   is suitable for the species diversity conservation and the nutrient
   sequestration at the topsoil. However, the cold-season grazing is
   suitable for the nutrient sequestration at the deep soil. This study
   implied that the warm-season and cold-season grazing might be exchanged
   regularly to practice continuous carbon and nitrogen sequestration.
   Periodic cold-season and warm-season grazing would be the suitable
   grazing regime to keep alpine meadow sustainability. Copyright (c) 2016

Abstract = {{Wetland degradation is a source of anxiety and is more severe in cold
   regions than other areas. The soil seed bank acts as a propagule source
   for revegetation to affiliate the restoration of degraded wetlands.
   However, the effects of this approach are controversial and depend on
   the traits of the seed bank and its interactions with the environment.
   The seed bank in an alpine fen meadow was studied to determine its exact
   role in revegetation. The surveyed shore of a Tibetan lake, Gahai Lake,
   was divided into three sites under different levels of grazing pressure.
   Each site was separated into six transects along a water-depth gradient
   to collect soil cores to determine the pattern of biodiversity through a
   germination experiment in a greenhouse. After an analysis of
   heterogeneity-related diversity, partitioning of 58 discovered species
   indicated that 39.5 could be contributed to beta-diversity, which was
   mainly contributed to water depth. Overgrazing (0.607 sheep unit/acre,
   NovemberMarch) decreased seed bank diversity in many respects,
   especially through decreasing spatial heterogeneity and homogenizing
   biota. A lightly grazed, well-protected site had not only the highest
   beta-diversity and species abundance but also the highest inter-site
   species turnover rate compared with other sites under moderate grazing
   intensity. Despite the lack of target species, the seed bank serves as
   (i) a species-rich pool; (ii) an extant legacy seed source for
   sustaining heterogeneity and floristic diversity; and (iii) an
   ecological indicator, and its effect can be reinforced by appropriate
   grazing practices (multiple intensity) and hydrological modifications.

Abstract = {{Orchid mycorrhizal (OrM) fungi play a crucial role in the ontogeny of
   orchids, yet little is known about how the structure of OrM fungal
   communities varies with space and environmental factors. Previous
   studies suggest that within orchid patches, the distance to adult
   orchids may affect the abundance of OrM fungi. Many orchid species grow
   in species-rich temperate semi-natural grasslands, the persistence of
   which depends on moderate physical disturbances, such as grazing and
   mowing. The aim of this study was to test whether the diversity,
   structure and composition of OrM fungal community are influenced by the
   orchid patches and management intensity in semi-natural grasslands. We
   detected putative OrM fungi from 0 to 32 m away from the patches of host
   orchid species (Orchis militaris and Platanthera chlorantha) in 21
   semi-natural calcareous grasslands using pyrosequencing. In addition, we
   assessed different ecological conditions in semi-natural grasslands but
   primarily focused on the effect of grazing intensity on OrM fungal
   communities in soil. We found that investigated orchid species were
   mostly associated with Ceratobasidiaceae and Tulasnellaceae and, to a
   lesser extent, with Sebacinales. Of all the examined factors, the
   intensity of grazing explained the largest proportion of variation in
   OrM fungal as well as total fungal community composition in soil.
   Spatial analyses showed limited evidence for spatial clustering of OrM
   fungi and their dependence on host orchids. Our results indicate that
   habitat management can shape OrM fungal communities, and the spatial
   distribution of these fungi appears to be weakly structured outside the
   orchid patches.}},

Abstract = {{Earth's biodiversity and carbon uptake by plants, or primary
   productivity, are intricately interlinked, underlie many essential
   ecosystem processes, and depend on the interplay among environmental
   factors, many of which are being changed by human activities. While
   ecological theory generalizes across taxa and environments, most
   empirical tests of factors controlling diversity and productivity have
   been observational, single-site experiments, or meta-analyses, limiting
   our understanding of variation among site-level responses and tests of
   general mechanisms. A synthesis of results from ten years of a globally
   distributed, coordinated experiment, the Nutrient Network (NutNet),
   demonstrates that species diversity promotes ecosystem productivity and
   stability, and that nutrient supply and herbivory control diversity via
   changes in composition, including invasions of non-native species and
   extinction of native species. Distributed experimental networks are a
   powerful tool for tests and integration of multiple theories and for
   generating multivariate predictions about the effects of global changes
   on future ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Using Cattle Grazing to Restore a Rough Fescue Prairie Invaded by

Abstract = {{Rough fescue prairies were once common across the northern prairies but
   have now been almost entirely lost to a combination of agricultural
   expansion, energy development, fire suppression, and invasion by exotic
   species. Despite these pressures, remnant grasslands remain important in
   conserving biodiversity and as habitats for threatened species. In this
   project, we test the hypothesis that the density of Kentucky bluegrass
   (Poa pratensis), an invasive, exotic species, introduced across the
   Great Plains, is inversely related with the density of plains rough
   fescue (Festuca hallii), the dominant native grass of northern fescue
   communities, and examine whether cattle grazing could help restore
   invaded prairies. We tested the relationship between the two species
   using 33 transects (0-44 m), located within patches of rough fescue
   prairie at the Batoche National Historic Site of Canada in Saskatchewan.
   Along each transect, we recorded the density of Kentucky bluegrass and
   plains rough fescue and used cattle exclosures to test the hypothesis
   that grazing reduces the abundance of the invader and increases the
   abundance of plains rough fescue. Although higher densities of Kentucky
   bluegrass were negatively correlated with the density of plains rough
   fescue, grazing by cattle did not significantly reduce the density of
   Kentucky bluegrass, 6 yr after the initiation of grazing. However,
   cattle grazing also did not reduce the density of plains rough fescue,
   suggesting that it may provide a valuable tool to actively manage and
   restore invaded prairies. Our results also suggest that long-term
   monitoring and additional measurements of community diversity and
   productivity may be necessary to demonstrate the success of this
   restoration method. (C) 2017 The Society for Range Management. Published

Title = {{Camel forage variety in the Karamoja sub-region, Uganda}},
Journal = {{PASTORALISM-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{Camels have the potential to increase the resilience of pastoral
   communities to the impacts of climate variability and change. Despite
   this potential, there is limited documentation of the camel forage
   species, their availability and distribution. The study was conducted in
   Karamoja sub-region in Uganda and involved assessment of vegetation with
   intent to characterize the range of forage species available for camels
   in the region. The camel grazing area was stratified based on land cover
   types, namely woodland, bushland, grassland and farmland using the
   Amudat and Moroto district vegetation maps. Vegetation plots measuring
   20 m x 20 m were mapped out among the land cover types where species
   identification was undertaken. In addition, a cross-sectional survey
   involving 52 camel herders was used to document the camel forage species
   preferences. Shannon and Simpson diversity indices as well as the
   Jaccard coefficient were used to measure the species richness, relative
   abundance, diversity and plant community similarities among the land
   cover types. Results showed high species richness and diversities in the
   bushland and woodland land cover types. Plant communities in the
   woodland and bushlands were found to be more similar. A wide range of
   plant species were reported to be preferred by camels in the study area,
   that is 63 in Amudat and 50 in Moroto districts. respectively, with
   Balanites, Euphorbia and several Acacia species taking precedence.
   Therefore, given the diversity of camel forage species, this study
   recommends increased adoption of camel rearing in Karamoja sub-region.
   Further, the camel owners are encouraged to undertake conservation
   management and deliberate production of preferred forage species such as
   Euphorbia tirucalli that also exhibit ease of propagation and
   adaptability to the sub-region. This browse could support the milking
   herd and the camel calves that remain at the homesteads. A toxicological
   analysis of E. tirucalli is however recommended, given irritant latex
   discharge, prior to taking this recommendation to scale.}},

   trophic structure of soil nematodes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 12}},
Abstract = {{Alpine wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau are undergoing
   degradation. However, little is known regarding the response of soil
   nematodes to this degradation. We conducted investigations in a wet
   meadow (WM), a grassland meadow (GM), a moderately degraded meadow (MDM)
   and a severely degraded meadow (SDM) from April to October 2011. The
   nematode community taxonomic composition was similar in the WM, GM and
   MDM and differed from that in the SDM. The abundance declined
   significantly from the WM to the SDM. The taxonomic richness and Shannon
   index were comparable between the WM and MDM but were significantly
   lower in the SDM, and the Pielou evenness showed the opposite pattern.
   The composition, abundance and diversity in the WM and SDM were
   relatively stable over time compared with other habitats. The abundances
   of all trophic groups, aside from predators, decreased with degradation.
   The relative abundances of herbivores, bacterivores, predators and
   fungivores were stable, while those of omnivores and algivores responded
   negatively to degradation. Changes in the nematode community were mainly
   driven by plant species richness and soil available N. Our results
   demonstrate that alpine wetland degradation significantly affects the
   soil nematode communities, suppressing but not shifting the main energy
   pathways through the soil nematode communities.}},

Abstract = {{In managed forests, biodiversity conservation is crucial for the
   sustainable use of ecosystem resources. In the Patagonian-Andes forests
   of Argentina, lenga (Nothofagus pumilio) is the most important native
   tree because of its ecological functions and economic importance as a
   timber provider. In this study, we determined how the shelterwood-cut
   system impacts understory vegetation attributes in three sites
   representing typical lenga forests of central Andean-Patagonia. In each
   site, two 250-m(2) treatment plots (managed and unmanaged) were
   established, and canopy cover, soil temperature, and moisture were
   determined. Within plots in 10 randomly placed 0.25-m(2) microplots, we
   determined plant cover, from which we calculated diversity attributes.
   Canopy cover and soil moisture were higher in unmanaged treatments,
   whereas the reverse was true for soil temperature. The Shannon-Wiener
   index showed similar values (similar to 1), whereas species richness was
   slightly higher in unmanaged (4.8 +/- 0.5) than in managed treatments
   (3.8 +/- 0.3). Generally, native plants dominated the understory
   (similar to 40\%), whereas exotic species were rare (similar to 1\%).
   Shrub cover was higher in managed (24.1 +/- 4.2) than in unmanaged (9.5
   +/- 1.7) treatments, whereas herbaceous species dominated unmanaged
   forests. These results confirm that the shelterwood-cut system may be
   used for diversity conservation in Patagonian lenga forests.}},

Title = {{Biodiversity, land use and ecosystem services-An organismic and
   comparative approach to different geographical regions}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Pages = {{114-125}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Here, we introduce a concept that addresses the complex interrelations
   between land use and biodiversity by applying an organismic and
   comparative approach towards grassland ecosystems in southern Africa and
   temperate Europe. While the natural savannas of southern Africa evolved
   millions of years ago, cultural grasslands in Europe emerged as a result
   of intensifying agriculture only a few hundred years ago. A unique
   feature of recent African ecosystems is the high original megafaunal
   species diversity (taxa existing prior to Pleistocene extinctions).
   European ecosystems have been shaped by humans and the original
   megafaunal species diversity is clearly reduced.
   Similar to the situation in southern Africa today, large herbivores also
   created a cyclic habitat mosaic in Europe during the last interglacial.
   The depleted herbivore community in Europe during the early Holocene was
   no longer able to maintain this cyclic succession. This resulted in a
   more uniform and dense vegetation type - a process that can be currently
   witnessed in Africa in bush encroachment. The comparative approach
   considers further strong natural and cultural linkages between Europe
   and Africa, such as biogeographical relations between continents,
   faunistic similarities during the late Pleistocene, the Afro-Palearctic
   bird migration system or the domestication history of European and
   African cattle.
   Our approach is based on the assumption that comparative investigations
   of response patterns under different ecological conditions lead to a
   better understanding of the common interrelations between land use and
   biodiversity. It deals with the central question, whether ecosystems
   respond in a similar way to disturbances. Biodiversity response patterns
   in relatively undisturbed savanna ecosystems might be a valuable
   reference for Europe, e.g. in terms of increasing aridity in Europe in
   the future. The comparative approach requires a careful selection of
   primary taxa. Special focus is on the use of terrestrial small mammals
   as ecological indicators.
   The approach further focuses on human-wildlife interactions. The
   emergence of top predators in Europe reveals the value of the experience
   from Africa, where pastoralists manage to coexist with large predators
   since millennia. The investigation of African grasslands enables a
   critical reflection and a thorough understanding of processes, which
   have occurred a long time ago in Europe. Our approach leads to a
   revaluation of the significance of Africa in terms of a conservative,
   relict case scenario that can provide essential insights into the
   original situation of ecosystems, especially in view of ``rewilding''
   approaches in Europe. Thereby, the approach leads to a careful
   consideration of the term ``wilderness''. (C) 2017 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Habitat loss is one of the primary environmental causes of biodiversity
   decline across scales; locally to globally. Ecological restoration is
   acknowledged as an important tool to counteract this negative trend. The
   semi-natural calcareous sand dune meadows in south-western Norway are
   known for their high species diversity, much like similar habitats of
   high conservation value across Europe today. The recent cessation of
   grazing has caused a decline in several endangered species associated
   with these habitats due to the advancement of secondary succession. We
   conducted a long-term restoration experiment in semi-natural dune
   meadows over 16 years to examine if current trends in biodiversity loss
   could be reversed and at what time-scale restoration measures take
   effect. Three treatments were applied; mowing annually, mowing
   bi-annually, and a control (no mowing). In fields mown annually species
   richness increased significantly over time. However, the response was
   slow and significant effects were first seen after year 10. Fields mown
   bi-annually also showed a similar trend but the response was more
   variable. Several characteristic meadow species were favoured by annual
   mowing while they declined in the control fields. Principal component
   analysis (PCA) revealed a compositional shift, indicating the
   re-arrangement/-establishment of typical meadow vegetation in the mown
   sites, contrasting the further successional development in the control.
   Our results demonstrate the importance of long-term data in supporting
   good evidence-based management. Annual mowing is effectively restoring
   this unique habitat, but restoration efforts need to be sustained over
   many years to show positive effects.}},

Abstract = {{Current intensified livestock production threatens global biodiversity
   and food security. Increasing the use of semi-natural, species-rich
   grasslands for grazing and hay-making could serve as a way to bridge
   biodiversity conservation and livestock production but we know little
   about the nutritional composition of native grasslands. To determine the
   effect of grassland biodiversity on forage quality and the potential
   benefits and limitations of using conservation grasslands for
   agriculture, I conducted ecological and ethnobotanical research at 30
   grassland sites in Oxfordshire, England. Species-richness and
   composition increased forage dry matter, sugar, and Phosphorus (P)
   content. Forage from species-rich grasslands contained up to 27\% more
   protein, 56\% more Phosphorus (P), 106\% more Potassium (K), and 183\%
   more Calcium (Ca) than cereals and conventional hay and met the
   nutritional requirements of beef cattle, sheep, and horses. Farmers and
   graziers valued species-rich grasslands were (1) the medicinal effect of
   specific grassland plants on livestock, (2) affordability, (3) the
   resilience of species-rich grasslands to drought and flooding, (4)
   conservation, and (5) marketability of pastoral products. The main
   factors inhibiting the (continued or increased) agricultural use of
   species-rich grasslands were restrictions on time of grazing,
   restrictions on time of hay-cut, and reduced grassland yield and forage
   quality due to recent increases in invasive plants. More flexible
   agro-environmental guidelines around species-rich grassland use are
   necessary to balance the agricultural as well as ecological value of
   these landscapes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hedgerows are key features in agricultural landscapes performing diverse
   functions that are both economically and ecologically significant. Here,
   we quantify how the characteristics of a relict hedgerow network of a
   Spanish cultural landscape (Guadarrama mountains in the north of Madrid
   region) have changed over a single decade both inside and outside the
   boundaries of a Protected Area, the aim of which is to conserve cultural
   uses and biodiversity. A gradient of abandonment of pasture systems was
   detected, including a decline and loss of woody species from hedgerows
   associated with grazed areas towards shrub encroachment zones. These
   tendencies were similar inside and outside the boundaries of the
   Protected Area. The results highlight the management weaknesses of the
   Protected Area in order to achieve its objectives. Based on the results,
   we propose to include a specific conservation status for hedgerow
   landscapes in the regulatory framework of Spanish protected areas.

Title = {{Is livestock grazing compatible with biodiversity conservation? Impacts

Volume = {{26}},

Pages = {{883-897}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by domestic livestock is one of the most widespread forms of
   anthropogenic disturbance globally, and can have a major impact on
   biodiversity and therefore conservation values. Here we use ants to
   assess the extent to which livestock grazing is compatible with
   biodiversity conservation in a tropical savanna of northern Australia,
   where there is growing pressure to intensify pastoral production. We
   focus on the extent to which ant responses conform with four general
   patterns identified in a recent global review: (1) soil and vegetation
   type have a far bigger impact on ant community composition than does
   grazing; (2) grazing modifies ant species composition but often not
   species richness or total abundance; (3) a species' response often
   varies among habitats; and (4) between 25-50\% of the species that can
   be statistically analysed are responsive to grazing. We sampled ants
   using pitfall traps at 38 sites in two land systems, based on
   cross-fence comparisons of areas of different grazing intensities. A
   total of 130 ant species from 24 genera were recorded, with the fauna
   dominated by species of Iridomyrmex and Monomorium. Land system was the
   primary driver of variation in ant species richness and composition, and
   grazing intensity was related to neither species richness nor total
   abundance. Only 10\% of common species appeared to be impacted by
   grazing. Overall, ant responses to grazing in our study region were
   generally consistent with the four global patterns, except that the
   local fauna seems to be particularly resilient. Such resilience
   indicates that current grazing management practices are compatible with
   the conservation of ant biodiversity.}},

Pages = {{961-970}},

Abstract = {{Both bottom-up (e.g., nutrients) and top-down (e.g., herbivory) forces
   structure plant communities, but it remains unclear how they affect the
   relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes in plant
   community assembly. Moreover, different-sized herbivores have been shown
   to have contrasting effects on community structure and function, but
   their effects on the processes governing community assembly (i.e., how
   they generate the impacts on structure) remain largely unknown. We
   evaluated the influence of bottom-up and top-down forces on the relative
   importance of deterministic and stochastic processes during plant
   community assembly. We used the data of a 7-yr factorial experiment
   manipulating-nutrient availability (ambient and increased) and the
   presence of vertebrate herbivores (> 1 kg) of different body size in a
   floodplain grassland in The Netherlands. We used a null model that
   describes a community composition expected by chance (i. e., stochastic
   assembly) and compared the plant community composition in the different
   treatments with this null model (the larger the difference, the more
   deterministically assembled). Our results showed that herbivore
   exclusion promoted a more stochastic plant community assembly, whereas
   increased nutrients played a relatively minor role in determining the
   relative importance of stochasticity in community assembly. Large
   herbivores facilitated intermediate-sized mammal herbivores, resulting
   in synergistic effects of enhanced grazing pressure and a more
   deterministic and convergent plant community assembly. We conclude that
   herbivores can act as strong deterministic forces during community
   assembly in natural systems. Our results also reveal that although
   large-and intermediate-sized mammal herbivores often have contrasting
   effects on many community and ecosystem properties, they can also
   synergistically homogenize plant communities.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{416-426}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The impacts of land-use change on biodiversity in the Himalayas are
   poorly known, notwithstanding widespread deforestation and agricultural
   intensification in this highly biodiverse region. Although intact
   primary forests harbor many Himalayan birds during breeding, a large
   number of bird species use agricultural lands during winter. We assessed
   how Himalayan bird species richness, abundance, and composition during
   winter are affected by forest loss stemming from agriculture and
   grazing. Bird surveys along 12 elevational transects within primary
   forest, low-intensity agriculture, mixed subsistence agriculture, and
   intensively grazed pastures in winter revealed that bird species
   richness and abundance were greatest in low-intensity and mixed
   agriculture, intermediate in grazed pastures, and lowest in primary
   forest at both local and landscape scales; over twice as many species
   and individuals were recorded in low-intensity agriculture than in
   primary forest. Bird communities in primary forests were distinct from
   those in all other land-use classes, but only 4 species were unique to
   primary forests. Low-, medium-, and high-intensity agriculture harbored
   32 unique species. Of the species observed in primary forest, 80\% had
   equal or greater abundance in low-intensity agricultural lands,
   underscoring the value of these lands in retaining diverse community
   assemblages at high densities in winter. Among disturbed landscapes,
   bird species richness and abundance declined as land-use intensity
   increased, especially in high-intensity pastures. Our results suggest
   that agricultural landscapes are important for most Himalayan bird
   species in winter. But agricultural intensificationespecially increased
   grazingwill likely result in biodiversity losses. Given that forest
   reserves alone may inadequately conserve Himalayan birds in winter,
   comprehensive conservation strategies in the region must go beyond
   protecting intact primary forests and ensure that low-intensity
   agricultural lands are not extensively converted to high-intensity
   pastures.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing management is an important tool to preserve insect biodiversity.
   Although literature has discussed the importance of grazing pressure
   adjustment to support grassland insect communities for the ecosystem
   services they provide, little has been published on the economic
   sustainability of such management adjustments to date. This study
   compared continuous grazing (CG) to an innovative rotational grazing
   system (the biodiversity-friendly rotation BR), where a subplot was
   excluded from grazing for two months during the main flowering period.
   The effects of grazing two different species (cattle and sheep) within
   both systems were also evaluated. The aims were to assess the effects on
   butterfly, bumblebee, and ground beetle assemblages, along with the
   impact on herbage mass and animal performance. The BR enhanced both the
   abundance and species richness of flower-visiting insect assemblages and
   it was observed that cattle provided better results than sheep grazing.
   A multivariate redundancy analysis highlighted that most of the
   flower-visiting species (including almost all the endangered and locally
   rare species) were favoured by BR-cattle treatment, mainly due to the
   high percentage of flower cover and sward heterogeneity involved in this
   treatment. However, grazing system and grazer species did not affect
   ground beetle species richness or abundance. Moreover, herbage mass and
   animal performance (live weight and body condition score) were
   comparable between CG and BR throughout the grazing season. The BR could
   be a useful management system to enhance grassland flower-visiting
   insect assemblages whilst meeting farm production objectives, especially
   in protected environments where insect conservation is a major target.

Abstract = {{An emerging planning framework for climate adaptation focuses on
   interactions among societal values, institutional rules and scientific
   and experiential knowledge about biophysical impacts of climate change
   and adaptation options. These interactions shape the decision context
   that can enable or constrain effective adaptation. To illustrate the
   operationalisation of this `values-rules-knowledge' (VRK) framework we
   developed biophysical adaptation pathways for agricultural landscapes of
   south-eastern Australia, which are expected to become warmer and drier
   under climate change. We used the VRK framework to identify potential
   constraints to implementing the pathways. Drawing on expert knowledge,
   published literature, biodiversity modelling and stakeholder workshops
   we identified potential adaptation pathways for (1) the production
   matrix, (2) high conservation value remnant eucalypt woodlands, and (3)
   woodland trees. Adaptation options included shifts from mixed cropping
   grazing to rangeland grazing or biomass enterprises; promoting
   re-assembly of native ecological communities; and maintaining ecosystem
   services and habitat that trees provide. Across all pathways, applying
   the VRK framework elucidated fifteen key implementation constraints,
   including limits to farm viability, decreasing effectiveness of
   environmental legislation and conflicting values about exotic plants.
   Most of the constraints involved interactions among VRK; 13 involved
   rules, eight involved values, and seven involved knowledge. Value
   constraints appeared most difficult to address, whereas those based on
   rules or knowledge were more tangible. The lower number of knowledge
   constraints may reflect the scale of our analysis (which focused on
   decision points in pre-defined pathways); new knowledge and
   participatory approaches would likely yield a richer set of scenarios.
   We conclude that the VRK framework helps connect the biophysical
   knowledge-based view of adaptation with a perspective on the need for
   changes in social systems, enabling targeting of constraints to
   adaptation. Our focus on pathways and decision points in different
   sectors of the multi-use landscape highlighted the importance of group
   and higher level planning and policy for balancing the collective
   outcomes of multiple decisions by many land managers. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Title = {{Taxonomic and functional vegetation changes after shifting management
   from traditional herding to fenced grazing in temperate grassland
   communities}},
Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{259-270}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Question: How does a management change from sheep grazing by traditional
   pastoral herding plus occasional mowing to free-ranging grazing in
   temporarily fenced areas affect vegetation in dry and wet semi-natural
   grassland communities?
   Location: Kosterbeck Nature Reserve, NE Germany.
   Methods: We analysed the change in floristic and functional diversity
   and composition based on a resurvey of a 23-yr-old phytosociological
   data set. At 10 yrs after the original survey, the grazing regime had
   changed as described above. Since the exact locations of plots of the
   original survey could not be reconstructed, we placed the resurvey plots
   stratified randomly within the respective community types. Functional
   composition in relation to the environment was analysed with the RLQ
   approach using community means of Ellenberg species indicator values as
   proxies for environmental conditions.
   Results: Although the grazing regime changed in the same direction in
   the whole area, the wet and dry grasslands responded differently: when
   the changes are analysed for the whole data set, they are hidden behind
   the differences between vegetation types, and neither plant species
   alpha-and gamma-diversity, nor species composition changes are apparent.
   However, when analysed separately, diversity changes were negligible for
   the wet meadow communities, whereas both alpha-and gamma-diversity
   increased in the drier sites, leaving beta-diversity unchanged. Despite
   the minor changes in species diversity in the wet grassland, functional
   composition changed considerably towards graminoid species. In the dry
   communities, an increase in species richness was accompanied by an
   increase in functional richness, and a trend towards competitive
   strategist species.
   Conclusion: Even minor changes in grazing regime can significantly
   affect grassland communities, while the effects may vary strongly
   between vegetation types and incoherently across different measures of
   change. This suggests that thorough analysis of vegetation developments
   after management changes should be carried out on different levels of
   data set integration and should include severalmeasures of change.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: How do vegetation changes in a limestone beech forest
   community on dry and nutrient-poor slopes differ from changes in a
   community on moist and nutrient-rich soils over the past 50 yr? Have
   temporal changes led to a further differentiation between communities?
   Location: Ancient, beech-dominated forest region on limestone in central
   Germany.
   Methods: We compared vegetation releves sampled between 1955 and 1960
   and resurveyed between 2009 and 2012 on quasi-permanent plots in the
   CariciFagetum primuletosum (n = 26) on dry, nutrient-poor and
   sun-exposed slopes, and in the Hordelymo-Fagetum allietosum ( n = 25) on
   nutrient-rich plateau sites with mesic soils in spring. We concentrated
   on changes in species richness, vegetation structure and vegetation
   composition, identified winner and loser species and calculated
   pair-wise dissimilarity indices within and between communities to test
   for differentiation or homogenization over time.
   Results: Our results show a more pronounced change in community
   composition in the Carici-Fagetum primuletosum within 50 yr compared to
   the Hordelymo-Fagetum allietosum. Despite no significant increase in
   total canopy cover, shade-tolerant, mesophilous, nutrient-demanding
   species expanded, whereas light-demanding, drought-tolerant,
   oligotrophic, often Red List species decreased. Changes in the
   Hordelymo-Fagetum allietosum were more random. Overall, vegetation
   dynamics led to a homogenization between the two contrasting communities
   caused by a loss of specialized species from the CariciFagetum community
   and a gain in generalist species in both communities.
   Conclusion: The drastic changes in the Carici-Fagetum community indicate
   the higher susceptibility of marginal sites - that often have a high
   conservation value - to local environmental changes. In particular, N
   deposition and the abandonment of former ( more traditional)
   forestmanagement, such as coppicewith- standards and wood pasture, are
   responsible for this development. On the other hand, the increasing
   temperatures from climate change are not sufficient to secure the
   survival of the once frequent thermophilous species. Therefore, adequate
   forest management and conservation measures, such as the removal of
   competitive or exotic tree species or the re-establishment of
   coppice-withstandards management, are necessary to counteract the on-
   going biotic homogenization of beech forest communities and should focus
   onmarginal sites.}},

Abstract = {{Plant diversity experiments generally find that increased diversity
   causes increased productivity; however, primary productivity is
   typically measured in the presence of a diverse food web, including
   pathogens, mutualists and herbivores. If food web impacts on
   productivity vary with plant diversity, as predicted by both theoretical
   and empirical studies, estimates of the effect of plant diversity on
   productivity may be biased. We experimentally removed arthropods, foliar
   fungi and soil fungi from the longest-running plant diversity
   experiment. We found that fungi and arthropods removed a constant, large
   proportion of biomass leading to a greater reduction of total biomass in
   high diversity plots. As a result, the effect of diversity on measured
   plant productivity was much higher in the absence of fungi and
   arthropods. Thus, diversity increases productivity more than reported in
   previous studies that did not control for the effects of heterotrophic
   consumption.}},

Journal = {{ECOSYSTEM SERVICES}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Grasslands cover around 25\% of the earth's land surface and provide
   many essential Ecosystem Services (ES) to human well-being. Changes in
   grazing intensity have led to changes in biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning, resulting in loss of some of these ES. This emphasizes the
   need for grassland management schemes that aim to maximize economic
   returns from grasslands while maintaining ecosystem functioning, but
   tools to assess the tradeoffs between economic benefits and Ecosystem
   Services are, for the most part, lacking.
   This study is aimed at economically valuing multiple ecosystem services,
   and the tradeoffs between them and species richness, across different
   management alternatives (control, light, moderate and heavy grazing) in
   the Karei-Deshe experimental farm and Long Term Ecosystem Research
   (LTER) site. Ecological data from previous research in Karei-Deshe was
   valuated using the Replacement Cost Method and a Contingent Valuation
   survey, which valued the farm's landscape.
   Grazing intensity was inversely related to the delivery of ES studied
   and positively related to species richness, except for heavy grazing,
   which resulted in lower species richness. Only heavy grazing was found
   to be an inefficient management alternative. This research demonstrates
   a fairly simple path for providing land managers an
   ecological-data-based tool for comparing management alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Extensively harvested grassland ecosystems contribute substantially to
   European biodiversity, but different kinds of grassland usage may
   selectively foster individual taxa. A combination of management options
   may offer a promising way to maximize biodiversity at the landscape
   scale. Here, we test this hypothesis based on 91 butterfly samples taken
   in the years 2013-2015 in differently managed areas within a large
   conservation area, the National Park Neusiedler See/Seewinkel in
   eastern-most Austria. Altogether, we recorded 4713 butterfly individuals
   of 35 species. Based on these records, we show that the parallelism of
   three management options, i.e. pasturing by mobile cattle herds, annual
   hay cut in early summer, and fallow land mulched in late summer,
   increase species diversity of butterflies and burnet moths in the
   regional meta-community. Even though spatial distances between our
   sample sites were small compared to the activity ranges of adult
   butterflies, we found that species composition of butterfly and burnet
   assemblages significantly differed between the three management options,
   indicating that assemblages were shaped by factors at the site level.
   Differences in species composition were stable across three consecutive
   years, even though there was annual variation in butterfly assemblages.
   Other tested co-variables (soil moisture, soil nitrogen, abundance of
   nectar flowers and local plant species richness) did not additionally
   contribute to explaining species composition of butterfly communities.
   We conclude that maintaining a combination of three complementary
   management options is indeed a relevant strategy for biodiversity
   preservation in this internationally renowned conservation area.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing food production is essential to meet the future food demand
   of a growing world population. In light of pressing sustainability
   challenges such as climate change and the importance of the global
   livestock system for food security as well as GHG emissions, finding
   ways to increasing food production sustainably and without increasing
   competition for food crops is essential. Yet, many unknowns relate to
   livestock grazing, in particular grazing intensity, an essential
   variable to assess the sustainability of livestock systems. Here, we
   explore ecological limits to grazing intensity (GI; i.e. the fraction of
   net primary production consumed by grazing animals) by analysing the
   role of seasonality in natural grasslands. We estimate seasonal
   limitations to GI by combining monthly net primary production data and a
   map of global livestock distribution with assumptions on the length of
   nonfavourable periods that can be bridged by livestock (e.g. by browsing
   dead standing biomass, storage systems or biomass conservation). This
   allows us to derive a seasonality-limited potential GI, which we compare
   with the GI prevailing in 2000. We find that GI in 2000 lies below its
   potential on 39\% of the total global natural grasslands, which has a
   potential for increasing biomass extraction of up to 181 MtC/yr. In
   contrast, on 61\% of the area GI exceeds the potential, made possible by
   management. Mobilizing this potential could increase milk production by
   5\%, meat production by 4\% or contribute to free up to 2.8 Mio km(2) of
   grassland area at the global scale if the numerous socio-ecological
   constraints can be overcome. We discuss socio-ecological trade-offs,
   which may reduce the estimated potential considerably and require the
   establishment of sound monitoring systems and an improved understanding
   of livestock system's role in the Earth system.}},

Title = {{Increased soil nutrition and decreased light intensity drive species
   loss after eight years grassland enclosures}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 27}},
Abstract = {{Enclosures (fenced, grazing or clipping) within a certain period of
   years are the most common tools for restoration of degraded grasslands
   in temperate regions. Short-term enclosures can improve biodiversity and
   productivity by effectively relieving grazing pressure, while long-term
   enclosures can reduce species diversity. We therefore carried out a
   field experiment to investigate the specific causes of the reduced
   species diversity in Hulunbeier grassland of northern China. After eight
   years of enclosure, the significantly increased soil available nitrogen
   (AN) and available phosphorus (AvP) in enclosure community reduced
   nitrogen (N) limitation but most vegetation was still N limited. Many
   environmental factors led to decreased species richness, but increased
   soil AN and decreased light intensity at the community bottom were the
   most significant ones. Community density decreased independently of soil
   nutrition but significantly related to decreased species richness.
   Density of dominant canopy species increased, while dominant understory
   species decreased during assemblage-level thinning; therefore, the
   random-loss hypothesis was not supported. The dominant understory
   species responded to lower light availability by increasing their
   height, leaf area, and chlorophyll content. Moreover, our results were
   expected to provide some specific guidance for the restoration mode
   selection of degraded grasslands in northern China.}},

Volume = {{348}},

Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Natural grassland communities are threatened by a variety of factors,
   such as climate change and increasing land use by mankind. The use of
   plant protection products (synthetic or organic) is mandatory in
   agricultural food production. To avoid adverse effects on natural
   grasslands within agricultural areas, synthetic plant protection
   products are strictly regulated in Europe. However, effects of
   herbicides on non-target terrestrial plants are primarily studied on the
   level of individual plants neglecting interactions between species.
   In our study, we aim to extrapolate individual-level effects to the
   population and community level by adapting an existing spatio-temporal,
   individual-based plant community model (IBC-grass). We analyse the
   effects of herbicide exposure for three different grassland communities:
   1) representative field boundary community, 2) Calthion grassland
   community, and 3) Arrhenatheretalia grassland community. Our simulations
   show that herbicide depositions can have effects on non-target plant
   communities resulting from direct and indirect effects on population
   level. The effect extent depends not only on the distance to the field,
   but also on the specific plant community, its disturbance regime
   (cutting frequency, trampling and grazing intensity) and resource level.
   Mechanistic modelling approaches such as IBC-grass present a promising
   novel approach in transferring and extrapolating standardized pot
   experiments to community level and thereby bridging the gap between
   ecotoxicological testing (e.g. in the greenhouse) and protection goals
   referring to real world conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Plant composition of species-richmountain grasslands can
   affect the sensorial and chemical attributes of dairy and meat products,
   with implications for human health. A multivariate approach was used to
   analyse the complex relationships between vegetation characteristics
   (botanical composition and plant community variables) and chemical
   composition (proximate constituents and fatty acid profile) in
   mesophilic and dry vegetation ecological groups, comprising six
   different semi-natural grassland types in the Western Italian Alps.
   RESULTS: Mesophilic and dry grasslands were comparable in terms of
   phenology, biodiversity indices and proportion of botanical families.
   The contentof total fatty acids and that of the most abundant fatty
   acids (alpha-linolenic, linoleic and palmitic acids) were mainly
   associated to nutrient-rich plant species, belonging to the mesophilic
   grassland ecological group. Mesophilic grasslands showed also higher
   values of crude protein, lower values of fibre content and they were
   related to higher pastoral values of vegetation compared to dry
   grasslands. The proximate composition and fatty acid profile appeared
   mainly single species dependent rather than botanical family dependent.
   CONCLUSION: These findings highlight that forage from mesophilic
   grasslands can provide higher nutritive value for ruminants and may be
   associated to ruminant-derived food products with a healthier fatty acid
   profile. (C) 2016 Society of Chemical Industry}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{388}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Forests of the Apennines are characterised by high canopy cover and high
   tree species diversity (being at the interface between two major
   climatic zones of Europe), and provide important ecosystem functions to
   millions of people. They exemplify cutting-edge themes such as forest
   ecology in warmer climates, consequences of heavy land use, and
   resilience at the trailing edge of the distribution of many European
   forest species (Silver fir, Norway spruce, Beech, Black pine, Birch).
   We introduce the setting under the geological and climatological point
   of view and review the literature on the interactions between these
   long-term drivers and the specific, structural, and genetic diversity of
   these forest communities (e.g., effects of glacial refugia or
   tectonic/volcanic activity), followed by a brief outline of what little
   is known about natural disturbance regimes and their range of
   variability. Anthropogenic disturbances (fire, grazing) and land use
   changes (abandonment of cropland and pasture) have been by far the main
   drivers of forest dynamics at least for the last two millennia,
   determining for examples overageing of coppices, treeline advances,
   forest encroachment on former agricultural land.
   We suggest considerations about the interplay between these land use
   changes and disturbance drivers (e.g. fuel continuity), summarize
   comparisons between managed and unmanaged forests (e.g., increase in
   tree size, deadwood, biodiversity indicators), and elaborate on current
   proposals for climate-adapted management, highlighting specific and
   genetic diversity as an important source of resilience and adaptive
   potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Management factors affecting densities of common grassland birds of high
   elevation grasslands of eastern South Africa: Ingula as a case study}},
Journal = {{AVIAN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: World-wide grassland birds are in decline due to habitat
   loss and degradation resulting from intensive agricultural practices.
   Understanding how key grassland habitat attributes determine grassland
   bird densities is required to make appropriate conservation decisions.
   We examine drivers of bird densities in a South African grassland area
   that has been managed for biodiversity conservation with reduced grazing
   pressure.
   Methods: We estimated the density of the eight most common grassland
   bird species encountered in our area to evaluate the effects of recent
   grassland management changes on the avifauna. We collected data on birds
   and habitat from the austral summers of 2006/2007, 2007/2008 and
   2010/2011. We used hierarchical distance sampling methods to estimate
   density of birds relative to two main habitat variables, i.e., grass
   cover and height. In addition, we used regression splines within these
   distance sampling models as a more flexible description of suitable
   ranges of grass height and cover for each species.
   Results: For most species, density is related to grass height and cover
   as expected. The African Quailfinch (Ortygospiza atricollis) and Common
   Quail (Coturnix coturnix) preferred relatively short and open grass. The
   Yellow-breasted Pipit (Anthus chloris), African Pipit (Anthus
   cinnamomeus) and Red-capped Lark (Calandrella cinerea) preferred short
   and relatively dense grass, while the Wing-snapping Cisticola (Cisticola
   ayresii) preferred grass of intermediate height and cover. The Cape
   Longclaw (Macronyx capensis) and Zitting Cisticola (Cisticola juncidis)
   preferred tall and dense grass. Our results agree with previous studies
   that grass height combined with grass cover are the most important
   habitat features that managers should manipulate in order to increase
   the density of target species. The regression splines show that the
   effect of these two habitat variables on density is well described by
   linear relationships for most species.
   Conclusions: This study supports previous studies suggesting that
   grazing and fire are important tools for management to use in order to
   create a mosaic of grass height and cover that would support high
   densities of desired species. We suggest that conservation managers of
   these grasslands combine fire and grazing as management tools to create
   suitable habitats for grassland birds in general.}},

Title = {{Habitat requirements of endangered species in a former coppice of high

Abstract = {{Transformation of coppices to high forests has caused fundamental
   changes in site conditions and a decline of many species across Central
   Europe. Nevertheless, some formerly coppiced forests still harbour a
   number of the declining species and have become biodiversity hotspots in
   the changing landscape. We focused on the best-preserved remnant of
   formerly grazed and coppiced subcontinental oak forest in the Czech
   Republic - the DAbrava forest near the town of Hodonin. To improve our
   understanding of the ecology of declining species, we studied local
   habitat requirements of vascular plants most endangered at the national
   level. We recorded vegetation composition and sampled important site
   variables in plots with the largest populations of endangered species
   and in additional plots placed randomly across all major forest
   habitats. We demonstrated that sites with endangered species have a
   highly uneven distribution in ecological space and that their species
   composition is often similar to open-canopy oak forests. Within this
   habitat, the endangered species are concentrated in places with a high
   light availability and high soil pH. Light-demanding species
   characteristic of subcontinental oak forests are the best indicators of
   these sites, while broadly distributed shade-tolerant and
   nutrient-demanding species avoid them. These results support the view
   that the occurrence of many endangered species in the DAbrava forest is
   a legacy of the long history of traditional management that kept the
   canopies open. Light-demanding species are now threatened by ongoing
   successional changes. Therefore, active conservation measures are
   recommended, including opening up the canopies, early thinning of young
   stands, control of expansive and invasive species and understorey
   grazing or mowing.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{250-259}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{AimsIn arid grasslands forbs represent a large component of species
   diversity and provide a key resource for pollinators and consumers.
   However, low abundances and high temporal variability make it
   challenging to successfully predict forb presence and abundance from 1yr
   to the next. In this study we: (1) characterize patterns of semi-arid
   forb diversity and abundance over time; (2) determine the relative
   importance of direct vs indirect (via grass competition) effects of
   precipitation on forb richness and abundance; and (3) separate the
   effect of precipitation timing on forb community composition from the
   effects of precipitation amount and season.
   LocationSemi-arid grassland, Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, Socorro
   County, central New Mexico, USA.
   MethodsWe analysed forb dynamics along two 400-m long line-intercept
   transects in response to inter-annual and seasonal precipitation
   variability and abundance of perennial grasses using a unique 20-yr
   species composition data set from ungrazed native grassland in the
   northern Chihuahuan Desert.
   ResultsForb richness and cover were significantly positively associated
   with precipitation across seasons. Total richness was high across the
   time series but substantially lower within any given year. A direct,
   positive effect of precipitation overrode any potential negative,
   indirect effect via grass competition. Although aggregate forb responses
   were strongly linked with precipitation, individual species responses
   were highly variable and generally not linked with either precipitation
   timing or season.
   ConclusionsIn the hotter, drier climate predicted by meteorological
   models for the US southwest, forbs may be negatively impacted if winter
   moisture decreases and monsoon precipitation becomes more variable. On
   the other hand, the flexibility exhibited by forbs in germination and
   establishment throughout the growing season may help buffer some common
   species to increased inter-annual precipitation variability.}},

Title = {{Time lags in functional response to management regimes - evidence from a
   26-year field experiment in wet meadows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{313-324}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Questions(1) How does functional composition and diversity respond to
   different timings and frequencies of mowing or fallow treatment; (2) to
   which species assembly and related ecosystem processes do these
   developments correspond; and (3) what is the time course of these
   developments, and do they reach a stable state?
   LocationNorth-western Germany.
   MethodsIn 1987, a field experiment in nine wet meadow sites formerly
   exploited as fertilized meadows or pastures was established with four
   management treatments: (1) mowing twice a year in June/July and in
   September, (2) mowing once a year in June/July, (3) mowing once a year
   in September, and (4) leaving fallow except for shrub removal.
   Vegetation was recorded at least every second year and the functional
   composition (CWM) and diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy) were analysed
   in the course of the experiment. We selected eight plant functional
   traits (Canopy height, SLA, LDMC, Seed mass, Shoot cyclicity, Clonal
   index, Onset of flowering, Leaf distribution) capturing the main plant
   life strategies.
   ResultsTemporal changes, fluctuations and divergences between treatments
   could be observed in both functional composition and diversity. In
   particular, the vegetation of the fallow treatment showed strong
   competition for light and a higher investment into internal nutrient
   cycling. Over time, all treatments respond towards more stressful
   conditions due to generally less intensive management compared with the
   former management and respective nutrient depletion, leading to a more
   nutrient-retentive and patch-holding strategy and little investment into
   competitive seedlings. High competition and loose abiotic filters in the
   fallow treatment led to a niche separation in foliar traits. Mowing on
   the other hand enforced a divergence of reproduction mechanisms.
   ConclusionWe detected long-term fluctuations and on-going changes in
   functional composition and diversity even after 26yr. Especially early
   succession was characterized by a transient loss of functional
   diversity, caused by strong time lags in immigration and extinction of
   species. Our findings stress the importance of long-term experimental
   studies to avoid precarious misinterpretations.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsIn pasture-dominated landscapes, endozoochory by large
   herbivores is an important vector of plant dispersal. Conditions
   influencing the potential for endozoochorous dispersal of plant species
   by grazers are, however, still poorly known. Here, we assess the impact
   of feeding habits and functional traits on the likelihood of
   endozoochorous dispersal by cattle (ruminants) and horses
   (non-ruminants).
   LocationPasture of 27ha in NW Germany, year-round grazed by free-ranging
   cattle and horses.
   MethodsVegetation releves were established in 45 plots, from which dung
   samples of cattle and horses were collected. The number and composition
   of seedlings emerging from dung samples were compared with the
   vegetation of the study site in terms of plant functional trait
   composition. For the first time, feeding habits were included in the
   analysis. GLMs were used to identify traits that increased the potential
   for endozoochorous dispersal.
   ResultsA total of 65 species germinated from the dung samples. These
   species had higher average fodder and nutrient indicator values than the
   species composition of the vegetation. In particular, species found in
   horse dung were more tolerant of grazing and had more elongated seeds.
   The likelihood of endozoochorous dispersal was higher for common than
   for rare species and was influenced by feeding habits.
   ConclusionsThe likelihood of plant species being dispersed
   endozoochorously can be linked to different functional traits and is
   dependent on the type of grazer and the population size of target
   species in the vegetation. Differences between cattle and horses in seed
   dispersal may result from species-specific grazing habits and different
   digestion modes.}},

Title = {{Experimentally reducing species abundance indirectly affects food web
   structure and robustness}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{327-336}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Studies on the robustness of ecological communities suggest that the
   loss or reduction in abundance of individual species can lead to
   secondary and cascading extinctions. However, most such studies have
   been simulation-based analyses of the effect of primary extinction on
   food web structure.
   2. In a field experiment we tested the direct and indirect effects of
   reducing the abundance of a common species, focusing on the diverse and
   self-contained assemblage of arthropods associated with an abundant
   Brazilian shrub, Baccharis dracunculifolia D.C. (Asteraceae).
   3. Over a 5-month period we experimentally reduced the abundance of
   Baccharopelma dracunculifoliae (Sternorrhyncha: Psyllidae), the
   commonest galling species associated with B. dracunculifolia, in 15
   replicate plots paired with 15 control plots. We investigated direct
   effects of the manipulation on parasitoids attacking B.
   dracunculifoliae, as well as indirect effects (mediated via a third
   species or through the environment) on 10 other galler species and 50
   associated parasitoid species.
   4. The experimental manipulation significantly increased parasitism on
   B. dracunculifoliae in the treatment plots, but did not significantly
   alter either the species richness or abundance of other galler species.
   Compared to control plots, food webs in manipulated plots had
   significantly lower values of weighted connectance, interaction evenness
   and robustness (measured as simulated tolerance to secondary
   extinction), even when B. dracunculifoliae was excluded from
   calculations.
   5. Parasitoid species were almost entirely specialized to individual
   galler species, so the observed effects of the manipulation on food web
   structure could not have propagated via the documented trophic links.
   Instead, they must have spread either through trophic links not included
   in the webs (e.g. shared predators) or non-trophically (e.g. through
   changes in habitat availability). Our results highlight that the
   inclusion of both trophic and non-trophic direct and indirect
   interactions is essential to understand the structure and dynamics of
   even apparently discrete ecological communities.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},

Volume = {{207}},
Pages = {{90-99}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Traditional rural biotopes (TRBs), which are biologically and culturally
   valuable habitats maintained by low-intensity grazing and mowing, are a
   core element of biodiversity in Europe. During the last decades, TRBs
   have faced severe habitat loss and fragmentation due to agricultural
   modernization. Despite their well-known critical state, their
   conservation remains inadequate, thus raising a need to advance TRB
   conservation via spatial land-use planning. In this study we analyze a
   national GIS database on TRBs in order to examine how the current TRB
   network can be complemented in terms of conservation value based on
   known ecological characteristics. Given different target scenarios for
   the amount of managed TRBs, we demonstrate where management should be
   directed to both on protected and unprotected areas. We conclude that in
   current state, biodiversity depending on TRB management is not
   efficiently sustained in Finland. Substantial amount of TRB habitats and
   populations of threatened TRB species are left unmanaged. Based on our
   results, we suggest that to advance TRB conservation in Finland, the
   cover of managed TRBs should be rapidly extended to form ecologically
   functional networks. The expansion would prioritize additional
   management to the Baltic Sea coast and smaller clusters within inland
   Finland, double the cover of managed TRBs, and direct management
   subsidies in a more cost-effective way. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Ecological interactions between fire and grazing have shaped the
   evolutionary history of grassland ecosystems. Currently, grassland birds
   have experienced ongoing population declines, following widespread
   implementation of intensive rangeland management practices that reduce
   habitat heterogeneity. Patch-burn grazing is an alternative rangeland
   management strategy that promotes habitat heterogeneity and
   biodiversity. We conducted a 3-yr. field study in the central Flint
   Hills of Kansas to compare the spatial ecology of female Greater
   Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) in rangelands managed with
   intensive rangeland management versus patch-burn grazing. This is the
   first study on the effects of patch-burn grazing on the space use
   decisions of Greater Prairie-Chickens at the home range scale. We used
   seasonal estimates of home range for 6-mo breeding and nonbreeding
   periods, as well as resource utilization functions to investigate the
   response of female prairie chickens to landscape metrics describing
   fire, grazing, and proximity to anthropogenic structures or lek sites.
   In our analysis of all radio-marked females, distance to lek was
   consistently the strongest predictor of space use during both breeding
   and nonbreeding seasons. Females captured at properties managed with
   patch-burn grazing selected areas with low stocking rates and high fire
   frequencies, and they avoided recently burned areas. Our study provides
   new evidence that patch-burn grazing can improve grassland habitat for
   Greater Prairie-Chickens, an umbrella species in the tallgrass prairie
   ecosystem. Patch-burn grazing created preferred habitats for female
   Greater Prairie-Chickens, with a relatively frequent fire return
   interval, a mosaic of burned and unburned patches, and a reduced
   stocking rate in unburned areas avoided by grazers. Widespread
   implementation of patch-burn grazing could result in significant
   improvements in habitat quality for wildlife in the tallgrass prairie
   ecosystem. (C) 2017 The Society for Range Management. Published by

Abstract = {{Extensive grazing applied in the form of low instantaneous pressure over
   a long period is a widespread management practice in protected areas.
   However this kind of stocking method does not always achieve the
   expected results, in particular because it fails to limit colonization
   by woody plants.This is the case in the relict xero-halophytic
   grasslands of the northern Mediterranean coastal region, subjected to
   widespread colonization by the shrub Phillyrea angustifolia despite the
   presence of extensive grazing. In this study, we investigated, for an
   equal annual stocking rate, the respective impact of high stocking
   density applied over a short period (mob grazing) and low stocking
   density applied over a long period on both P. angustifolia and
   herbaceous cover, using an in situ experimental design run for 7 years.
   Only mob grazing was effective both in controlling the establishment and
   increasing the mortality of P. angustifolia individuals. We did not find
   any difference after the 7 years of experimentation between the two
   stocking methods with regard to the herbaceous community parameters
   tested: species richness, diversity, evenness, contribution of annual
   characteristic species. By contrast, the exclusion of domestic grazing
   led to a strong reduction of these values.The use of mob grazing may be
   well suited for meeting conservation goals such as maintaining open
   habitats in these grasslands.}},

Volume = {{32}},

Abstract = {{Beyond the recognized importance of protecting large areas of contiguous
   habitat, conservation efforts for many species are complicated by the
   fact that patch suitability may also be affected by characteristics of
   the landscape within which the patch is located. Currently, little is
   known about the spatial scales at which species respond to different
   aspects of the landscape surrounding an occupied patch.
   Using grassland bird point count data, we describe an approach to
   evaluating scale-specific effects of landscape composition on patch
   occupancy.
   We used data from 793 point count surveys conducted in idle and grazed
   grasslands across Wisconsin, USA from 2012 to 2014 to evaluate
   scale-dependencies in the response of grassland birds to landscape
   composition. Patch occupancy models were used to evaluate the
   relationship between occupancy and landscape composition at scales from
   100 to 3000 m.
   Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) exhibited a pattern indicating
   selection for grassland habitats in the surrounding landscape at all
   spatial scales while selecting against other habitats. Eastern
   Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) displayed evidence of scale sensitivity for
   all habitat types. Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) showed a
   strong positive response to pasture and idle grass at all scales and
   negatively to cropland at large scales. Unlike other species, patch
   occupancy by Henslow's Sparrow (A. henslowii) was primarily influenced
   by patch area.
   Our results suggest that both working grasslands (pasture) and idle
   conservation grasslands can play an important role in grassland bird
   conservation but also highlight the importance of considering
   species-specific patch and landscape characteristics for effective
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation management is expected to increase local biodiversity, but
   uniform management may lead to biotic homogenization and diversity
   losses at the regional scale. We evaluated the effects of renewed
   grazing and cutting management carried out across a whole region, on the
   diversity of plants and seven arthropod groups. Changes in occurrence
   over 17 years of intensive calcareous grassland management were analysed
   at the species level, which gave insight into the exact species
   contributing to regional homogenization or differentiation. Reponses
   were compared between species differing in habitat affinity, dispersal
   ability, food specialisation and trophic level. Local species richness
   increased over the sampling period for true bugs and millipedes, while
   carabid beetles and weevils declined in local species richness. Species
   richness remained unchanged for plants, woodlice, ants and spiders.
   Regional diversity and compositional variation generally followed local
   patterns. Diversity shifts were only to a limited extent explained by
   species' habitat affinity, dispersal ability, trophic level and food
   specialisation. We conclude that implementation of relatively uniform
   conservation management across a region did not lead to uniform changes
   in local species composition. This is an encouraging result for
   conservation managers, as it shows that there is not necessarily a
   conflict of interest between local and regional conservation goals. Our
   study also demonstrates that shifts in diversity patterns differ
   markedly between taxonomic groups. Single traits provide only limited
   understanding of these differences. This highlights the need for a wide
   taxonomic scope when evaluating conservation management and demonstrates
   the need to understand the mechanisms underlying occurrence shifts.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Species composition of grasslands and pastures is an important control
   on biomass production and ecological functioning, with a significant
   role of grasses and legumes. A change in composition of legumes/grasses
   abundance and biomass ratio results in altered nutrient cycling and
   composition of higher trophic-level communities (e.g., grazers).
   However, in addition to pasturing and fire effects, other parameters may
   also potentially affect grassland composition. Grasses are known as
   silicon (Si) accumulators and legumes as calcium (Ca) accumulators. We
   propose a new testable hypothesis, and a conceptual model, on the role
   of Si/Ca availability in controlling legume/grass dominance/competition
   in grassland systems. Based on available literature, we argue that Si/Ca
   availability is an important trigger for shifts in abundance of both
   plant families. The differential uptake of Si and Ca by legumes and
   grasses affects grassland biogeochemistry and microbial (fungal)
   biomass. In addition, altered litter stoichiometry, through impact of Ca
   and Si uptake on N, C, and P turnover, affects the decomposition
   processes.}},

Abstract = {{Species-rich oligotrophic meadows are affected by a wide range of
   management interventions that influence their functioning and capacity
   to deliver ecosystem services, but long-term studies on the above- and
   belowground adaptations to different management tools are still scarce.
   We focused on the interactive effects of NPK fertilization, mowing, and
   removal of the initially dominant species (Molinia caerulea) on plant,
   soil, and microbial responses in wet oligotrophic grassland in a 16-year
   full-factorial manipulative experiment. Changes in vegetation
   composition, soil pH, and nutrient availability were accompanied by
   altered microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) composition, whereas
   treatment effects on soil microbial biomass and carbon (C)
   mineralization were mainly related to changes in soil organic matter
   (SOM) content and nutrient availability. Fertilization decreased plant
   species richness aboveground and lowered SOM storage and microbial
   activity belowground. Mowing preserved high plant diversity and led to
   more efficient recycling of N within the grassland, whereas Molinia
   removal significantly affected only plant community composition. Mowing
   combined with fertilization maintained high species richness only in the
   short term. Belowground, mowing reduced N leaching from the fertilized
   system but did not prevent SOM depletion, soil acidification, and
   concomitant adverse effects on soil microbes. We conclude that annual
   mowing is the appropriate type of extensive management for oligotrophic
   species-rich meadows, but the concomitant nutrient depletion should not
   be compensated for by regular NPK fertilization due to its adverse
   effects on soil quality.}},

Title = {{Biotic interaction effects on seedling recruitment along bioclimatic
   gradients: testing the stress-gradient hypothesis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{347-356}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{QuestionsIs there a shift from positive to negative biotic interaction
   effects on seedling recruitment along two different stress gradients,
   temperature and precipitation (the stress-gradient hypothesis); do such
   interaction effects differ between species with different bioclimatic
   affinities?
   LocationBoreal, sub-alpine and alpine grassland in southern Norway.
   MethodsWe tested the stress-gradient hypothesis by comparing seedling
   recruitment in bare-ground gaps where vegetation has been removed vs in
   extant grassland vegetation in 12 boreal, sub-alpine and alpine
   grassland sites along a precipitation gradient. This was tested in (1) a
   seed-sowing experiment and (2) in naturally occurring recruitment of
   alpine, generalist and boreal species.
   ResultsEmergence of the sown alpine species was higher in the cold
   alpine than in the warmer sub-alpine sites, with no effects of
   precipitation or vegetation removal. The sown generalists also decreased
   in emergence towards warmer sites, whereas there was no effect of
   temperature on the sown boreal species. Vegetation removal, interacting
   with precipitation, increased the emergence of the generalist and boreal
   species sown at intermediate precipitation levels. In contrast,
   interactions between temperature and vegetation removal regulated the
   emergence of all groups of naturally occurring seedlings. Alpine and
   generalist species emerged at the highest rate in alpine sites, whereas
   boreal species had highest emergence in the lowlands.
   ConclusionFor all species groups, strong effects of vegetation removal
   show that competition from the extant vegetation dominates in
   controlling seedling emergence across all study sites and species. In
   generalist and boreal species, positive interactions between vegetation
   removal and temperature show that competitive interactions affect
   seedling emergence more strongly towards warmer climates, in line with
   the stress-gradient hypothesis. In contrast, alpine species show no such
   interactions. This suggests that species' adaptations to climate, in
   combination with environmental forcing, control seedling emergence along
   the bioclimatic gradients. Our results have implications for nature
   conservation, as we propose that disturbance from grazing animals can be
   useful to release competition and thereby increase seedling recruitment
   and biodiversity in boreal and alpine grasslands in a warmer future.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the influence of habitat heterogeneity,
   inter-habitat connectivity, and biogeograhical patterns in the context
   of a biodiversity hotspot in an Atlantic-Mediterranean marine transition
   area. We analyzed some biological and ecological aspects of molluscan
   assemblages inhabiting different habitats located in the northwestern
   Alboran Sea, in order to elucidate the inter-habitat connectivity among
   coastal habitats, and to understand the contribution of each habitat to
   the integrity of the infralittoral ecosystem. The assessment of
   molluscan assemblages was performed by combining information regarding
   (1) feeding guilds, to analyze trophic strategies; (2) microhabitat
   preference, to study the link between habitat heterogeneity with
   biodiversity; and (3) biogeographical affinities, to identify
   distributional patterns of molluscs. A total of 354 molluscs were
   identified, with vegetated habitats harbouring the highest number of
   species. A wide variety of trophic strategies were observed, with
   infaunal filter feeders, specialized carnivores living on sessile
   invertebrates and microalgal grazers dominating the assemblages. Most of
   the species have a wide distribution while few strictly Mediterranean
   species have been collected. The presence of subtropical species
   highlights the uniqueness of this area in European seas. The high
   beta-diversity value obtained is indicative of high habitat
   heterogeneity and a high amount of uncommon species, some of them
   displaying their sole European populations. The different assemblages
   enrich the global taxocoenosis through complementarity, with an
   important inter-habitat connectivity reflected by the different temporal
   ordination of samples according to both microhabitat affinities and
   feeding guilds. This work highlights the balanced contribution of soft
   and vegetated bottoms as reservoirs of biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural abandonment is a major driver of change in rural
   landscapes. Assumed to provide beneficial results to the environment and
   the conservation of biota, rural abandonment triggers landscape and
   biotic homogenization and loss of valuable species and habitats. This
   article focuses on the ecological effects and conservation challenges of
   shifts in extensive grazing regimes on marginal pastureland of
   Mediterranean mountains. We conceptualize a navigated socioecological
   transition toward conservation-oriented management after the collapse of
   historical land systems. The article provides examples from the LIFE1+
   project ``Higro,{''} developed in mountainous protected areas in
   Portugal, of how management for conservation could sustain
   disturbance-dependent habitats. We argue that actively and regularly
   managing large habitat areas should be envisaged as a short-term
   approach to limit the immediate effects of rural abandonment. A gradual
   integration of conservation targets with other activities in changing
   rural economies is necessary to foster long-term conservation of species
   and habitats, building on the link between conservation-oriented habitat
   management and ecosystem services in rural landscapes. Conservation
   goals should run alongside recovery of social systems and innovation
   applied to traditional sources of income. This parallel development
   would contribute to building up social-ecological resilience by
   maintaining a diversity of social and ecological capital in rural areas.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands worldwide are suffering from overgrazing, which greatly
   alters plant community structure and ecosystem functioning. However, the
   general effects of grazing on community structure and ecosystem function
   at spatial and temporal scales has rarely been examined synchronously in
   the same grassland. Here, during 2011-2013, we investigated community
   structure (cover, height, and species richness) and aboveground biomass
   (AGB) using 250 paired field sites (grazed vs. fenced) across three
   vegetation types (meadow, typical, and desert steppes) on the Inner
   Mongolian Plateau. Grazing, vegetation type, and year all had
   significant effects on cover, height, species richness, and AGB,
   although the primary factor influencing variations in these variables
   was vegetation type. Spatially, grazing significantly reduced the
   measured variables in meadow and typical steppes, whereas no changes
   were observed in desert steppe. Temporally, both linear and quadratic
   relationships were detected between growing season precipitation and
   cover, height, richness, or AGB, although specific relationships varied
   among observation years and grazing treatments. In each vegetation type,
   the observed community properties were significantly correlated with
   each other, and the shape of the relationship was unaffected by grazing
   treatment. These findings indicate that vegetation type is the most
   important factor to be considered in grazing management for this
   semi-arid grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial properties of landscapes modify the abundance and diversity of

   Seascape context (i.e. the spatial arrangement of ecosystems) mediates
   the effects of reserves on fish abundance, species richness and
   ecological processes in shallow coral reef and mangrove ecosystems;
   however, it is unclear whether this interaction exerts similar effects
   on reserves in other ecosystems. This study used baited remote

   seascape context and reserves on fish abundance in seagrass meadows in
   Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. We demonstrate that the composition
   of harvested fishes in seagrass meadows was different in reserves and
   fished areas. Specifically, in reserves there was enhanced abundance of
   exploited rabbitfish Siganus fuscescens, a functionally important
   herbivore in local seagrass meadows. These reserve effects are not
   influenced by the area of seagrass meadows or seascape context they
   occur in (i.e. their spatial proximity to other ecosystems or the
   ocean). However, seascape context was directly correlated with the
   spatial distribution of harvested rabbitfish and emperors Lethrinus
   spp., which were more abundant in seagrass meadows nearer to the open
   ocean. Our results show that reserves and seascape context can shape
   spatial patterns in the abundance of harvested fishes in seagrass
   meadows, and that these effects may be operating on different components
   of fish assemblages. Further empirical data on how and where seascape
   features modify reserve performance are critical for effective
   conservation in seagrass and related ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Several pasture improvement methods were compared over three years in
   the humid temperate region of southern Chile. The control treatment was
   non fertilized naturalized pasture (NFP), and the improvement treatments
   included fertilized naturalized pasture (FP), sown with L. perenne - T
   repens (Mixed), and sown with a four-species mixture (Diverse), in a
   randomized complete block design. Decision tree modelling was used to
   predict the relative abundance of the functional groups: high fertility
   response grasses (HFRG), low fertility response grasses (LFRG), legumes
   and flatweeds. The fitted model output Was contrasted with regression
   models. Soil chemical and physical variables and pasture attributes were
   measured. The ranking of annual dry herbage mass by the third year was
   Diverse > FP > Mixed > NFP, with Diverse being dominated by HFRG (68\%)
   and NFP by flatweeds (50\%). The decision tree models indicated the main
   factors influencing the abundance of functional groups were soil
   Olsen-P, soil mineral nitrogen and soil pHwater. For HFRG, the increase
   of soil mineral nitrogen (>45.1 mg kg(-1)) was the strongest variable to
   stimulate their abundance, for LFRG and flatweeds it was low soil
   Olsen-P (<9.2 mg kg(-1)), while for legumes it was the increase in soil
   pHwater (>5.6). The decision tree model performed better than the
   regression model with respect to model fit. Decision tree modeling can
   be used to set soil fertility targets according to a determined
   objective for pasture functional group abundance. The successful
   integration of environmental variables influencing the abundance of
   functional groups with decision tree models provided a new approach to
   the sustainable management of pasture functional groups. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{There is ongoing concern regarding the observed decline in pollinator
   populations. Managing agricultural landscapes through agri-environment
   schemes (AES) supports biodiversity and could counteract pollinator
   population declines. We investigated whether alterations to current AES
   grassland mowing regimes would increase the abundance and species
   richness of wild bees and hoverflies. Furthermore, we investigated the
   response of different nesting and feeding guilds of wild bees and
   hoverfiies, respectively, to these regimes. The three experimental
   mowing regimes were: (i) first cut not before 15 June, before the
   beginning of summer (Swiss AES management, control meadows); (ii) first
   cut delayed until 15 July (delayed meadows); (iii) as for control
   meadows but leaving 10-20\% uncut as a refuge (refuge meadows). The
   rationale behind the delayed and refuge mowing regimes was extending the
   availability of floral resources for pollinators, while also providing
   refugia for species that may be directly impacted by mowing. Hoverflies
   and wild bees were collected in 2014 and 2015, respectively, using
   pan-trapping and sweep-netting, once before and once after the first
   cut. The two collecting methods showed contrasting results. While there
   was no difference in the abundance or richness of wild bees between the
   meadows when using pan traps, following the first cut, sweep-netting
   resulted in a higher abundance and richness of wild bees in delayed and
   refuge meadows compared to control meadows. Pan-trapping detected a
   higher abundance of hoverflies in delayed compared to refuge meadows,
   whereas sweep-netting detected a higher abundance in delayed and refuge
   compared to control meadows, after the first cut. Saprophagous
   hoverflies were more abundant in the control and delayed than refuge
   meadows following the first cut, when sampled with pan traps. Predatory
   hoverfiies were more abundant and species rich in delayed and refuge
   compared to control meadows following the first cut, when sampled by
   sweep netting. Our study demonstrates that simple alterations to a
   common AES grassland mowing regime can enhance populations of
   pollinators and natural enemies of crop pests. Furthermore, the
   contrasting response of the life-history guilds indicates that promoting
   heterogeneous management practices Within the landscape is important for
   supporting diverse communities, and maintaining key ecosystem services
   such as pollination and biocontrol. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{239}},
Pages = {{112-118}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Land use and climate are important drivers of the diversity and
   abundance of insects. Tabanids (Diptera: Tabanidae) are haematophagous
   cosmopolitan flies that are pests to humans and livestock as well as
   mechanical vectors of animal disease agents such as Besnoitia besnoiti
   and the equine infectious anaemia virus. Given growing concerns about
   tabanid-borne diseases in Europe, there is a need to assess how land use
   and climate affect tabanid assemblages on the European scale. To
   investigate this, we used a dataset including 38 tabanid samples from 7
   European countries to determine the geographical distribution of 79
   tabanid species, and a dataset restricted to 32 samples from 4 countries
   to examine the relationship between tabanid assemblages and climatic and
   land-use variables. We also investigated the impact of the sampling
   method on findings. On the European scale, a non-metric multidimensional
   scaling (NMDS) ordination revealed that tabanid assemblages were
   spatially ordered along a marked gradient from Eastern to Western
   Europe. A model-based analysis of the multivariate tabanid abundance
   data showed that both climatic and landscape variables, but not sampling
   method, had a significant additive effect on mean abundance. Using
   linear mixed-effects models, we found that the Shannon diversity index
   decreased from 2.5 to 0.5 when the percentage of pastureland in a 2-km
   buffer around the sampling site increased from 0 to 80\% and the annual
   mean temperature decreased from 16 to 4 degrees C, while Pielou's
   measure of species evenness decreased from 0.94 to 0.18 with an increase
   in the percentage of pastureland. We found that the community proportion
   of the two most common European species, Tabanus bromius and Haematopota
   pluvialis, was significantly associated with the sampling method. Our
   results indicate that the distribution and incidence of tabanid-borne
   diseases may be heavily influenced by changes in land use and climate
   and highlight the importance of environmental changes on insect vector
   populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the factors that determine habitat quality is of vital
   importance in ensuring appropriate habitat management. Here we used the
   Niobe fritillary (Argynnis niobe) as a study system to analyse the
   larval habitat preferences in a small network of heavy-metal grasslands
   in western Germany. The data were compared with the results of a
   previous study in coastal dune grasslands of the German North Sea. Based
   on this knowledge, we give management recommendations for the
   conservation of this threatened species. The key factors for the
   survival of A. niobe in heavy-metal grasslands were (i) open vegetation
   with a warm microclimate and (ii) sufficient host plants for the larvae.
   This reflects similar results from the previous study in coastal grey
   dune grasslands. However, in the heavy-metal grasslands, physiological
   stress generally slows down succession and favours the fritillary's host
   plant, the metallophyte Viola calaminaria. As a result, the cover of the
   host plant was nearly twice as high in heavy-metal grasslands compared
   to the dune grasslands. Heavy-metal grasslands are of great significance
   for the conservation of A. niobe and overall butterfly diversity.
   Usually, the speed of succession in heavy-metal grasslands is slow and,
   hence, sites with high heavy-metal concentrations are characterised by
   relatively stable plant composition and vegetation structure. However,
   on soils with low heavy-metal content a loss of habitats of A. niobe and
   associated species of conservation concern may occur without management.
   On those sites sheep grazing seems to be an appropriate way to keep the
   habitats open and rich in violets.}},

Title = {{Population dynamics and future persistence of the clouded Apollo
   butterfly in southern Scandinavia: The importance of low intensity
   grazing and creation of habitat patches}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{206}},
Pages = {{120-131}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We investigated the population dynamics and future persistence of the
   last remaining Clouded Apollo butterfly metapopulation in southern
   Scandinavia. Based on three decades of surveys (1984-2015), we modelled
   colonization-extinction dynamics and local population sizes using
   habitat patch characteristics and connectivity, while accounting for
   imperfect detection and uncertainty in the local population sizes. The
   colonization probability increased with increasing connectivity and the
   local extinction probability decreased with increasing local population
   size in accordance with metapopulation theory. The local population size
   increased with increasing patch area, and was also affected by grazing
   intensity. Light grazing resulted in larger local populations compared
   to heavy grazing or no grazing at all. The butterfly population has
   decreased considerably during the study period and according to
   projections of future dynamics the estimated extinction risk within the
   coming 10 years is 17\%. However, it is possible to change the negative
   trends and decrease the extinction risk considerably by conservation
   actions. By optimizing the grazing pressure in existing patches the
   extinction risk was reduced to 11\% (a reduction with 35\% compared to
   the scenario with no conservation action). If a few new patches are
   created close to the occupied ones the extinction risk can be reduced
   further. In conclusion, there is a large risk that the Clouded Apollo
   butterfly will go extinct from southern Scandinavia within the coming
   decade. However, conservation measures that are focused to the core area
   of the current distribution and applied soon can considerably improve
   the situation for the butterfly. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The impacts of Cenozoic climate and habitat changes on small mammal
   diversity of North America}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{149}},
Pages = {{36-52}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Through the Cenozoic, paleoclimate records show general trends of global
   cooling and increased aridity, and environments in North America shifted
   from predominantly forests to more open habitats. Paleobotanical records
   indicate grasses were present on the continent in the Eocene; however,
   paleosol and phytolith studies indicate that open habitats did not arise
   until the late Eocene or even later in the Oligocene. Studies of large
   mammalian herbivores have documented changes in ecomorphology and
   community structure through time, revealing that shifts in mammalian
   morphology occurred millions of years after the environmental changes
   thought to have triggered them. Smaller mammals, like rodents and
   lagomorphs, should more closely track climate and habitat changes due to
   their shorter generation times and smaller ranges, but these animals
   have received much less study. To examine changes in smaller mammals
   through time; we have assembled and analyzed an ecomorphological
   database of all North American rodent and lagomorph species.
   Analyses of these data found that rodent and lagomorph community
   structure changed dramatically through the Cenozoic, and shifts in
   diversity and ecology correspond closely with the timing of habitat
   changes. Cenozoic rodent and lagomorph species diversity is strongly
   biased by sampling of localities, but sampling-corrected diversity
   reveals diversity dynamics that, after an initial density-dependent
   diversification in the Eocene, track habitat changes and the appearance
   of new ecological adaptations. As habitats became more open and arid
   through time, rodent and lagomorph crown heights increased while
   burrowing, jumping, and cursorial adaptations became more prevalent.
   Through time, open-habitat specialists were added during periods of
   diversification, while closed-habitat taxa were disproportionately lost
   in subsequent diversity declines. While shifts among rodents and
   lagomorphs parallel changes in ungulate communities, they started
   millions of years earlier than in larger mammals. This is likely a
   consequence of the smaller mammals' greater sensitivity to environmental
   changes and more rapid evolution. These results highlight the importance
   of examining understudied members of vertebrate faunas for understanding
   the evolution of terrestrial communities through time. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Short-term herbivory has long-term consequences in warmed and ambient
   high Arctic tundra}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is occurring across the world, with effects varying by
   ecosystem and region but already occurring quickly in high-latitude and
   high-altitude regions. Biotic interactions are important in determining
   ecosystem response to such changes, but few studies have been long-term
   in nature, especially in the High Arctic. Mesic tundra plots on
   Svalbard, Norway, were subjected to grazing at two different intensities
   by captive Barnacle geese from 2003-2005, in a factorial design with
   warming by Open Top Chambers. Warming manipulations were continued
   through 2014, when we measured vegetation structure and composition as
   well as growth and reproduction of three dominant species in the mesic
   meadow. Significantly more dead vascular plant material was found in
   warmed compared to ambient plots, regardless of grazing history, but in
   contrast to many short-term experiments no difference in the amount of
   living material was found. This has strong implications for nutrient and
   carbon cycling and could feed back into community productivity. Dominant
   species showed increased flowering in warmed plots, especially in those
   plots where grazing had been applied. However, this added sexual
   reproduction did not translate to substantial shifts in vegetative
   cover. Forbs and rushes increased slightly in warmed plots regardless of
   grazing, while the dominant shrub, Salix polaris, generally declined
   with effects dependent on grazing, and the evergreen shrub Dryas
   octopetala declined with previous intensive grazing. There were no
   treatment effects on community diversity or evenness. Thus despite no
   changes in total live abundance, a typical short-term response to
   environmental conditions, we found pronounced changes in dead biomass
   indicating that tundra ecosystem processes respond to medium-to
   long-term changes in conditions caused by 12 seasons of summer warming.
   We suggest that while high arctic tundra plant communities are fairly
   resistant to current levels of climate warming, underlying ecosystem
   processes are beginning to change. In addition, even short bouts of
   intense herbivory can have long-term consequences for some species in
   these communities.}},

Abstract = {{Deposition of nitrogen is assumed to cause loss of botanical diversity,
   probably through increased production and exclusion of less competitive
   species. However, if production is (co-)limited by phosphorus,
   acceleration of the phosphorus cycle may be responsible for the
   diversity loss and, where that is the case, nitrogen emission reduction
   may turn out to be an ineffective mitigation strategy. Here we study the
   feasibility of this mechanism through adding potassium and phosphorus to
   grassland where nitrogen limitation is absent.
   We made vegetation relev,s in a long-term agricultural fertilisation
   experiment where potassium, phosphorus and nitrogen were being added to
   grassland on drained peat where nitrogen availability was high, even in
   unfertilised plots. We applied a multivariate analysis to investigate
   the effect of additions of K, K + P and K + P + N on the species
   composition.
   Unfertilised plots had a very low biomass production and were rich in
   plant species despite their high nitrogen availability. Addition of
   potassium led to a strongly increased production but did not result in a
   reduction of species numbers. Phosphorus in addition to potassium
   increased production still further and decreased species numbers, most
   notably the number of endangered species.
   Even under nitrogen rich conditions species richness may be high in
   grasslands where phosphorous provides a limitation to plant growth.
   Phosphorus limitation and phosphorus enrichment are both common in
   grassland, at least in north-western Europe. Part of the general
   decrease in species numbers that is commonly ascribed to nitrogen
   enrichment may therefore be due to phosphorus enrichment. If phosphorus
   and nitrogen are co-limiting (which is often the case) the current
   nitrogen emission reduction policies may be effective, but not
   sufficient to restore grassland diversity to its pre-industrial level.}},

Abstract = {{1. Immigration, extirpation and persistence of individual populations of
   species are key processes determining community responses to
   environmental change. However, they are difficult to study over long
   time periods without corresponding historical and modern-day species
   occurrences.
   2. We used historical and present-day plant species occurrence data from
   two different spatial scales (resolutions) to investigate the plant
   community turnover during the 20th century in a Baltic Sea archipelago.
   Patterns of turnover were analysed in relation to plant functional
   traits relating to dispersal and competition/persistence, as well as
   biogeographical variables.
   3. Turnover was largely driven by interactions between functional traits
   and measures of area, connectivity and distance to mainland. However,
   the combinations of traits and biogeographical variables that were most
   important for predicting immigration and extirpation differed between
   data sets, and between species associated with grassland management and
   the entire species pool.
   4. Taller plants were more likely to persist regardless of scale and
   biogeography, reflecting the grazing abandonment that occurred in the
   study area. Interactions between dispersal traits and biogeography were
   related to immigrations when the entire species pool was considered.
   However, increased dispersal potential, a smaller island size and
   increasing distance to mainland combined to promote extirpations in
   management-associated species. A perennial life span and seed banking
   contributed to species persistence. At the larger spatial scale,
   trait-driven turnover was not mediated by the biogeographical context.
   5. We showed that it is important to consider functional traits,
   biogeographical variables and their interactions when analysing
   community turnover over time. Furthermore, we found that the
   understanding of how combinations of traits and biogeography predict
   turnover depends on the source and spatial scale of the available data,
   and the species pool analysed.}},

   rehabilitation of dry alluvial quarries in Southeastern France}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Of the many techniques tested to date to rehabilitate degraded
   ecosystems, topsoil transfer appears to offer the best results. However,
   this method is recent, and results achieved in the short term (months to
   years) may not provide a sound indication of long-term vegetation
   reestablishment. In the plain of La Crau in southeastern France, many
   dry alluvial quarries were exploited in the 1970s-1980s and are nearly
   all now abandoned. Various topsoil transfers were performed when
   operations ceased, for various rehabilitation purposes (aesthetic,
   security, agricultural, etc.) and now provide the opportunity to test
   their efficacy in the 30-year long-term. We used an ecological analysis
   of plant communities and soil carried out in 2015 to compare the
   reference ecosystem (the steppe of La Crau, positive control) with
   un-rehabilitated quarry pits (negative control) and with four different
   rehabilitation treatments: (1) soil transfer (40 cm) with no contact
   with the water table; (2) soil transfer (40 cm) in contact with the
   water table; (3) more than 40 cm of soil transfer and (4) anthropogenic
   material deposits (spoils) unrelated to the characteristics of the
   reference soil. Our results show that the treatment most favorable to
   restoration of the species richness, diversity and composition of the
   steppe vegetation is transferring soil with fine particles (clay, silt)
   (treatment 1), at least 40 cm thick and without contact with
   groundwater. However, even after thirty years, and the re-establishment
   of traditional sheep grazing, full restoration of the reference steppe
   is far from being achieved. The other treatments lead to the emergence
   of hybrid or novel ecosystems, such as temporary ponds, riparian
   woodlands or matorrals with new variables and common variables to the
   historical ecosystem. Additional techniques to enhance the effectiveness
   of topsoil transfer are discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{13-21}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Grazing exclusion has been widely studied to have impacts on grassland
   aboveground community characteristics, however little is known about
   responses of grassland root community to long-term grazing exclusion. We
   selected five grasslands with different grazing exclusion time (0, 5
   years, 9 years, 22 years, and 30 years) to determine root traits
   (biomass, length, surface area) in plant functional group and plant
   community level, soil properties of 0-30 cm depth and relationship
   between root traits and soil properties. Our results showed that grazing
   exclusion increased grassland root biomass, root length density and root
   surface area, accompanying declined plant species richness. After
   grazing exclusion, with perennial bunchgrasses (PB) being predominant in
   root community all the time, proportion of perennial rhizome grasses
   (PR) increased and proportion of perennial forbs (PF) declined. Grasses
   had higher specific root length and specific root surface area than that
   of forbs. Grazing exclusion significantly increased soil water content,
   soil organic carbon, total soil nitrogen and available soil phosphorus.
   Grasses were mainly correlated with soil organic carbon and nitrogen,
   while forbs were mainly influenced by soil phosphorus. Our results
   highlight the grasses' enhancing effect on grassland root productivity,
   and the critical role of soil nitrogen and phosphorus in regulating root
   community compositional changes in semiarid grassland after long-term
   grazing exclusion. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive human activities have resulted in a critical reduction of
   grasslands in Croatia, one of the richest Europian countries in terms of
   biodiversity. Sub-Pannonic steppic grasslands are very rare, only few
   occur in the continental part of Croatia and most of them are protected
   as NATURA 2000 sites. We studied vascular flora of the Sub-Pannonic
   stepic grassland with the aim to examine the changes in plant
   communities 15 years from the mowing application. Results showed that
   hand mowing once per year at the end of vegetation season increased the
   species diversity as well as the number of medium and low growth taxa.
   The critically endangered, nearly threatened and vulnerable species
   remained preserved. The occurrence of trees, shrubs and invasive species
   as a consequence of succession and anthropogenic influences could be
   important threat for steppe-like grassland flora. From a conservation
   point of view infrequent mowing regime could be an effective management
   tool, although it needs to be adapted to regional and local
   circumstances for maintaining high biodiversity of steppe-like
   grasslands and valuable plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Loss and fragmentation of natural habitats can lead to alterations of
   plant-animal interactions and ecosystems functioning. Insect herbivory,
   an important antagonistic interaction is expected to be influenced by
   habitat fragmentation through direct negative effects on herbivore
   community richness and indirect positive effects due to losses of
   natural enemies. Plant community changes with habitat fragmentation
   added to the indirect effects but with little predictable impact. Here,
   we evaluated habitat fragmentation effects on both herbivory and
   herbivore diversity, using novel hierarchical meta-analyses. Across 89
   studies, we found a negative effect of habitat fragmentation on
   abundance and species richness of herbivores, but only a non-significant
   trend on herbivory. Reduced area and increased isolation of remaining
   fragments yielded the strongest effect on abundance and species
   richness, while specialist herbivores were the most vulnerable to
   habitat fragmentation. These fragmentation effects were more pronounced
   in studies with large spatial extent. The strong reduction in herbivore
   diversity, but not herbivory, indicates how important common generalist
   species can be in maintaining herbivory as a major ecosystem process.}},

Abstract = {{Wet grasslands provide unique habitats for several taxa and offer
   multiple ecosystem services. Their degradation is therefore of
   increasing concern in many parts of the world. Baltic coastal meadows,
   which host diverse plant and bird communities and provide an essential
   breeding ground for amphibians, belong to the most threatened habitat
   types in Europe. In spite of the EU agri-environmental schemes, the
   threatened wader and toad populations, characteristic to these meadows,
   have not recovered, suggesting that the management efforts are failing
   to provide sufficiently high habitat quality for these species. In this
   paper we report the results of a large-scale survey determining the
   factors that influence the patterns of breeding habitat selection of
   four Charadriiform bird species on 24 coastal meadows in Estonia. We
   also examined whether the habitat conditions required by the threatened
   waders would benefit breeding amphibians and meadow plants and whether
   the threatened waders might act as focal species for managing coastal
   meadow biodiversity. In total, we analysed 23 landscape-variables,
   applying co inertia analysis to discover common multivariate patterns in
   coastal meadow characteristics, breeding waders, plants and amphibians.
   We demonstrated that large (> 100 ha) and wide (mean width > 200 m)
   meadows with extensive grazing, high water-table and no woody vegetation
   provide favourable breeding conditions for waders of conservation
   concern, but at the same time also support other Charadriiform birds,
   larger amphibian populations, and more diverse plant communities. Meadow
   management should therefore be targeted at threatened waders, especially
   Baltic dunlin, which could be considered as a focal species, and focus
   on the establishment of large and wide meadow areas with extensive
   grazing.(C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Tree diversity increases levels of herbivore damage in a subtropical
   forest canopy: evidence for dietary mixing by arthropods?}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Aims Plant diversity has been linked to both increasing and decreasing
   levels of arthropod herbivore damage in different plant communities. So
   far, these links have mainly been studied in grasslands or in artificial
   tree plantations with low species richness. Furthermore, most studies
   provide results from newly established experimental plant communities
   where trophic links are not fully established or from stands of tree
   saplings that have not yet developed a canopy. Here, we test how tree
   diversity in a species-rich subtropical forest in China with fully
   developed tree canopy affects levels of herbivore damage caused by
   different arthropod feeding guilds.
   Methods We established 27 plots of 30 x 30 m area. The plots were
   selected randomly but with the constraint that they had to span a large
   range of tree diversity as required for comparative studies in contrast
   to sample surveys. We recorded herbivore damage caused by arthropod
   feeding guilds (leaf chewers, leaf skeletonizers and sap feeders) on
   canopy leaves of all major tree species.
   Important Findings Levels of herbivore damage increased with tree
   species richness and tree phylogenetic diversity. These effects were
   most pronounced for damage caused by leaf chewers. Although the two
   diversity measures were highly correlated, we additionally found a
   significant interaction between them, whereby species richness increased
   herbivory mostly at low levels of phylogenetic diversity. Tree species
   with the lowest proportion of canopy leaf biomass in a plot tended to
   suffer the highest levels of herbivore damage, which is in contrast to
   expectations based on the resource concentration hypothesis. Our results
   are in agreement with expectations of the dietary mixing hypothesis
   where generalist herbivores with a broad spectrum of food plants benefit
   from increased resource diversity in tree species-rich forest patches.}},

Abstract = {{The trade-off between plant community structure and function is an
   important issue during grassland restoration. It is essential to assess
   changes of structure and function after converting farmland to
   grassland. Three restoration stages (5, 15, and 30 years) were studied
   to determine the optimum time when the trade-off between diversity and
   productivity occurs. The results showed that the vegetation coverage,
   height, and productivity significantly increased, but the species
   richness, diversity, and density significantly decreased along the
   restoration time. Grassland community presented a succession from small
   individuals and high density to larger individuals and lower density.
   The community changed from being dominated by grass and forb functional
   groups to being dominated only by the grass functional group. The
   dominant grass functional group plays a decisive role on community
   structure and function (productivity, diversity, and density) during
   grassland succession. Our results suggest that community structure and
   function were mainly driven by the dominant grass functional group
   during the long-term succession. Grassland should be utilized to
   suppress the leading role of the dominant functional groups in the 20th
   year for keeping the trade-off of diversity and productivity. We suggest
   that the restoration grassland should be considered to use appropriately
   in the 20th year. Our study could provide a key guidance for maintaining
   the community structure and function trade-off for cropland-converted
   grassland management in the semi-arid areas. Copyright (C) 2016 John

   perceptions of ES from the largest area with oak wood-pasture landscapes
   in Sweden (Ostergotland County). A total of 34 ES were mentioned, and
   compared among stakeholders from public, private and civil sectors at
   local and regional levels of governance. Cultural ES were highlighted
   the most by respondents from both levels of governance. At the local
   level, respondents appreciated especially provisioning services. In
   contrast, regional level respondents showed more appreciation for
   supporting services. Private sector stakeholders emphasized provisioning
   ES, whereas the civil and public sector stakeholders highlighted
   cultural ES in terms of recreational values and landscape beauty.
   Supporting ES were considered only in relation to biodiversity,
   especially species and habitats linked to old oaks. Farmers and farming
   activities (especially grazing regimes) are crucial to support important
   oak wood-pasture ES. We discuss important ES as expressed by
   stakeholders and challengestor wood-pasture conservation in Sweden and
   elsewhere. To integrate the different demands of stakeholder groups into
   policy, enable cross-sectorial flexibility and policy regional
   adaptation for wood-pasture conservation, are current challenges future
   research should focus upon. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We used photo-elicitation studies and a controlled perennial meadow
   creation experiment at ten urban green-spaces in southern England (five
   experimental sites and five control sites) to assess green-space
   visitors' responses to urban meadows. Multiple meadows, which varied in
   their structural diversity (height) and plant species richness, were
   created at each experimental site. Photo elicitation demonstrated that
   meadows were generally preferred to herbaceous borders and formal
   bedding planting. Moreover, our experimental meadows had higher
   preference scores than a treatment that replicated mown amenity
   grassland, and meadow creation improved site quality and appreciation
   across a wide range of people. Meadows that contained more plant species
   and some structural diversity (i.e. were tall or of medium height) were
   most preferred. The magnitude of these preferences was lower amongst
   people that used the sites the most, probably due to a strong attachment
   to the site, i.e. sense of place. People with greater eco-centricity
   (i.e. those who used the countryside more frequently, had greater
   ability to identify plant species and exhibited more support for
   conservation) responded more positively to meadow vegetation. Crucially
   a wide range of respondents was willing to tolerate the appearance of
   meadows outside the flowering season, especially when provided with
   information on their biodiversity and aesthetic benefits and potential
   cost savings (from reduced cutting frequencies). Re-designing urban
   green-spaces and parks through the creation of species rich meadows can
   provide a win-win strategy for biodiversity and people, and potentially
   improve connections between the two. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{579}},
Pages = {{1366-1378}},

Abstract = {{The resilience of constructed wetland ecosystems to severe disturbance,
   such as a mass herbivory eat-out or soil disturbance, remains poorly
   understood. In this study, we use a controlled mesocosm experiment to
   examine how original planting diversity affects the ability of
   constructed freshwater wetlands to recover structurally and functionally
   after a disturbance (i.e., aboveground harvesting and soil coring). We
   assessed if the planting richness of macrophyte species influences
   recovery of constructed wetlands one year after a disturbance. Mesocosms
   were planted in richness groups with various combinations of either 1,
   2, 3, or 4 species (RG 1-4) to create a gradient of richness. Structural
   wetland traits measured include morphological regrowth of macro-phytes,
   soil bulk density, soil moisture, soil \%C, and soil \%N. Functional
   wetland traits measured include above ground biomass production, soil
   potential denitrification, and soil potential microbial respiration.
   Total mesocosm cover increased along the gradient of plant richness
   (43.5\% in RG 1 to 84.5\% in RG 4) in the growing season after the
   disturbance, although not all planted individuals recovered. This was
   largely attributed to the dominance of the obligate annual species. The
   morphology of each species was affected negatively by the disturbance,
   producing shorter, and fewer stems than in the years prior to the
   disturbance, suggesting that the communities had not fully recovered one
   year after the disturbance. Soil characteristics were almost uniform
   across the planting richness gradient, but for a few exceptions (\%C, C:
   N, and non-growing season soil moisture were higher slightly in RG 2).
   Denitrification potential (DEA) increased with increasing planting
   richness and was influenced by the abundance and quality of soil C.
   Increased open space in unplanted mesocosms and mesocosms with lower
   species richness increased labile C, leading to higher C mineralization
   rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Defining and understanding the long-term social and ecological evolution
   of rural cultural landscapes can provide insights into complex dynamics
   of landscape and environment changes. Land cover changes (LCCs) in
   Mediterranean-type ecosystems are mainly due to human-induced landscape
   transformations. Multi-scale spatial analysis can provide useful
   information in the interpretation of LCCs data and contribute to
   identifying underlying drivers of landscape change. In the present
   study, we analyze eight diachronic land cover maps and perform
   statistical data assessments of human pressure in the Tolfa-Cerite
   district (Northern Latium, central Italy) to investigate potential
   changes in the cultural landscape. The Tolfa-Cerite district is a
   generally dry area with subhumid-humid sites and an interesting mosaic
   of Mediterranean-temperate vegetation, agricultural and pastoral land,
   and a millenarian human presence. LCCs were assessed over a period of 57
   years (1949-2006) using maps at both low-resolution (1:100.000) and
   high-resolution (1:25.000) with different class nomenclature systems.
   Three primary land cover changes have been observed during the
   investigated period: (i) urbanization, (ii) land abandonment, and (iii)
   deforestation. While the former two classes of landscape change are
   particularly common in the northern Mediterranean region, forest
   conversion to pastures and shrub lands due to intensive grazing, fires,
   climate aridity, and increasing human pressure is, nowadays, rarely
   observed in Italy. Better understanding the influence of population
   dynamics at the local scale and other drivers of LCCs can help
   finetuning conservation policies looking at landscape quality,
   diversity, and fragmentation.}},

Title = {{The biology and management of prickly paddy melon (Cucumis myriocarpus
   L.), an important summer annual weed in Australia}},
Journal = {{CROP PROTECTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{29-40}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cucumis myriocarpus is an annual cucurbitaceous summer weed infesting
   fallow fields and pastures. Infestation results in reduced moisture
   availability for winter cereal crops as well as reduced crop yields and
   pasture quality. The need to manage this weed is of paramount importance
   given its adverse effects on farming systems, biodiversity and grazing
   livestock and its ranking as the number one weed of importance in
   Australian summer fallows of grain crops. Land management practices,
   including movement of grazing animals and over-stocking, are potentially
   assisting the spread of Cucumis myriocarpus fruits and viable seed. The
   plant is characterized by the presence of small, ellipsoid to spherical
   melon fruits with spiny appendages. Each plant can produce up to 50 or
   more melons per plant, with each fruit containing up to 200 viable
   seeds. Seed is often dormant upon fruit maturity and our results under
   controlled environmental conditions suggest both physiological and
   physical factors influence dormancy. Under field conditions, seedlings
   can form large vines growing upto 3 m in length. Field pollination
   experiments suggest that this melon is mainly self-pollinated by
   insects, including bees, flies and wasps. Cucumis myriocarpus is
   generally managed by the use of various broadleaf phenoxy herbicides and
   systemic post-emergent products. It is found in this study that this
   weed established through multiple flushes of germination, hence multiple
   herbicidal applications coinciding with rainfall events one suggested
   for more efficacious management. However, rotation of infested pastures
   with cereal crops such as canola and wheat also results in improved
   control. Additional studies into the impact of soil with and physical
   properties, disturbance and grazing, are recommended for development of
   more efficacious control measures. This review discusses taxonomy,
   genetic variation, biology and ecology and management of this important
   summer annual weed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{284}},

Abstract = {{The artificial fertilization of soils can alter the structure of natural
   plant communities and exacerbate pathogen emergence and transmission.
   Although the direct effects of fertilization on disease resistance in
   plants have received some research attention, its indirect effects of
   altered community structure on the severity of fungal disease infection
   remain largely uninvestigated. We designed manipulation experiments in
   natural assemblages of Tibetan alpine meadow vegetation along a
   nitrogen-fertilization gradient over 5 years to compare the relative
   importance of direct and indirect effects of fertilization on foliar
   fungal infections at the community level. We found that species with
   lower proneness to pathogens were more likely to be extirpated following
   fertilization, such that community-level competence of disease, and thus
   community pathogen load, increased with the intensity of fertilization.
   The amount of nitrogen added (direct effect) and community disease
   competence (indirect effect) provided the most parsimonious combination
   of parameters explaining the variation in disease severity. Our
   experiment provides a mechanistic explanation for the dilution effect in
   fertilized, natural assemblages in a highly specific pathogen-host
   system, and thus insights into the consequences of human ecosystem
   modifications on the dynamics of infectious diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing and mowing commonly form part of agricultural management.
   Nowadays, these grassland management measures - complemented by low-cost
   treatments such as mulching - often aim at keeping the rural landscape
   open and at avoiding natural succession. The evaluation of these
   treatments has not yet accounted for the long-term perspective
   particularly important for soil phosphorus (P).
   In a four-decade long experiment in Southwestern Germany, the effects of
   mulching and natural succession on labile, moderately labile, and stable
   inorganic (Pi) and organic (Po) P fractions in soil of six sites (three
   in the Black Forest and three at the Swabian Alb) were studied. Our
   objectives were to test i) the effect of mulching or natural succession
   on P fractions in soil, and ii) whether the temporal development of P
   fractions in soil differs among mulching treatments and natural
   succession up to 40 years after abandonment of former land use. Special
   emphasis was paid to differences in bedrock combined with water regime.
   Soils developed on non-calcareous bedrock showed higher labile Po
   concentrations as compared to those developed on calcareous bedrock
   caused by reduced decomposition induced by water saturation and low
   quality of plant material. The normalization of P fractions to the
   respective site average revealed that mulching twice a year reduced
   concentrations of labile and moderately labile Pi, stable and total P in
   soil likely attributable to vertical transport of Pi. Comparing soil P
   fractions in 2014 to those of archived samples of 1975, succession
   resulted in a decrease in labile P fractions and increase in stable P
   fractions over time which could be explained by processes during soil
   development. Such processes were less pronounced in the mulching
   treatment indicating that decomposition of mulching material contributes
   to maintain P nutrition. In conclusion, mulching can be recommended as
   it contributes to maintaining P fractions bioavailable while at the same
   time promoting P limiting conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Contrasting effects of grassland management modes on species-abundance
   distributions of multiple groups}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{237}},
Pages = {{143-153}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Intensive land use is a major cause of biodiversity loss, but most
   studies comparing the response of multiple taxa rely on simple diversity
   measures while analyses of other community attributes are only recently
   gaining attention. Species-abundance distributions (SADs) are a
   community attribute that can be used to study changes in the overall
   abundance structure of species groups, and whether these changes are
   driven by abundant or rare species.
   We evaluated the effect of grassland management intensity for three
   land-use modes (fertilization, mowing, grazing) and their combination on
   species richness and SADs for three belowground (arbuscular mycorrhizal
   fungi, prokaryotes and insect larvae) and seven aboveground groups
   (vascular plants, bryophytes and lichens; arthropod herbivores;
   arthropod pollinators; bats and birds). Three descriptors of SADs were
   evaluated: general shape (abundance decay rate), proportion of rare
   species (rarity) and proportional abundance of the commonest species
   (dominance).
   Across groups, taxonomic richness was largely unaffected by land-use
   intensity and only decreased with increasing mowing intensity. Of the
   three SAD descriptors, abundance decay rate became steeper with
   increasing combined land-use intensity across groups. This reflected a
   decrease in rarity among plants, herbivores and vertebrates. Effects of
   fertilization on the three descriptors were similar to the combined
   land-use intensity effects. Mowing intensity only affected the SAD
   descriptors of insect larvae and vertebrates, while grazing intensity
   produced a range of effects on different descriptors in distinct groups.
   Overall, belowground groups had more even abundance distribtitions than
   aboveground groups. Strong differences among aboveground groups and
   between above- and belowground groups indicate that no single taxonomic
   group can serve as an indicator for effects in other groups.
   In the past, the use of SADs has been hampered by concerns over
   theoretical models underlying specific forms of SADs. Our study shows
   that SAD descriptors that are not connected to a particular model are
   suitable to assess the effect of land use on community structure. (C)

Title = {{Effects of grazing intensity and the use of veterinary medical products
   on dung beetle biodiversity in the sub-mountainous landscape of Central
   Italy}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JAN 12}},
Abstract = {{Grazing extensification and intensification are among the main problems
   affecting European grasslands. We analyze the impact of grazing
   intensity (low and moderate) and the use of veterinary medical products
   (VMPs) on the dung beetle community in the province of Pesaro-Urbino
   (Italy). Grazing intensity is a key factor in explaining the diversity
   of dung beetles. In the case of the alpha diversity component, sites
   with a low level of grazing activity-related in a previous step to the
   subsequent abandonment of traditional farming-is characterized by a loss
   of species richness (q = 0) and a reduction in alpha diversity at the
   levels q = 1 and q = 2. In the case of beta diversity, sites with a
   different grazing intensity show remarkable differences in terms of the
   composition of their species assemblages. The use of VMPs is another
   important factor in explaining changes in dung beetle diversity. In
   sites with a traditional use of VMPs, a significant loss of species
   richness and biomass is observed, as is a notable effect on beta
   diversity. In addition, the absence of indicator species in sites with a
   historical use of VMPs corroborates the hypothesis that these substances
   have a ubiquitous effect on dung beetles. However, the interaction
   between grazing activity and VMPs when it comes to explaining changes in
   dung beetle diversity is less significant (or is not significant) than
   the main effects (each factor separately) for alpha diversity, biomass
   and species composition. This may be explained if we consider that both
   factors affect the various species differently. In other words, the
   reduction in dung availability affects several larger species more than
   it does very small species, although this does not imply that the former
   are more susceptible to injury caused by the ingestion of dung
   contaminated with VMPs. Finally, in order to prevent negative
   consequences for dung beetle diversity, we propose the maintenance of a
   moderate grazing intensity and the rational use of VMPs. It is our view
   that organic management can prevent excessive extensification while
   providing an economic stimulus to the sector. Simultaneously, it can
   also prevent the abuse of VMPs.}},

Year = {{2017}},

Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 3}},
Abstract = {{Plant species diversity may benefit natural grassland productivity, but
   its effect in managed grassland systems is not well understood. A
   four-year multispecies grassland experiment was conducted to investigate
   the effect of species diversity-legumes and non-leguminous forbs-on
   productivity, persistence and sward quality under cutting or grazing
   regimes and with or without slurry application. Three mixtures were
   established -3-mix: grass, red and white clover, 10-mix: 3-mix plus
   birdsfoot trefoil and six non-leguminous forbs, and 12-mix: 10-mix plus
   lucerne and festulolium. Species diversity increased sward production
   and yield persistence under cutting regime. The 12-mix had the highest
   yield from the second year onwards and no statistically significant
   yield reduction over four years, while annual yields in the 3-mix and
   10-mix decreased significantly with increasing grassland age. The higher
   yield in the 12-mix was mainly due to the inclusion of high-yielding
   lucerne. The 10-mix and 12-mix had lower proportions of unsown species
   than the 3-mix, the difference being dependent on grassland age.
   Generally, the 3-mix had higher concentrations of in-vitro organic
   matter digestibility (IVOMD), neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and crude
   protein (CP), and a lower concentration of ash than the 10-mix and
   12-mix. Slurry application increased annual yield production by 10\% and
   changed the botanical composition, increasing the proportion of grass
   and decreasing the proportion of legumes. Compared to cutting, grazing
   increased forage production by 9\% per cut on average and lowered legume
   and forb proportions in the mixtures, but yields did not differ among
   the three mixtures. Overall, our results suggest that species diversity
   increases sward productivity and persistence only under an ungrazed
   cutting regime. We conclude that increasing species diversity by
   selecting appropriate species with compatible management is key to
   achieving both high yields and high persistence in managed grasslands.}},

   forb growth habit was favoured over a cauline erect habit under HDG. At
   Cedarville, few grass or forb species showed differences between HDG and
   LDG, possibly because of an overriding influence of the absence of
   burning in both grazing systems. These results suggest that HDG
   potentially has negative impacts on soil health and vegetation
   composition of South African mesic grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock production is an appropriate land use for mainstreaming
   biodiversity conservation, but little is known about the impact of
   grazing strategies on forbs that contribute most species, in grasslands.
   This study compared the effects of high-density, short-duration stocking
   (HDG) with no grazing (control) on vegetation structure, composition and
   demography of selected perennial forbs in a South African mesic
   grassland in a three-year experiment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. HDG
   resulted in four-fold more and deeper litter accumulation, which reduced
   irradiance. Cover of three forb species, including the alien Bidens
   pilosa, was promoted and cover of another three forb species was reduced
   under HDG. There were no short-term effects of HDG on diversity,
   evenness and species richness. Ninety percent of forb species were
   damaged by HDG; type of damage varied widely from leaves and stems
   grazed to tearing and shredding by the hooves of cattle. Study of
   demography revealed that HDG threatened future populations of the
   grazing-sensitive species Afroaster hispida, Agathisanthemum
   chlorophyllum and Gerbera ambigua through increased mortality or
   reduction in the recruitment of large from small individuals. This study
   has revealed that HDG potentially has negative direct and indirect
   effects on indigenous perennial forbs in a South African mesic
   grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Mowing measures are frequently used as a tool for species conservation.
   However, mowing intensity as well as ecological characteristics of
   different sites may have an influence on the respective species or
   assemblages. Based on a BACI study design we tested if the effect of
   mowing on carabid assemblages is more pronounced with a higher intensity
   of the mowing measures, and if the results are influenced by differences
   in environmental characteristics between individual study sites. Based
   on 2650 carabid individuals belonging to 43 species we demonstrated that
   an intensification of mowing intensity resulted in an increased effect
   on the carabid coenoses. While assemblages from study sites mown once in
   the year were located closer to those from unmown sites, assemblages
   from study sites mown twice in the year were clearly separated in
   ordination analysis. However, some environmental variables, as shown by
   plant indicator values, accounted for a comparatively high amount of the
   variance. The study confirms that in the context of using mowing as a
   measure for nature conservation the mowing intensity has to be taken
   into account, but also variation in environmental factors.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},

Pages = {{50-61}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Questions: Does the absence of equalizing mechanisms after cessation of
   grazing unleash strong above-ground competitors to create large patches
   in the community? Do these competitive intraspecific aggregations
   displace and exclude other species, thereby reducing species diversity?
   Location: Atlantic grasslands, Aralar Natural Park, Basque Country,
   Northern Iberian Peninsula.
   Methods: Large herbivores were experimentally excluded from three sites
   (50 m x 50 m exclusion fences) during 9 yr in a productive semi-natural
   grassland system with a long history of grazing, using adjacent grazed
   plots as experimental controls. Sampling was carried out by
   systematically placing 100 quadrats (0.5 m x 0.5 m) in each of the six
   plots. Floristic composition and abundance, as well as eight
   hydrological and chemical soil properties, were measured in each
   quadrat. The spatial structures created by competitive species were
   analysed using RDA in conjunction with Moran's eigenvector maps, and
   soil variables were simultaneously included in the analyses, thus
   disentangling the structures likely created by niche effects.
   Competitive exclusion was further determined using linear regressions
   between species richness and abundance of competitive species.
   Results: Grazing exclusion unleashed competitive species such as Festuca
   microphylla and Agrostis capillaris, which became dominant in the
   exclusion plots and created large spatial patches. Furthermore, a
   negative linear relationship, consistent across exclusion plots, was
   observed between species richness and abundance of competitive species,
   indicating that strong above-ground competitors outcompeted other
   species when herbivores were excluded. However, the outcome of grazing
   exclusion across sites depended to some extent on local environmental
   conditions (niche effects).
   Conclusions: This work confirms that the powerful equalizing mechanism
   of disturbance by herbivores is crucial for species co-existence in
   productive grasslands. However, important differences observed in
   environmental effects across sites suggest that, even in highly
   productive grasslands, plant traits and local environmental
   characteristics (niche effects) do matter for species co-existence.}},

Abstract = {{Flowering in many orchids is determined by the resource status of
   plants, which in turn is influenced by habitat management. Most European
   orchids require high light intensities for photosynthesis, failing to
   flower and fruit at low light levels. Agricultural practices, especially
   fertilisation and mowing/grazing regime, can therefore influence the
   fitness and reproductive success of orchids. The studied species, autumn
   lady's-tresses (Spiranthes spiralis), is a small, long-lived and
   late-flowering perennial orchid and one of the most sensitive to low
   light availability. The general species' fitness, measured as a set of
   robust morphological traits in relation to vegetation height, which
   directly reflect the time of the last seasonal mowing and so the light
   availability, was the main scope of this research. A total of 2442
   flowering exemplars (of which 427 were morphologically evaluated) were
   recorded on 26 grassland patches applying the systematic scanning of the
   potential growing sites in the Goricko Natural Park (NE Slovenia). We
   revealed that earlier mowing negatively affects the density of flowering
   individuals and plant fitness in general. The number of the rosette
   leaves was found to be the most important trait that could be used as a
   proxy for the general plant fitness of this orchid species because the
   significant positive correlation with the measured morphological traits
   was confirmed. The number of the rosette leaves shows a significant
   negative relation to vegetation height. Late seasonal mowing, which has
   a significant positive impact on the plant fitness, enhances Spiranthes
   spiralis population viability and density.}},

Abstract = {{Wild herbivores and livestock share the majority of rangelands
   worldwide, yet few controlled experiments have addressed their
   individual, additive, and interactive impacts on ecosystem function.
   While ungulate herbivores generally reduce standing biomass, their
   effects on aboveground net primary production (ANPP) can vary by spatial
   and temporal context, intensity of herbivory, and herbivore identity and
   species richness. Some evidence indicates that moderate levels of
   herbivory can stimulate aboveground productivity, but few studies have
   explicitly tested the relationships among herbivore identity, grazing
   intensity, and ANPP. We used a long-term exclosure experiment to examine
   the effects of three groups of wild and domestic ungulate herbivores
   (megaherbivores, mesoherbivore wildlife, and cattle) on herbaceous
   productivity in an African savanna. Using both field measurements
   (productivity cages) and satellite imagery, we measured the effects of
   different herbivore guilds, separately and in different combinations, on
   herbaceous productivity across both space and time. Results from both
   productivity cage measurements and satellite normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) demonstrated a positive relationship between
   mean productivity and total ungulate herbivore pressure, driven in
   particular by the presence of cattle. In contrast, we found that
   variation in herbaceous productivity across space and time was driven by
   the presence of wild herbivores (primarily mesoherbivore wildlife),
   which significantly reduced heterogeneity in ANPP and NDVI across both
   space and time. Our results indicate that replacing wildlife with cattle
   (at moderate densities) could lead to similarly productive but more
   heterogeneous herbaceous plant communities in rangelands.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores alter plant communities directly
   by selectively consuming plant species; and indirectly by inducing
   morphological and physiological changes to plant traits that provide
   competitive or survivorship advantages to some life forms over others.
   Progressively excluding aboveground herbivore communities (ungulates,
   medium and small sized mammals, invertebrates) over five growing
   seasons, we explored how leaf morphology (specific leaf area or SLA) and
   nutrition (nitrogen, carbon, phosphorous, potassium, sodium, and
   calcium) of different plant life forms (forbs, legumes, grasses, sedges)
   correlated with their dominance. We experimented in two subalpine
   grassland types with different land-use histories: (1) heavily grazed,
   nutrient-rich, short-grass vegetation and (2) lightly grazed, lower
   nutrient tall-grass vegetation. We found differences in leaf traits
   between treatments where either all herbivores were excluded or all
   herbivores were present, showing the importance of considering the
   impacts of both vertebrates and invertebrates on the leaf traits of
   plant species. Life forms responses to the progressive exclusion of
   herbivores were captured by six possible combinations: (1) increased
   leaf size and resource use efficiency (leaf area/nutrients) where lower
   nutrient levels are invested in leaf construction, but a reduction in
   the number of leaves, for example, forbs in both vegetation types, (2)
   increased leaf size and resource use efficiency, for example, legumes in
   short grass, (3) increased leaf size but a reduction in the number of
   leaves, for example, legumes in the tall grass, (4) increased number of
   leaves produced and increased resource use efficiency, for example,
   grasses in the short grass, (5) increased resource use efficiency of
   leaves only, for example, grasses and sedges in the tall grass, and (6)
   no response in terms of leaf construction or dominance, for example,
   sedges in the short grass. Although we found multiple possible responses
   by life forms to progressive exclusion of herbivores, we also found some
   important generalities. Changes in leaf traits of legumes and grasses
   correlated with their increasing dominance in the short-grass vegetation
   and plants were more efficient at constructing photosynthetic tissue
   when herbivores are present with few exceptions. These results
   demonstrate that vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores are essential to
   maintain plant species richness and resource-use efficiency.}},

Title = {{Effects of grazing on ecosystem structure and function of alpine
   grasslands in Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau: a synthesis}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Humans have grazed on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) for many
   thousands of years. In recent decades, the intensity of grazing has
   increased and several new management strategies have been put into place
   to address the resulting changes in rangeland condition. Effective
   management of grazing activities in this region requires understanding
   the impact of livestock grazing across the diverse array of alpine
   grassland ecosystems present in the QTP, but recent studies have
   identified a number of critical uncertainties in the ecological science
   that underlies these management principles. To address these
   uncertainties, we carried out a synthesis analysis of the effect of
   livestock grazing on 26 indicators of ecosystem structure and function
   based on 61 studies from 88 independent research sites within the QTP.
   Our synthesis results indicate that livestock grazing exerts complex
   controls on ecosystem structure and function, which vary according to
   local landscape characteristics. We found that grazing contributes to
   greater plant species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson dominance
   index, and Pielou evenness index significantly increased 0.18, 0.05, and
   0.03, respectively, due to grazing), but decreased aboveground biomass
   (47.15\%), soil organic carbon (12.41\%), soil total nitrogen (12.75\%),
   and microbial biomass carbon (9.42\%). Further, ecosystem function is
   controlled by interactions between grazing and other landscape
   characteristics such as elevation and mean annual temperature. The
   management regime currently in place in the QTP, which involves complete
   exclusion of grazing in some areas, can have variable effects on
   grassland health. Therefore, the complexity of these responses is an
   indication that livestock and grassland management may benefit from a
   more nuanced management regime than is currently utilized in the QTP.}},

Title = {{How does roadside vegetation management affect the diversity of vascular
   plants and invertebrates? A systematic review protocol}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Roadsides have been acknowledged as potential substitutes
   for semi-natural grasslands and other open habitats with high
   biodiversity, many of which are now declining. Current recommendations
   for roadside management to promote conservation of biodiversity are
   largely based on studies of plants in meadows or pastures, although such
   areas often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental conditions
   and disturbance regimes. Stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need
   for more targeted guidelines for roadside management, based on actual
   roadside studies. We recently performed a systematic mapping of the
   evidence on how roadside management affects biodiversity and the
   dispersal of species. Through this process, we found 98 studies on how
   the richness or abundance of species on roadsides is affected by
   management such as regular mowing, burning, grazing or selective
   mechanical removal of plants. Since all of these interventions entail
   removal of plant biomass, they are comparable. Most of the studies
   recorded management effects on vascular plants, but there were 14
   investigations of insects and other invertebrates. We now intend to
   proceed with a full systematic review of how maintenance or restoration
   of roadsides based on non-chemical vegetation removal affects the
   diversity of vascular plants and invertebrates.
   Methods: Most of the evidence on which the proposed systematic review is
   to be based will be selected from the systematic map. To identify more
   recently published literature on the topic of the review, we will
   perform a search update using a subset of the search terms applied for
   the systematic map. The criteria for inclusion of studies will be the
   same as for the map, except that interventions and outcomes will be
   restricted to those relevant to the review. Relevant studies will be
   subject to critical appraisal and categorised as having high or low
   validity for the review. Studies with low validity will be excluded from
   the review. Utilisable data on outcomes, interventions and other
   potential effect modifiers will be extracted from included articles. A
   narrative synthesis will describe the validity and findings of all
   studies in the review. Where a sufficient number of studies report
   similar outcome types, meta-analysis will be conducted.}},

Abstract = {{This study had the aim of investigating the utility of image-based point
   cloud data for estimation of vertical canopy cover (VCC). An accurate
   measure of VCC based on photogrammetric matching of aerial images would
   aid in vegetation mapping, especially in areas where aerial imagery is
   acquired regularly. The test area is located in southern Sweden and was
   divided into four vegetation types with sparse to dense tree cover:
   unmanaged coniferous forest; pasture areas with deciduous tree cover;
   wetland; and managed coniferous forest. Aerial imagery with a ground
   sample distance of 0.24 m was photogrammetrically matched to produce
   dense image-based point cloud data. Two different image matching
   software solutions were used and compared: MATCH-T DSM by Trimble and
   SURE by nFrames. The image-based point clouds were normalized using a
   digital terrain model derived from airborne laser scanner (ALS) data.
   The canopy cover metric vegetation ratio was derived from the
   image-based point clouds, as well as from raster-based canopy height
   models (CHMs) derived from the point clouds. Regression analysis was
   applied with vegetation ratio derived from near nadir ALS data as the
   dependent variable and metrics derived from image-based point cloud data
   as the independent variables. Among the different vegetation types,
   vegetation ratio derived from the image-based point cloud data generated
   by using MATCH-T resulted in relative root mean square errors (rRMSE) of
   VCC ranging from 6.1\% to 29.3\%. Vegetation ratio based on point clouds
   from SURE resulted in rRMSEs ranging from 7.3\% to 37.9\%. Use of the
   vegetation ratio based on CHMs generated from the image-based point
   clouds resulted in similar, yet slightly higher values of rRMSE.}},

Title = {{Conservation and pastoral value of former arable lands in the
   agro-pastoral system of the Alta Murgia National Park (Southern Italy)}},
Journal = {{ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{124-132}},
Abstract = {{Grasslands are an important element of European landscapes and
   environment. In the last decades, several causes have contributed to
   their decline, among which the intensification of agriculture
   activities. The National Park of Alta Murgia represents a typical
   agro-pastoral karst system where the conversion to arable lands caused a
   drastic decline of semi-natural rocky grasslands of high naturalistic
   value that traditionally were used for sheep grazing. This change of
   land use created much concern about the lack of biodiversity and soil
   degradation. Thus, the Park Authority promotes reconversions of arable
   lands into grasslands to safeguard biodiversity, increase pastoralism
   and enhance the multi-functionality of farms. This study evaluates the
   conservation and pastoral value of plant communities in former arable
   lands derived from grasslands conversion (by crushing the rocky
   substrate) and subsequently abandoned. We selected seven sites of these
   abandoned arable lands, no longer ploughed or sown for three to five or
   twelve to fifteen years. In order to have a comparison with situations
   of low anthropic pressures, other five sites were selected in nearby
   natural rocky grasslands, without evidence of soil disturbance. Further
   two sites were selected in lands manually cleared from stones and taken
   out of crop production for more than fifty years. Vegetation samples
   were carried out according to the standard phytosociological method.
   Shannon and Richness indexes, ecological and phytogeographical quality
   and pastoral value were calculated. The ecological quality was
   calculated through the ratio between cover of diagnostic taxa of the
   higher syntaxonomic units characterising the undisturbed pastures and
   total cover. The phytogeographical value was evaluated considering the
   cover of endemic, sub-endemic and rare taxa out of the total cover value
   of each plant sample. For the calculation of pastoral value we
   considered the palatability of taxa on a scale ranging from 0 to 5
   according to data found in scientific literature. From a conservation
   perspective, sites originated from the conversion of rocky pastures by
   crushing of the rocky surface showed marked differences from undisturbed
   grasslands, even after 15 years from abandonment. Lands manually cleared
   and abandoned for more than fifty years did not show appreciable
   differences from semi-natural grasslands, conserving many taxa of high
   conservation value. On the other hand, fields originated from grasslands
   conversion showed higher pastoral value. This paper emphasises the need
   for safeguarding the rocky substrates and their remnant typical
   grassland communities, even in the so-called quote. Results are useful
   for the sustainable management of the agro-pastoral system of Alta
   Murgia, taking into account the ecological and economic role of those
   lands whose rocky substrate had been crushed.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsIs the incidence of root hemiparasitic plants in non-forest
   vegetation associated with high diversity? Are root hemiparasites more
   associated with species-rich vegetation than other species?
   LocationCzech Republic.
   MethodsPlot size-corrected species richness, Shannon diversity and
   Pielou's evenness were computed for a representative set of 18 101
   vegetation plots representing all main types of terrestrial open
   (non-forest) habitats of the country. Null models of species richness
   assuming occurrence of a random species with given occurrence frequency,
   reflecting higher incidence probability in species-rich plots, were
   constructed for 16 common root hemiparasitic species. The null model
   distribution of species richness was subsequently compared with the
   actual mean species richness of plots containing the respective root
   hemiparasites. Median values of plot Shannon diversity and evenness were
   computed for each species in the database. Values obtained for plots
   containing individual root hemiparasites were compared with distribution
   of values for other species in the database.
   ResultsThe occurrence of 11 of 16 root hemiparasites studied was
   associated with high species richness significantly more than under
   random expectations; three species were negatively associated. Three
   root hemiparasites were among the top 5\% of all species associated with
   high species richness and Shannon diversity, and eight were among the
   top 25\%. Almost 50\% of the top 1\% most species-rich plots contained
   at least one root hemiparasitic species.
   ConclusionsWe demonstrated a positive association between the incidence
   of most root hemiparasites and diversity of non-forest terrestrial plant
   communities at a broad landscape scale. This finding scales up the
   results of experimental studies that showed some root hemiparasites act
   as ecosystem engineers, increasing vegetation diversity. Root
   hemiparasites should be regarded as important biodiversity indicators
   and potential drivers of biodiversity. As such, conserving their wild
   populations or promoting their establishment should become a goal of
   nature conservation and ecological restoration.}},

Title = {{Holocene mammal extinctions in the Carpathian Basin: a review}},

Abstract = {{1. Mammals are a key target group for conservation biology. Insights
   into the patterns and timing of and driving forces behind their past
   extinctions help us to understand their present, and to predict and
   mitigate their future biodiversity loss. Much research has been focused
   on the intensely debated megafaunal extinctions at the
   Pleistocene-Holocene transition, whereas the Holocene mammal extinctions
   have remained less studied.
   2. Here, we consider the Holocene extinctions of mammal taxa in the
   Carpathian Basin, a distinctive and biogeographically well-constrained
   predominantly lowland region in Central Europe. For the first time, we
   combine data from palaeontological, archaeozoological, and historical
   sources for a comprehensive analysis.
   3. A total of 11 mammal species, including steppe-dwelling rodents,
   large carnivores and herbivores, disappeared from the Carpathian Basin
   during the Holocene. The extinctions are interpreted in the framework of
   changing habitats and ecosystems, as grasslands and open forests
   vanished at the westernmost limits of the Eurasian steppe.
   4. The temporal distribution of extinctions is non-random; most taxon
   range terminations are concentrated around two discrete events. Members
   of the steppe community disappeared between 5000 and 4000 BP, around the
   Copper Age-Bronze Age transition. Large herbivores that found refugia in
   the forests vanished later, between the 16th and 18th centuries AD. The
   steppe, forest-steppe ecosystems of the Carpathian Basin suffered a
   considerable loss in their mammalian fauna, which has significant
   implications for conservation efforts for the existing similar dry, open
   habitats in western Eurasia.
   5. Further research and better age constraints are needed to establish
   the causes of extinctions more firmly, but the lack of synchronous and
   severe climate and vegetation changes and the coincidence with
   transformations in human history suggest the prime role of anthropogenic
   disturbance. We conclude that there were two waves of Holocene mammal
   extinctions of megafaunal character in the Carpathian Basin.}},

Abstract = {{Shrub encroachment and declining grass production are widespread
   throughout the grasslands and savannas of the Mexico-US borderlands,
   with negative consequences for ecosystem services, livestock production,
   and native biodiversity. The problem suggests a complex interaction of
   social and ecological drivers that are not well understood. Using the
   Chihuahuan Desert grasslands of the Janos Biosphere Reserve of northern
   Mexico as a case study, we sought to understand the social-ecological
   context that shaped landscape change. Our approach included a synthesis
   of the historical literature and interviews with local residents, with
   the goal of facilitating long-term grassland restoration. Findings
   indicate that recent changes in Chihuahuan Desert grasslands are likely
   related to the co-occurrence of heavy grazing, fire suppression, and the
   elimination of key species, including prairie dogs and native ungulates.
   Local residents widely perceive both fire and prairie dogs to be
   destructive to grasslands and livelihoods. Over the last 50 years,
   evolving land tenure policies have fragmented the landscape into smaller
   parcels which typically produce an insufficient livelihood from cattle
   despite high stocking rates. Declining cattle profitability has
   motivated the sale and conversion of rangelands to more profitable
   croplands irrigated with groundwater. Since the founding of the Janos
   Biosphere Reserve in 2009, universities, local cattle operators,
   conservation organizations, and federal agencies have begun
   collaborating on restoration activities. While complete restoration of
   grasslands is unlikely, progress appears possible largely because of the
   willingness of local residents to try new management practices that may
   improve their ability to benefit from the land.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands, especially those under ecological management (i.e. mowing,
   and grazing without fertilizers and chemicals), have significant
   importance for many arthropods, including ground beetles. We studied the
   abundance and species diversity of Carabidae of four uphill grasslands
   (West Sudety Mountains, Poland) under different management intensity:
   cattle grazing (one or four times per year), mowing, and alternatively
   managed (grazing/mowing). Beetles were collected using pitfall traps
   during three whole grazing seasons, i.e. from April to October in
   2007-2009. The most frequent species of beetles, on each of the plots,
   were predators Poecilus cupreus, Calathus fuscipes and Nebria
   brevicollis. Sixtyfour ground beetle species were found altogether.
   Species richness ranged from 42 to 47, with the mean number of
   individuals per trap day(-1) from 0.006 to 0.018. In the years of the
   study the number of ground beetles and their species diversity were
   higher on meadows mown once per year and alternatively managed
   grasslands as compared with grazed sites. Therefore, the simplified,
   organic way of agricultural production with reduced mowing or moving
   combined with grazing can be considered as appropriate in preserving the
   biodiversity of the grasslands in mountainous regions.}},

Title = {{Exploring relationships between native vertebrate biodiversity and
   grazing land condition}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-37}},
Abstract = {{Although commercial grazing can degrade natural habitats, sustainably
   grazed land may be effective for wildlife conservation. Thus, land
   condition frameworks that assess the landscape quality of grazed land
   may also be useful for assessment of habitat quality for wildlife.
   However, the relationship between the condition of grazed land and
   native biodiversity is mostly unknown, and this knowledge gap must be
   addressed to adequately balance commercial production and conservation.
   In the present case study we determined the relevance of a widely used
   grazing land condition scale to understanding native vertebrate species
   richness and abundance (birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals and all
   these vertebrate classes grouped) in grazed rangelands in northern
   Australia (similar to 24-13 degrees S; annual rainfall ranging from >
   1200 to < 400 mm), sampled over approximately 10 years from 17 unique
   sites, containing 381 1-ha study plots. We defined the land condition
   scale relative to climate and comprehensive assessment of habitat
   attributes, and then described the relationships between land condition,
   habitat and biodiversity. The land condition scale partially explained
   richness and abundance patterns only for mammals (especially rodents),
   which tended to be higher in better-condition pasture. For other
   vertebrate groups, the scale was a very poor descriptor of richness and
   abundance. The land condition scale was not useful to assess wildlife
   diversity primarily because `woody thickening' (increases in woody
   vegetation on grazed land, including shrubs and trees) lowers the
   `grazing value' of land while also generally promoting vertebrate
   diversity. In line with this, biodiversity decreased with increasing
   bare ground and erosion, together with, and in the absence of,
   vegetation cover (i.e. desertification), consistent with grazing land
   degradation. The present study supports observations that land clearing
   and reductions in woody vegetation on grazed rangelands are particularly
   detrimental to native vertebrates.}},

Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{37}},
Pages = {{271-288}},
Abstract = {{Wet grasslands once covered a large area in the lowlands of northern
   Germany, but have declined since several decades as a result of land use
   intensification. Permanent plot data from such grasslands in the region
   that would allow to assess the extent of changes in species composition
   and richness are still rare. Here, we present a re-visitation study of
   52 quasi-permanent plots from the Stedinger Land area in the basin of
   the river Weser near Bremen, comparing quadrat data between 1948 and
   2015. In 1948, the grasslands were characterized by species typical of
   wet, moderately fertile grasslands belonging to the Bromo-Senecionetum
   aquatici (Bromion racemosi), including 15 species currently classified
   as threatened. Until 2015, the vegetation had changed strongly: almost
   all indicators of wet grasslands had either declined or completely
   vanished, whereas more nutrient-demanding species of less wet soils had
   increased, especially grasses. The cumulative number of species had
   declined by 50\%, while mean plot species richness had decreased by
   64.6\%, mainly resulting from the pronounced loss of many herbs. A
   comparison of mean Ellenberg indicator values suggested that the plots
   had become drier, but also more base- and nutrient-rich, most likely
   triggered by the intensification of land use with drainage and
   fertilization as well as more frequent and earlier cutting. Our study
   reflects the dramatic loss of plant species diversity in wet grasslands
   over the past 60-70 years in areas not preserved and properly managed,
   and it documents the need for protecting remnants of these grasslands
   and for restoring wet grassland areas by re-wetting, nutrient removal
   and the transition to a less intensive land use.}},

Title = {{Grassland management in Germany: effects on plant diversity and
   vegetation composition}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{37}},
Pages = {{379-397}},
Abstract = {{The vast majority of European grasslands strongly depend on the regular
   removal of aboveground biomass by agricultural land use, mostly grazing
   or mowing or a combination of both. These specific management schemes
   have strong influence on plant diversity and vegetation composition,
   depending on their particular characteristics and their intensity. For
   example, the presence or absence of fertilization will favour some
   species over others, changing plant communities accordingly.
   Additionally, the farmer's choice of a specific management scheme will
   also depend on the abiotic site conditions. This leads to a complex set
   of associated factors potentially affecting the structure and diversity
   of grasslands.
   In this study, we compiled a unique dataset of 169 differently managed
   grasslands (in total 202 plots), which were sampled in five regions
   across Germany. For each plot, we documented management characteristics,
   measured plant diversity and functional group composition, recorded
   endangered species according to red lists, and calculated Ellenberg
   indicator values. We assessed patterns in vegetation composition and
   diversity in relation to the particular management scheme, which was
   categorized as meadow, meadow with autumn or winter grazing (with mowing
   as predominant management), mown pasture (where mowing and grazing are
   used at roughly equal intensity), seasonal pasture (with grazing as
   predominant management) and year-round pasture.
   Our study showed that grasslands of different management schemes
   significantly differed in diversity, structure and functional
   composition. However, it also became obvious that vegetation composition
   was not strictly distinguished by management alone. Local and regional
   characteristics such as soil conditions, size of the grassland species
   pool or land-use history, often played a more prominent role than land
   use alone. Assumingly, the interplay of those local and regional
   characteristics with the pro portion of grazing and mowing at a
   particular site inhibit clear differences among our predefined
   management schemes. Nevertheless, species richness was the lowest in
   year-round pastures, moderate in meadows and highest in seasonal
   pastures. In contrast, year-round pastures harboured the highest mean
   numbers of endangered species. The dependency of a certain management
   scheme on site-specific environmental factors such as soil fertility,
   further complicated the clear separation of management effects from
   those of the environmental background.
   In summary, modern grassland management strongly shaped grassland
   vegetation, but today's combination of different management practices
   complicated the assessment of specific land-use effects on plant
   diversity. Thus, neither mowing nor grazing turned out to be ``the one
   and only{''} management for nature conservation. Although our results
   challenge long-term prognoses for future vegetation development under
   modern grassland management, we clearly showed that low-intensity
   management and the absence of fertilization promoted plant diversity,
   with higher values in pastures compared to meadows and mown pastures.}},

Title = {{How are biodiversity and dispersal of species affected by the management
   of roadsides? A systematic map}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Background: In many parts of the world, roadsides are regularly managed
   for traffic-safety reasons. Hence, there are similarities between
   roadsides and certain other managed habitats, such as wooded pastures
   and mown or grazed grasslands. These habitats have declined rapidly in
   Europe during the last century. For many species historically associated
   with them, roadsides may function as new primary habitats or as
   dispersal corridors in fragmented landscapes. Current recommendations
   for roadside management to promote conservation values are largely based
   on studies of plants in semi-natural grasslands, although such areas
   often differ from roadsides in terms of environmental conditions and
   disturbance regimes. Moreover, roadsides provide habitat not only for
   plants but also for many insects. For these reasons, stakeholders in
   Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted management
   recommendations, based on actual studies of roadside biodiversity.
   Methods: This systematic map provides an overview of the available
   evidence on how biodiversity is affected by various forms of roadside
   management, and how such management influences the dispersal of species
   along roads or roadsides. We searched for literature using 13 online
   publication databases, 4 search engines, 36 specialist websites and 5
   literature reviews. Search terms were developed in English, Danish,
   Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish. Identified
   articles were screened for relevance using criteria set out in a
   protocol. No geographical restrictions were applied, and all species and
   groups of organisms were considered. Descriptions of included studies
   are available in an Excel file, and also in an interactive GIS
   application that can be accessed at an external website.
   Results: Our searches identified more than 7000 articles. The 207
   articles included after screening described 301 individual studies
   considered to be relevant. More than two-thirds of these studies were
   conducted in North America, with most of the rest performed in Europe.
   More than half of the studies were published in grey literature such as
   reports from agencies or consultants. The interventions most commonly
   studied were herbicide use, sowing and mowing, followed by soil
   amendments such as mulching and fertiliser additions. The outcomes most
   frequently reported were effects of interventions on the abundance or
   species richness of herbs/forbs, graminoids and woody plants. Effects on
   insects and birds were reported in 6 and 3\% of the studies,
   respectively.
   Conclusions: This systematic map is based on a comprehensive and
   systematic screening of all available literature on the effects of
   roadside management on biodiversity and dispersal of species. As such it
   should be of value to a range of actors, including managers and
   policymakers. The map provides a key to finding concrete guidance for
   conservation- and restoration-oriented roadside management from
   published research. However, the map also highlights important knowledge
   gaps: little data was found for some geographical regions, research is
   heavily biased taxonomically towards plants, and no study was found on
   how species dispersal was affected by roadside management. The map could
   therefore be a source of inspiration for new research.}},

Title = {{What evidence exists on the impact of agricultural practices in fruit
   orchards on biodiversity indicator species groups? A systematic map
   protocol}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biodiversity loss, due in part to intensification of
   agriculture, has become a global issue. In this context, fruit producers
   are looking for nature-friendly production methods. Their aim is to
   reduce intensive pesticide use and to enhance orchard management in
   terms of optimising habitats for beneficial organisms. However, fruit
   production, especially in low-stem orchards, requires several
   interventions over the course of the year (tillage, thinning, mowing,
   disking, spraying, fertilisation, etc.), each of them representing a
   disturbance. Surprisingly, international journals seem to contain few
   publications on the impact of most of these practices (except
   pesticides) on biodiversity in general and beneficial organisms in
   particular, even though the benefits of predators to control pests have
   been known for decades. However, an increasing number of studies have
   been published in the past 10 years, corroborating the importance that
   biodiversity has gained as a topic in life cycle assessment. In this
   context, an expert system that considers the impact of individual
   farming activities on a set of biodiversity indicators (flora of crops
   and grasslands, birds, mammals, amphibians, slugs and snails, spiders,
   carabids, butterflies, wild bees, and grasshoppers) is to be extended to
   practices in low-stem and high-stem orchards. We therefore intend to
   conduct a systematic map to assess what evidence exists on the impact of
   agricultural practices in fruit orchards on biodiversity indicator
   species groups.
   Methods and output: By gathering this information, we aim (a) to assess
   the state of research on discrete indicators and/or practices, (b) to
   identify literature relevant for assessing production impact and habitat
   suitability and (c) to provide a wide-ranging overview of existing
   evidence and its transfer to extension services and public perception. A
   literature search in scientific journals, agronomy magazines and the
   internet will therefore be performed in English, German and French.
   Following article screening, included articles will be recorded and
   coded (per the results of a limited study quality assessment). The
   resulting database and maps will be presented along with descriptive
   statistics of the distribution and abundance of evidence across
   interventions and outcomes.}},

Journal = {{ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY \& EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{23-33}},
Abstract = {{Compassionate conservation is an emerging field in conservation that
   seeks to integrate animal protection and conservation to achieve either
   improved conservation outcomes, particularly where conservation
   priorities and human-wildlife conflict, or the same outcomes, but with
   less pain and suffering for wildlife. In the Australian Capital
   Territory (ACT), Eastern Grey Kangaroos (EGKs) are culled to reduce
   grazing pressure on threatened native grasslands and woodlands. We
   integrate decision-making criteria about animal protection into planning
   of wildlife-management to formulate a compassionate conservation
   management case study. The management criteria include a series of
   guiding questions: Is management necessary? Will intervention
   (management of EGKs) achieve the desired conservation outcomes? And, if
   intervention is necessary, is killing necessary? We found that kangaroos
   can be managed without culling. The conflict between conservation goals
   and kangaroo abundance is likely to be accentuated during extended
   drought. In the short-term, methods for improving rates of habitat
   recovery can include fencing of threatened grassland communities and
   reduction of kangaroo density via translocation. Human activity must
   also be monitored as multiple human-caused biotic and abiotic
   disturbances are known to have a strong impact on biodiversity of the
   native grassland habitats. In the medium to long-term, Eastern Grey
   Kangaroos have the potential for maintaining stable populations, and
   their herbivory is necessary for grassland function and nutrient
   cycling. Finally, we suggest that compassionate conservation and
   adaptive management can work well together as social values shift
   towards greater emphasis on animal protection.}},

Abstract = {{A meadow, a flowery meadow, a clearing, a lawn - smoothly trimmed, flat
   and recessed, a grassy pathway - these are elements of gardens that have
   been known for centuries, used in different styles and different types
   of gardens, including in public spaces. Pratum commune, commons or
   grassy mounds are the landmarks of the landscape of many a city, both
   currently and throughout history. Decorative grasses, such as pampas,
   Miscanthus or Pennisestum started to be used in garden compositions in
   XIX-century England. Initially more so due to their peculiarity than
   beauty. However, it was naturalism that gave rise to the wider use of
   grasses in gardens and parks in various places of the world and gained
   many propagators, including W. Robinson, J. Jensen K. Foerster and P.
   Oudolf.
   Grasses are currently often designed by landscape architects in
   urbanised spaces. They are employed both in geometric and freeform
   compositions. Their texture and delicate colour create a background for
   more expressive plants. They often constitute the key element of
   naturalist layouts, and the use of domestic species aids in preserving
   biodiversity and recreating the domestic landscape. Many of these
   current projects have been discussed in magazines and subject literature
   and have received awards in competitions. This review article is devoted

   the level of participation in the low-intensity meadows' and

   influence on the degree of full-cost coverage; rather, it is other
   factors such as the size or altitude of a farm that are crucial.
   Participation in these programmes leads neither to the creation of a
   distinct and high economic rent (compensation without a quid pro quo),

Abstract = {{Background: Burial mounds (kurgans) of Eurasian steppes are man-made
   habitat islands that have the potential to harbour rich plant diversity
   due to micro-habitats associated with their topography.Aims: We assessed
   whether kurgan micro-habitats harboured different species pools and
   functional groups from those found on the surrounding steppes. In
   addition, we asked if these mounds were affected by different grazing
   intensities from those on the surrounding vegetation.Methods: We
   surveyed kurgan micro-habitats (northern and southern slopes,
   surrounding ditch) and adjacent steppe plains in non-grazed, moderately
   grazed and heavily grazed sites in northern Kazakhstan. We analysed
   differences in species composition of four habitats under three grazing
   regimes using Generalised Linear Mixed Models, PCA ordination and
   indicator species analysis.Results: Kurgan micro-habitats had diverse
   vegetation and supported the co-existence of plant species with
   different environmental needs. We identified 16 steppe specialists
   confined to kurgan micro-habitats. Steppe vegetation was well-adapted to
   extensive grazing, although heavy grazing supported ruderals and a
   decline in steppe specialists. There was a significant interaction
   between grazing intensity and habitat type: heavy grazing supported
   ruderals and suppressed steppe specialists especially on the
   slopes.Conclusions: We highlighted that kurgans play an important role
   as maintaining high plant diversity locally in extensive steppe plains
   in Central-Asia by increasing environmental heterogeneity and supporting
   specialist species confined to these micro-habitats.}},

Title = {{Performance of extensive cattle stocking on a reclaimed minerotrophic
   wet grassland}},
Journal = {{MIRES AND PEAT}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{19}},
Abstract = {{Extensive stocking with cattle is a common type of grassland management
   in reclaimed fen sites. However, due to the high productivity of
   grassland on organic soil with a history of intensive management,
   stocking at low rates may not allow an adequate balance of herbage
   production and utilisation. In the present study we examined the
   agronomic performance of an established (6-year) extensive cattle
   grazing system on a reclaimed fen grassland site in north-western
   Germany during the course of the grazing season. We regularly quantified
   the amount and energy content of herbage on offer based on compressed
   sward height (CSH), the spatial extent of patches of various degrees of
   grazing intensity (heavily or moderately grazed, non-grazed), and the
   chemical composition of the herbage, and assessed energy uptake and
   livestock performance in terms of live weight gain of the cattle. We
   deduced herbage utilisation from these data and quantified functional
   relationships between cattle grazing and the properties of the sward.
   Our data show that there was an inadequate balance between quantity and
   quality of forage on offer on the one hand, and demand and forage
   consumption by livestock on the other. As a result, live weight gains
   showed a seasonal pattern with a minimum in summer. The amount of energy
   on offer per animal unit had a significant effect on the sward
   structure, i.e. on both the area proportion of heavily grazed patches
   and the heterogeneity of CSH. These findings may be of interest in the
   context of conservation management of reclaimed fen grasslands, as they

Abstract = {{This paper describes the restoration of woody vegetation on my family's
   grazing property, `Eastlake' (1202 ha) on the Northern Tablelands of New
   South Wales. We commenced revegetating `Eastlake' in 1981 to reverse the
   loss of native tree cover due to New England dieback and improve shelter
   for livestock and pastures to increase farm profitability. We treated
   the revegetation program as a long-term business investment and, apart
   from a 5-year period of overseas employment, have allocated annual
   funding in the farm business plan ever since. Our decision was based on
   the benefits of shelter to livestock and pasture production. Once we
   began revegetation, aesthetics, amenity and the positive impact on the
   capital value of the farm became important motivations. More recently,
   increasing the farm's biodiversity and resilience, and conserving native
   flora and fauna, have also motivated us. Our strategy is to link upland
   areas of remnant timber with ridgeline corridors of planted vegetation
   to maximise shelter, minimise pasture production losses and provide
   dispersal corridors for fauna and wildlife habitat. Initially, we
   planted introduced species of tree and shrub, but now we revegetate
   mainly with native species, as well as fencing off remnant timber to
   encourage natural regeneration and direct seeding understorey species
   (mainly acacias) in degraded remnants and elsewhere. Our target is to
   increase the area of fenced-off and planted timber cover from 8\% to
   10\% over the next few years, which will take the proportion of total
   effective timber cover from similar to 8\% in 1980 to 18\% of the
   property. The key lessons are to: (1) plan, prepare, plant the right
   tree or shrub in the right place for the right purpose, and
   post-planting care (the `4 Ps'); (2) integrate revegetation into the
   whole-farm business plan; (3) finance the work slowly over time with the
   aid of a spatial farm plan; and (4) adapt to changing circumstances,
   values and understanding. Research is required to help farmers
   understand the role of on-farm biodiversity in contributing to the
   health of the farm business, owner-managers and their families and the
   farm environment, as well as to regional economies, communities,
   landscapes and society more generally.}},

Abstract = {{In rural Japan, various types of forest and grassland once used for
   agroforestry have now been abandoned because of socioeconomic changes
   associated with the decline in forestry, falling birth rate and aging
   population. The biodiversity of such secondary forests and grasslands,
   which had been maintained by routine management, is now in crisis. Among
   them, Kunugi (Quercus acutissima) forests in Kyushu island were
   exceptionally maintained by its management with clear-cut every 15-20
   years to produce bed logs for shiitake mushroom cultivation. Some of
   these Kunugi forests have been planted in abandoned cultivated fields
   and grasslands. To clarify the effect of clear-cutting on the
   conservation of herbaceous vegetation on the forest floor, the floor
   vegetation of Kunugi forests in Kumamoto Prefecture with various
   land-use histories was surveyed before and after clear-cutting.
   Detrended correspondence analysis showed that some plots that originated
   from grassland characterized by the dominance of Pleioblastus
   argenteostriatus before clear-cutting became dominated by Miscanthus
   sinensis after clear-cutting. After clear-cutting, species of grassland
   origin emerged and the biodiversity increased. The management of Kunugi
   forests has facilitated the survival of grassland species such as
   Solidago virgaurea subsp. asiatica, Eupatorium laciniatum, Adenophora
   triphylla var. japonica, Desmodium podocarpum subsp. podocarpum,
   Vincetoxicum amplexicaule and Sanguisorba officinalis. Therefore, the
   large-scale mosaic landscape of Kunugi patches of various ages within a
   15-20-year clear-cutting cycle may have contributed to the maintenance
   of regional biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal variation in composition and abundance of the
   macro-epifauna associated with seaweeds (Ulva lactuca, Cladophora sp.,
   Gracilariopsis longissima and Gracilaria bursa-pastoris) and seagrass
   (Cymodocea nodosa) was investigated at Menzel Jemil station in the
   Bizerte lagoon. Twelve replicate samples (25 x 25 cm frame) were
   collected monthly from October 2009 to September 2010. Sampling data
   yielded 21,575 invertebrate specimens from floating seaweeds and the
   seagrass, belonging to 40 taxa, of which 18 species were arthropods, 13
   molluscs, three echinoderms, three fishes, two polychaetes and one
   cnidarian. Crustaceans were the most dominant and the most speciesrich
   group and Idotea balthica basteri the most abundant species, accounting
   for 28.94\% of the total abundance. Minimum (9.25 +/- 5.56 species) and
   maximum (19.75 +/- 3.2 species) values of mean species richness were
   observed in December and June, respectively. Species richness and
   density of macro-epifauna showed similar trends to plant biomass and the
   highest values of both indices coincided with periods of maximal plant
   biomass. Mean values of Shannon's index H' and evenness J' were low,
   ranging from 0.34 +/- 0.02 bit to 1.08 +/- 0.06 bit, and from 0.23 +/-
   0.03 to 0.52 +/- 0.07, respectively. The high dominance of herbivores
   and detritivores highlighted the substantial role played by macrophytes
   as food source for associated macro-epifauna species. Multivariate
   analyses also indicated significant seasonal differences for the
   macro-epifauna assemblage and revealed significant relationships with
   environmental variables. According to the canonical correspondence
   analysis, concentrations of phosphates and nitrites, and temperature
   were the variables that explained the variation of the macro-epifauna

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands present opportunities for delivering multiple
   services but their conservation is tightly dependent on livestock
   farming. Wetlands and steppes represent two contrasting examples of
   semi-natural lands for which water in excess or deficit drives both
   natural habitats and livestock farming. Wetlands deliver environmental
   services such as support of biodiversity, particularly birds and flood
   protection. They constitute complex territories as many stakeholders
   interact to manage water levels. Among them, livestock farmers play a
   key role by managing those flooded grasslands. Wet grasslands are still
   endangered by both conversion to improved grasslands or crops and
   abandonment due to the difficulties associated with exploiting
   constrained lands. In south east France, transhumant sheep breeding
   allows to maintain open vegetation that decreases the risk of both fires
   in the Alpilles hills and avalanche in the Alp mountains. In La Crau,
   maintaining Sheep grazing appears to be the only way to ensure the
   durability of the ``Coussoul{''} habitat, the last steppe area in
   Europe. The crisis of sheep farming, return of wolves to the area and
   industrial development in La Crau all constitute a significant threat to
   this breeding system. The maintenance of breeding activities constitutes
   a challenge for the conservation of areas which have a high heritage
   value. Farming sectors face natural constraints which make management of
   the system more difficult and affect the economic viability, resulting
   in a need for an agroenvironmental policy. An increased market value of
   quality products, which are linked to production region, appears to be a
   lever to preserve livestock farming while conserving natural habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Resolution of plant diversity goals with the agricultural demands placed
   on grasslands may result in conflict between farmers and
   conservationists. To investigate options for reconciling these important
   issues implementable in the short-term within agro-environmental
   schemes, we analysed the impact of four years' management with grazing
   replaced by mowing on coordination of agricultural objectives, i.e.
   herbage yield, plant functional groups, nutrient contents and removal,
   forage value and plant diversity, i.e. species richness, Shannon-Wiener
   index, Ellenberg N indicator value. The study was carried out in three
   hillslope highland pasture sites (S1-S3) in the Sumava Mountains, Czech
   Republic, differing in soil properties and animal stocking rates, which
   were 0.92 in S1, 0.34 in S2, combined with mowing in some years and 0.73
   in S3 LU ha(-1). Some sections of each pasture site were twice yearly
   mowed. Our findings related to grazing combined or replaced with mowing
   were relevant to farmers' priorities acceptable for dairy cattle
   nutrition. Across sites, the herbage dry matter yield, herbage P, K and
   Mg contents and removal, proportion of graminoids and Ellenberg N values
   decreased with mowing, but forage value and herbage Ca removal remained
   identical under both managements. Species richness, Shannon-Wiener index
   and herbage Ca content increased with mowing via spread of forbs and/or
   legumes. However, to achieve a merit, short-term grazing exclusion with
   mowing has to take into account site-specific soil nutrient conditions.
   Very high soil P availability prevented from the increase in species
   richness with mowing (S3). Contrarily, in sites with lower soil P
   availability, but different availability of other nutrients (S1, S2),
   mowing fostered number and/or proportions of forbs and/or legumes.}},

Journal = {{PHYTOCOENOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{315-327}},
Abstract = {{Questions: To assess the feasibility of using visually-estimated
   vegetation cover in rapid assessment of herbivore food species abundance
   in the grass layer, we asked the following questions: 1) What is the
   relationship between total graminoid cover and biomass in forests, and
   does height improve the prediction of biomass from cover? 2) How does
   total cover relate to biomass in a grassland habitat? 3) How does
   elephant food species graminoid cover relate to individual species
   biomass? 4) How well does species diversity of forest understorey grass
   layer, calculated from cover data, mirror that calculated from biomass
   data? Location: Nagarahole National Park, India. Methods: We estimated
   the abundance of graminoids through visual estimation of cover and
   weighed harvested biomass in forest and grassland plots. In forests, two
   estimates of total graminoid abundance (total graminoid cover and sum of
   species covers) were used. In the grassland, only total graminoid
   abundance was measured. We examined the relationship between cover
   estimates and biomass, and the additional utility of height in
   predicting biomass, using multiple regressions and AIC-based model
   selection. We also assessed similarity in cover- and biomass-based
   Simpson's and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices using regressions.
   Results: Graminoid cover explained a large portion of variation in total
   graminoid biomass in forest and grassland habitats. The sum of species
   covers was better than total cover in estimating total graminoid biomass
   in the forests. The benefit of including height to estimate total
   biomass was moderate in forests but substantial in grasslands. Cover
   estimates were good proxies of food species biomass, and the addition of
   height did not yield better models for most species. Species diversity
   indices calculated from cover largely matched those based on biomass.
   Conclusions: Visual estimation of species cover is a good alternative to
   biomass harvesting for rapid assessment of abundance of graminoids

   existence of dense high-mountain pine woodlands dominated by Pinus
   sylvestris/nigra from the Late Iron Age to the Muslim period. Later,
   from the Christian period, anthropogenic activities have intensified,
   especially livestock grazing in the Contemporary Age. Its consequences
   are the progressive disappearance of high-mountain pine forests and the
   extension of grasslands by means of fire, which has shaped current

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the efficacy of herbivore grazing intensity in
   preserving soil nematode biodiversity and microbial biomass in the
   alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau. Grazing intensities of lightly
   (LG), medially (MG) and heavily grazed (HG) treatments were compared in
   terms of their influence on microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen
   (MBN) and nematode diversity in May, July and September, 2014. We show
   that MG was associated with the highest MBC, MBN, and nematode diversity
   indices in July. We also show that grazing had different effects on
   various nematode trophic groups. HG decreased the density of
   bacterivores of coloniser-persister 3 (Ba3) guild and predators of
   coloniser-persister 4 guild (Pr4), but increased the plant feeders of
   coloniser-persister 2 (Pf2) guild over all sampling times. The overall
   densities of predators and omnivores were low in HG resulting in a low
   free-living nematode maturity index (MI) and the structure index (SI)
   across all sampling times. The higher density of bacterivores led to the
   higher value of the nematode channel ratio (NCR) in LG in May and
   September. The value of the enrichment index (EI) was highest on MG
   across all the sampling times. The research suggested that medially
   grazed intensity is conducive to biodiversity of soil fauna and
   belowground biomass in the middle plant growth period.}},

Title = {{Managing grassland for wildlife: the effects of rotational burning on
   tick presence and abundance in African savannah habitat}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Ticks are obligate blood-feeding ectoparasites that have negative
   effects on animals through blood loss and vectoring disease. Controlling
   ticks is a major aspect of wildlife management in many areas, including
   African savannah where ticks are a long-standing problem. Rotational
   burning of vegetation is widely thought to reduce ticks but empirical
   data are lacking. We investigate the effect of block rotational burning
   on tick populations in a South African wildlife reserve. We measured
   tick presence/abundance using tick drags in multiple blocks of five
   different burn ages (areas burned 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 years previously). We
   also assessed herbivore diversity using dung as a proxy. Tick presence
   was highest in areas burned 2-3 years previously. It was lowest in
   recently-burned areas (probably due to fire-induced mortality or loss of
   field-layer refugia) and areas burned >= 4 years previously (probably
   because the lack of palatable grass meant herbivore abundance was lower;
   this is supported by significantly lower herbivore presence in old burns
   and significant positive correlation between tick numbers and herbivore
   presence). Burn age and, to a lesser extent, block, were significantly
   related to tick presence and abundance at both larval and nymph stages.
   The model that best explained tick numbers, though, included the
   interaction between burn age and block due to substantial inter-block
   variability in mid-burn blocks relative to lower variability in blocks
   at the start or end of the burn cycle. This suggests that burn age and
   block-specific conditions together influence tick abundance, with
   habitat heterogeneity likely being an important modifier of the effect
   burning has on tick numbers. Although annual burning of large areas
   would not be feasible while maintaining suitable grazing, we suggest
   that additional annual burning of potential wildlife (and therefore
   tick) hotspots, such as around waterholes, could reduce tick populations
   and improve wildlife management.}},

   one-year survey of amphipod assemblages from a nearly undisturbed
   Posidonia oceanica meadow are used to investigate the seasonal patterns
   in species abundance and identity. Our results highlight the presence of
   a core group of species inhabiting the meadow throughout the year,
   although an in depth analysis reveals three differentiated seasonal
   assemblages corresponding to autumn, winter, and a warm season
   clustering of both spring and summer. The observed patterns suggest the
   interplay between different mechanisms drives the coexistence of
   amphipods over the whole year, including niche partitioning, predation

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{514-526}},
Abstract = {{The traditional significance of livestock to rural communities in
   Ethiopia has resulted in intense pressures on available grazing areas,
   resulting in vegetation loss, reduced infiltration and increased runoff,
   greater erosion and land degradation. Unfortunately, the uptake of
   sustainable land management (SLM) practices in communal grazing land is
   constrained by a lack of land tenure security. Recently the
   International Fund for Agricultural Development, working with the
   Government of Ethiopia, has invested in the capacity of local
   administrations, to improve land demarcation and the issuance of both
   individual and community land certificates. This is concurrent with the
   promotion of improved SLM, particularly zero grazing of communal lands,
   known by communities as Exclosures. This pilot study reports the
   biophysical changes observed in four different Exclosures in the Amhara
   region compared to adjacent communal lands. Irrespective of age, it was
   found that vegetative cover, biodiversity levels and infiltration rates,
   all increased in Exclosures, enhancing ecosystem services and function.
   Results suggest that Exclosures are most effective for large sites with
   effective cut and carry forage systems. It is evident that the issuance
   of land titles increases the adoption of SLM practices. Further studies
   are required to assess the economic and social impacts of Exclosures.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of wild animals browsing preferences in forage resources}},
Journal = {{ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{208-214}},
Abstract = {{Excessive presence of wild ungulates can produce negative effects on
   herbaceous crops or woody species, and to face this problem, habitat
   improvements are often performed to recreate suitable environments for a
   given animal species and to attract animals far from cultivated crops. A
   common example of these interventions is represented by grassland
   restoration and to evaluate the real animal preferences on restored
   forage resources a proper trial was established in a hilly area of
   Tuscany (central Italy), inside the historical Park of Pratolino, near
   Florence. The trial compared six different forage species or mixtures
   sown in plots: vegetal material was represented by two pure stands
   (Onobrychis viciifolia and Medicago sativa) and four mixtures differing
   in number and kind of used species. Plots were utilised only by wild
   animals occurring in the area. Data collection consisted of botanical
   samples in each plot in different periods to obtain the percent presence
   of each species. At the same time, a visual estimation of animal intake
   on all occurring species was performed to obtain the browsing ratio of
   single species and overall defoliation rate for each species/mixture.
   Moreover, six camera traps were placed on the boundary of the
   experimental site to record videos of wild animals browsing in the area
   for identification of animals actually occurring on different plots and
   for comparison of these results with botanical data. Vegetation surveys
   permitted a proper evaluation of animals intake and of their feeding
   preferences. In general, sown species performed a major role in animal
   browsing, even if in some periods also a few native species (such as
   Plantago lanceolata or Cichorium intybus) were utilised in a strong way,
   depending on vegetation context and existing biomass. Camera traps
   results permitted the identification of browsing animal species (mainly
   represented by roe deer) and plots frequentation resulted to be highly
   related to animal intake found by botanical releves.}},

Title = {{Soil hydrology and vegetation as impacted by goat grazing in Vertisols

Abstract = {{Shrubland ecosystems are less studied than grasslands regarding the role
   of domestic grazing on ecosystem degradation in the world, but
   particularly in Mexico. Of special concern is the paucity of research on
   soil hydrological responses to the impact of livestock. Here, we
   assessed the role that specific soil and surface characteristics play in
   soil hydrology as a response to goat grazing intensity in two different
   soil types, Regosol and Vertisol, in the Tamaulipan thornscrub of
   north-eastern Mexico. At each soil unit, a set of grazing regimes was
   identified, including heavy grazing (HG), moderate grazing (MG) and a
   no-grazing (NG) reference area, and selected soil properties and plant
   cover were evaluated. In Regosol sites, soil organic matter varied among
   all grazing regimes (4.6\% higher on NG and 2.1\% higher on MG with
   respect HG) and no dissimilarities on bulk density were recorded. For
   Vertisol sites, soil bulk density increased with grazing intensity (16\%
   higher on MG and37\% higher on HG with respect to NG) whereas plant
   cover linearly decreased from 86\% in NG to 29\% in MG and 9\% in HG
   sites. Soil organic matter content for Regosol, and plant cover and soil
   bulk density for Vertisol appeared as the best indicators of water
   infiltration and moisture retention for the grazing conditions assessed.
   Differences in those key driving variables may help explain surface
   hydrology responses to goat grazing in rangeland soils of Tamaulipan
   thornscrub ecosystems and possibly on similar rangelands around the
   world. Clear signs of vegetation degradation were also observed,
   manifested by a loss in species diversity and plant cover, especially
   under heavy grazing. This reflects unsustainable livestock management
   practices that should be avoided. This study contributes to improve our
   understanding of rangeland degradation processes and justifies devising
   more sustainable grazing management schemes.}},

Title = {{Impacts of horse grazing on botanical composition and diversity in

Pages = {{375-385}},
Abstract = {{Plant dynamics under horse grazing was studied in a three-year field
   experiment in heather-gorse shrublands in NW Spain. The experimental
   design consisted of three vegetation types with four replicates
   (paddocks): (1) heather (Ericaceae)-dominated (H), (2) gorse (Ulex
   gallii Planch.)-dominated (G), and (3) co-dominated by gorse and
   heath-grasses (GG). Each paddock (1.2 ha) was grazed from May to October
   by two crossbred mature mares (310 +/- 52 kg bodyweight), one dry and
   one lactating (plus foal). Two other paddocks (one in H and one in GG)
   were excluded from grazing. Plant cover and height were sampled three
   times a year (spring, summer, and autumn) with a point-quadrat method.
   Floristic composition and diversity were annually sampled at 10 25-m(2)
   quadrats per paddock. Data were subjected to mixed models for
   repeated-measures and redundancy analyses. Horse grazing resulted in
   overall increases (P < 0.001) in heather and herbaceous cover (from 13\%
   to 27\%, and from 16\% to 23\%, respectively), and decreases (P < 0.001)
   in gorse cover and height (from 35\% to 17\%; from 30 to 25 cm), with
   scarce differences among vegetation types. Floristic diversity (species
   richness and Shannon index) increased more over time in grazed than in
   ungrazed paddocks. Redundancy analyses revealed that grazing effects on
   plant species assemblages depended on vegetation type, and that plant
   communities evolved differently between grazing treatments for both
   abundance and frequency data. Some herbaceous species characteristic of
   heathlands were favoured by horse grazing. Horse grazing reduced gorse
   dominance in G and GG vegetation, controlling excessive accumulation of
   combustible material and reducing fire risk, and promoted the presence
   of species of conservation interest, so it offers a promising management
   tool for the restoration of heathlands and their biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Assessing the impact of historical and future climate change on
   potential natural vegetation types and net primary productivity in
   Australian grazing lands}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{387-400}},
Abstract = {{The study investigated the impact of historical and future climate
   changes on potential natural vegetation (PNV) types and net primary
   productivity (NPP) in Australia, using the Comprehensive and Sequential
   Classification System model and the Miami model coupled with climate of
   the 1931-70 and 1971-2010 periods and the projected climate in 2050.
   Twenty-eight vegetation classes were classified based on the key climate
   indicators with four of them being the major vegetation classes
   corresponding to Australian rangelands and accounting for 75\% of total
   land area. There was a substantial shift in areas of vegetation classes
   from the 1931-70 period to the 1971-2010 period due to the increased
   rainfall over large areas across Australia. The modelling projected a
   range of changes in vegetation classes for 2050 depending on the climate
   change scenario used. Many vegetation classes with more intense land use
   (e.g. steppe and forest) were projected to decrease in 2050, which may
   have significant impact on the grazing industry and biodiversity
   conservation. By 2050, NPP was projected to increase in central and
   northern Australia and to decrease in southern and eastern coastal areas
   and was projected to be higher on average than that of the 1931-70
   period. The vegetation classes approximately corresponding to Australian
   rangelands mostly had increased NPP projections compared with the
   1931-70 period. Although actual response will partially depend on human
   management activities, fire and extreme events, the projected increase
   in average NPP in 2050 indicates that Australian vegetation,
   particularly the rangeland vegetation, will likely be a net carbon sink
   rather than a carbon source by 2050, with the exception of a `warm-dry'
   scenario.}},

Title = {{Scale-dependent effects of grazing on the species richness of alkaline
   and sand grasslands}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{37}},
Pages = {{229-246}},
Abstract = {{Extensively managed pastures harbour rare and endangered species and
   have a decisive role in maintaining grassland biodiversity. Traditional
   herding of local robust cattle breeds is considered as a feasible tool
   for preserving these habitats. We studied the scale-dependent effects of
   grazing on the species richness and composition of three dry grassland
   types in the Great Hungarian Plain: Achilleo setaceae-Festucetum
   pseudovinae and Artemisio santonici-Festucetumpseudovinae alkaline
   grasslands, and Potentillo arenariae-Festucetum pseudovinae sand
   grassland. We asked the following questions: (1) Does extensive grazing
   have a scale-dependent effect on plant species richness of alkaline and
   sand grasslands? (2) How does grazing affect the proportion of
   specialists, generalists and weeds in the three grassland types? We
   sampled ten sites of each grassland type, including five extensively
   grazed and five non-grazed sites (altogether we had 30 sites). We used a
   series of nested plots each consisting of 10 plots from the size of 0.01
   m(2) to 16 m2. We revealed that grazing has contrasting effects in the
   three grassland types, and had a considerable effect on their species
   richness even at small scales. In both alkaline grassland types, total
   species richness was overall higher in grazed plots but it increased in
   a similar manner for both ungrazed and grazed habitats across plot
   sizes. Small-scale heterogeneity likely due to the uneven distribution
   of grazing, trampling and defecation together with mitigated rate of
   competition allowed more species to co-exist even at small scales in
   grazed alkaline grasslands. Grazing increased the richness of
   specialists, but likely due to the salt stress, establishment of weeds
   was hampered. Open gaps formed by trampling likely supported the
   establishment of several specialist species such as Plantago tenuiflora
   and Puccinellia limosa which are typical to open alkali grasslands.
   Contrary, in sand grasslands, we did not detect any effect of grazing on
   total species richness, likely due to the adverse effect of grazing on
   the species richness of specialists and weeds. In contrast with the
   former findings we detected significantly higher species richness in
   0.01 m(2) and 0.0625 m(2) plots in the grazed sand grasslands, but found
   no differences at larger scales. Whilst species richness of specialists
   was significantly decreased, richness of weeds was increased by grazing.
   Decrease in the specialist species richness was likely due to the lack
   of their evolutionary adaptation to grazing. Degradation caused by
   grazing and trampling together with the propagule pressure from the
   neighbouring anthropogenic habitats resulted in an increased richness of
   weeds in the grazed sites.}},

Title = {{Functional diversity increases ecological stability in a grazed
   grassland}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{183}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{831-840}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the factors governing ecological stability in variable
   environments is a central focus of ecology. Functional diversity can
   stabilize ecosystem function over time if one group of species
   compensates for an environmentally driven decline in another. Although
   intuitively appealing, evidence for this pattern is mixed. We
   hypothesized that diverse functional responses to rainfall will increase
   the stability of vegetation cover and biomass across rainfall
   conditions, but that this effect depends on land-use legacies that
   maintain functional diversity. We experimentally manipulated grazing in
   a California grassland to create land-use legacies of low and moderate
   grazing, across which we implemented rainout shelters and irrigation to
   create dry and wet conditions over 3 years. We found that the stability
   of the vegetation cover was greatly elevated and the stability of the
   biomass was slightly elevated across rainfall conditions in areas with
   histories of moderate grazing. Initial functional diversity-both in the
   seed bank and aboveground-was also greater in areas that had been
   moderately grazed. Rainfall conditions in conjunction with this grazing
   legacy led to different functional diversity patterns over time. Wet
   conditions led to rapid declines in functional diversity and a
   convergence on resource-acquisitive traits. In contrast, consecutively
   dry conditions maintained but did not increase functional diversity over
   time. As a result, grazing practices and environmental conditions that
   decrease functional diversity may be associated with lasting effects on
   the response of ecosystem functions to drought. Our results demonstrate
   that theorized relationships between diversity and stability are
   applicable and important in the context of working grazed landscapes.}},

   plant biomass in wetlands of the central western coast of the Gulf of
   Mexico}},
Journal = {{ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{79-99}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims: Wetlands are highly productive ecosystems, which
   provide many environmental services. However, they are one of the most
   threatened due to human activities such as agriculture and livestock.
   Mexico has lost 62\% of its wetlands and specifically those of the
   central coast of the Gulf of Mexico are being affected due to livestock
   pressure. There are very few studies about the subject, so in this paper
   we analyze the effect of livestock and seasonality on floristic
   composition, above ground biomass (AB) and below ground biomass (BB) of
   the Alvarado lagoon, Veracruz, Mexico.
   Methods: We selected two working locations, and in each locality chose
   two sampling sites. In each site, we placed eight 1 m(2) plots of four
   different locations (half were fenced to keep out livestock). For an
   entire year we obtained species richness and diversity, and data on
   vegetation cover, as well as AB and BB. With the data obtained, we
   calculated the Relative Importance Value (RIV) by species and the
   relative replacement rate of species.
   Key results: Total richness resulted in 29 species. A disturbance
   gradient was observed, with the best conserved sites in Rio Blanco. In
   most sites, species richness was significantly higher in rainfall and
   species with high RIV were typical wetland species, although there were
   dominant grasses in both climatic seasons. BB was significantly higher
   in one location of Rio Blanco, and AB in one location of Rio Blanco and
   in one from Rio Limon. During the rainy season, AB was higher in half of
   the sites.
   Conclusions: We conclude that freshwater wetlands can retain their
   ecological functions in the presence of livestock as long as the impact
   is low. Even if there is cattle grazing with a controlled management, it
   can promote diversity of native wetland species and limit the growth of
   invasive grasses.}},

Journal = {{CLIMATE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{73}},

Pages = {{17-29}},
Abstract = {{The state of, and changes to, altitudinal and polar treeline ecosystems
   and their services in selected mountain regions in Europe were analyzed
   using the drivers-pressures-state-impacts-responses (DPSIR) framework.
   The analysis was based on 45 responses of experts from 19 countries to 2
   semi-structured questionnaires on treeline ecosystem services (ESs),
   stakeholders and the DPSIR factors, and 11 case study descriptions of
   best management practices. The experts recognized climate and land-use
   changes as the main drivers, resulting in various pressures that
   contrasted among the regions. The impacts of the pressures were mainly
   considered as negative (e.g. loss of biodiversity, root rot diseases,
   moth and bark beetle outbreaks, wild fires, decrease of (sub) alpine
   grasslands, browsing), but also as positive (e.g. increase in forested
   area). The influence of climate warming, altered precipitation regimes,
   a longer growing season, annual variation in winter climate and
   increased ground-level ozone concentrations were considered less
   critical for recent treeline dynamics than land abandonment, increased
   tourism and livestock pressure. Current policy responses to emerging
   pressures and stakeholder demands were considered insufficient and
   incoherent. Mitigation, adaptation and restoration actions were rare and
   with no evident long-term impact. We conclude that (1) locally-specific
   human-environment interactions have greater influence on treeline
   dynamics than global warming; (2) ecological and social sustainability
   of the treeline areas can be enhanced by simultaneously promoting
   traditional land use and regulating tourism development; (3) ES users
   should look for new opportunities arising from environmental change
   rather than trying to sustain current levels of ESs indefinitely; and
   (4) to safeguard the unique ecological and social values of treeline
   areas, more coherent and proactive policies are needed.}},

Title = {{Sensitivity to environmental change of the treeline ecotone and its
   associated biodiversity in European mountains}},
Journal = {{CLIMATE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{151-166}},
Abstract = {{Transition zones between mountain forests and treeless tundra, i.e.
   treeline ecotones, are characterized by great regional variety. In this
   paper, we discuss the biodiversity in various trophic levels in treeline
   ecotones throughout Europe, with particular focus on recent changes in
   land use and climate in northern and central mountains. In northernmost
   Europe, mountain birch prevails, while conifers (spruce, pine, larch)
   are the dominating species further south. While at continent-wide to
   global scales, the ecotone position is largely controlled by heat
   deficiency, it depends on a multitude of partly interacting abiotic and
   biotic factors other than climate at smaller scales. Climate change is a
   driving factor in treeline ecotone change, including physiognomic
   structure and biodiversity, although the effects of climate and other
   factors often overlap. Historical legacy plays an important role in this
   respect, and human impacts are particularly important. The recent
   decline in pastoral use of many European treeline areas often strongly
   influences plant diversity and re-growth of trees and other woody
   species. Climate change together with changing tree cover may influence
   snow cover, moisture regime, and nutrient conditions. Subsequently
   changed site conditions influence plant-plant interactions, favoring
   some species and disfavoring others, and plant-animal interactions.
   Native animals may cause widespread or local disturbances in treeline
   ecotone areas. Mass outbreaks of leaf-eating insects, for example,
   usually affect comparatively large forested areas whereas mammalian
   herbivores and birds have more local impact. However, high numbers of
   wild or domestic mammalian herbivores may challenge the carrying
   capacity of treeline ecotone areas at the same time as they preserve an
   open pasture character. This calls for cross-disciplinary study
   approaches, addressing the complexity of the ecotone regarding both
   causal background and biogeographic diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The study was conducted in Taftan rangeland in Sistan and Baluchestan,
   Iran, to study the effects of grazing exclusion on reclamation of
   vegetation cover and soil properties. After a comprehensive assessment
   of the vegetation types, plant sampling was carried out in sampling
   stands (50 x 50 m). In each stand, vegetation properties were measured
   using simple transect lines (50 m) method within quadrats (5 x 5 m),
   with a systematically randomized method. Soil sampling (75 samples) was
   performed along transects from the surface layer (0-30 cm). Results
   showed that livestock exclusion significantly affected community
   characteristics. The species richness (14.32), diversity (2.97), and
   plant cover (65.14\%) showed their maximum level in the 15-year
   exclusion. The soil nutrient content increased during exclusion. Organic
   carbon (4.20\%), total nitrogen (1.12\%), available potassium (393.33 mg
   kg(-1)), and available phosphorus content (17.13 mg kg(-1)) attained
   significantly greater values under the long-term exclusion. The soil pH
   level (8.93) was significantly higher in the overgrazed site compared to
   the grazing exclusion sites. The soil electrical conductivity was
   statistically similar under the three treatments. The amounts of silt
   (63.40\%) and clay (14\%) were greater in the long-term exclusion
   compared with overgrazed rangeland. The long-term exclusion showed the
   lowest amount of sand (22.50\%). These results imply that livestock
   exclusion plays an important role in vegetation restoration and soil
   conservation of degraded ecosystems in arid regions. We suggest that
   more studies are required to investigate the effect of livestock
   exclusion on ecosystem process in the arid rangeland regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is aimed at providing a comprehensive review of environmental
   issues related to beef cattle farming in France, including available

   farms (calf-to-weanling) due to the long breeding time necessary to
   produce weanlings. The results were, however, very different when they
   were expressed per hectare, when carbon storage by soil was taken into
   account and when the positive impacts of these systems on biodiversity
   were included in the analysis. Despite a certain advantage for making a
   transition towards agroecology due to the large part of permanent

Abstract = {{Overgrazing has caused extensively vegetation destruction in deserts,
   the widely distributed type of grassland in northern Xinjiang, China. To
   restore the degraded desert ecosystems, grazing exclusion (GE) was
   extensively implemented in recent decades. However, changes in the
   vegetation characteristics and plant biodiversity in different years of
   GE have not been thoroughly elucidated. This study paper examines the
   changes in desert community characteristics (i.e., biomass, coverage,
   density) and plant biodiversity (i.e. Margelef richness index, Simpson
   dominance index and Pielou evenness index) under lightly degraded desert
   (LD) in Urumqi with freely grazing (FG), 1 a, 6 a,9 a and moderately
   degraded desert (MD) in Shawan with FG, 1 a, 4 a, 11 a. The results
   indicated that the vegetation density and biomass in LD had no
   statistical difference response to GE, while compared with FG, the
   coverage and biomass of GE sites in MD sigiiificantly increased by
   36.9\%-115.7\% and 62.9\%-217.5\%, respectively. Relative short-term GE
   could increase Simpson dominance index and Margelef richness index in
   LD, but the Simpson dominance index and Pielou evenness index reduced in
   relative long-term GE condition. In addition, we suggests that the
   optimal vegetation biomass and plants growth condition of LD and MD were
   calculated and observed at the 4-5 a and 7-11 a in our study areas,
   respectively. Hence, we proposed that degraded deserts should adopt the
   grazing management when it recovered to a certain extent.}},

Number = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Traditional orchards are a valuable feature of the rural landscape and
   they are specific for regions with scattered settlement such as the
   Myjava hilly land and White Carpathians. Here, the permanent
   species-rich grasslands beneath trees were regularly managed in the
   traditional manner until some were replaced in the 1970's and 80's by
   intensively managed orchards, some of which were abandoned in the early
   1990's. Our 2011-2015 phytosociological research followed the standard
   Braun-Blanquet approach. We classified 178 phytosociological releves
   recorded in orchard meadows (156 releves), former intensively managed
   orchards (16 releves), and two releves from a semi-intensively grazed
   orchard. Traditionally managed orchard meadows were classified in the
   following five units: (i) Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum
   elatioris-thermophilous variant, (ii) Pastinaco sativae-Arrhenatheretum
   elatioris - transitional variant to Alchemillo-Arrhenatheretum
   elatioris, (iii) Ranunculo bulbosi-Arrhenatheretum elatioris, (iv)
   Onobrychido viciifoliae-Brometum erecti, and (v) Brachypodio
   pinnati-Molinietum arundinaceae. Formerly intensively managed
   large-scale orchards were classified as Pastinaco
   sativae-Arrhenatheretum elatioris association and the semi-intensively
   grazed orchard as Lolio perennis-Cynosuretum cristati association. The
   species composition varies considerably due to tree-shading and
   different management treatments applied in the orchards, so the releves
   of the delimited syntaxonomic units are not typical and have
   transitional character. Moisture, soil nutrients, and soil reaction were
   identified as the main environmental gradients influencing species
   composition. We tested four management treatments in direct gradient
   analysis and found that abandonment has the strongest effect on species
   composition. Comparison of grassland vegetation in the studied
   traditional orchards with that described in Germany reveals differences
   in species composition. Moreover, species richness of the compared
   Arrhenatherion elatioris and Bromion erecti alliances in Slovakian
   orchard meadows was higher than in the German orchards.}},

Abstract = {{The livestock sector provides more than one-third of human protein needs
   and is a major provider of livelihood in almost all developing
   countries. While providing such immense benefits to the population, poor
   livestock management can potentially provide harmful environmental
   impacts at local, regional, and national levels which have not been
   adequately addressed in many countries with emerging economies.
   Twenty-six percent of global land area is used for livestock production
   and forest lands are continuously being lost to such activities. Land
   degradation through soil erosion and nutrient depletion is very common
   across pastures and rangelands. The intensification of livestock
   production led to large surpluses of on-farm nitrogen and phosphorus
   inputs that can potentially contribute to nonpoint source pollution of
   water resources in many parts of the world. The sector is one of the
   largest sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) contributing around 14.5\% of
   all human-induced GHG emissions, a major driver of use and pollution of
   freshwater (accounting 10\% anthropogenic water use) and a contributor
   to the loss of biodiversity. About 60\% of global biomass harvested
   annually to support all human activity is consumed by livestock
   industry, undermining the sustainability of allocating such large
   resource to the industry. Despite the negative impacts of livestock
   production, opportunities exist to balance the competing demands of
   livestock production and the environment. These include (1) improved
   technologies and practices that increase livestock productivity with
   optimal use of land and water, (2) reorienting grazing systems to
   provide environmental services for water, biodiversity, carbon
   sequestration, and resource conservation, (3) reducing GHG emission from
   livestock production, and (4) an effective management strategy for
   efficient and sustainable use of manure in livestock production. Further
   research, appropriate policy development, and institutional support are
   important to ensure the competitiveness of the industry. Integration of
   crops with livestock production provides opportunities for increasing
   resource use efficiencies and reducing environmental pollution, making
   the system resilient to impacts of climate change, reducing GHG
   emissions from the system, enhancing soil quality and fertility, and
   improving water quantity and quality. Appropriate techniques for
   assessing and monitoring impacts of livestock production are necessary
   for developing strategies and making the system profitable, sustainable,
   and resilient. Isotopic and nuclear techniques play an important role in
   such assessment and monitoring.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Methods for Restoring Meadows Invaded by Solidago Species}},
Journal = {{POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural meadows are valuable for maintaining biodiversity and
   providing a range of ecosystem services. The majority of these
   communities are protected by the European Natura 2000 system. However,
   grasslands are threatened by invasions by alien species, particularly
   Solidago spp. The invaders should be eradicated because of their
   negative impact on biodiversity, the environment, and the economy. A
   field experiment was conducted to compare the effect of different
   treatments (scalping, rototilling, and use of herbicide) on restoration
   of a meadow seriously invaded by Solidago spp. Fresh hay was transferred
   to the experimental plots to provide target meadow species seeds.
   Significant differences in species composition and coverage were
   detected between the herbicide-treated and plots that received other
   treatments and between the use of a rototiller and the control. Applying
   the herbicide glyphosate quickly reduced the cover of Solidago spp. (0.5
   +/- 0.4\%) and increased target species cover (84.8 +/- 13.6\%). The
   Solidago spp. cover rates were 79.5 +/- 17.1\% and 65 +/- 31.4\% when
   scalping and rototilling were used, respectively, whereas the target
   species cover rates were 25.8 +/- 16\% and 30 +/- 15.8\%, respectively.
   The sward that grew after applying glyphosate had the highest forage
   value and resistance to cutting. These results show that short-term
   eradication of invasive Solidago spp. and restoration of a meadow are
   possible using glyphosate. However, use of a herbicide may have a
   negative impact on the environment and native species.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of my research is to determine the impact of soil factors and
   management systems on the vegetation composition of the Yukarisevindikli
   natural pasture in Teldrdag, Turkey. Measurements in the pasture were
   taken during three different management systems (grazed, abandoned, and
   mowed). Multivariate relationships between environmental variables and
   vegetation composition were determined using redundancy analysis (RDA)
   using the CANOCO (4.5) program. This research found that soil parameters
   and management systems had effects on dry matter yield and pasture
   species in the Yukarisevindikli pasture. Using RDA, which is among the
   ordination analyses, the effect of environmental factors on species
   distribution and dry matter yield was found to be very important on each
   axis. It was determined that Lolium perenne is common on certain sites
   that are mown and protected while Vulpia ciliata among graminae is the
   plant of grazed sites. In the study, it was determined that the low
   amount of organic matter and soil nutrients in grazed pasture sites
   negatively affects both the plant species composition and dry matter
   yield. The method of usage and soil structure will comprise an important
   function in the success of pasture management and overall improvement by
   assessing the collected data. In this context, the protection of the
   pasture and not allowing heavy grazing from time to time will ensure
   that the pasture can be used more profitably. As a result, in the
   future, similar studies should be conducted to understand better the
   dynamics of a pasture eco-system in natural areas.}},

Title = {{Plant species selection by sheep in semi-natural dry grasslands
   extensively grazed in the south-western Italian Alps}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{123-131}},
Abstract = {{Sheep can have an important role in the conservation of abandoned and
   shrub- and tree-encroached, semi-natural dry grasslands because their
   feeding behaviour is known to affect plant diversity and structure.
   Nevertheless, little information is available about feeding preferences
   of sheep at the sward-patch scale and about the effects of stocking
   density on their selectivity. Consequently, we investigated plant-
   species selection by sheep managed with a low-intensity grazing,
   examining the influence of stocking density and plant species abundance
   by means of vegetation surveys and animal GPS tracking. Sheep grazed a
   graminoid-dominated, semi-natural dry grassland (Festuco-Brometea) in
   Piedmont Region, north-west Italy. Plant species, classified into
   graminoids, suffruticose forbs, and herbaceous forbs, were selected with
   a different intensity by sheep, which preferred graminoids over
   suffruticose and herbaceous forbs. Plant species showing a high
   consumption ratio (CR), i.e. the level of selection of plant species (CR
   > 10\%), were mostly graminoids (e.g. Bromus erectus, Koeleria
   vallesiana and Stipa pennata). Furthermore, Carex species were also
   noticeably selected, in particular C. humilis, whereas spiny species and
   those with a rosette or prostrate forms were rarely grazed. The
   heterogeneity of stocking density over the pasture allowed testing of
   the relationships between stocking density and CR. For many species, the
   higher the stocking density, the higher was the CR, regardless of the
   abundance of dominant neighbouring species. Results suggest that sheep
   under low-intensity grazing conditions exert a specific plant- species
   selection in abandoned dry grasslands. By regulating the stocking
   density through the management of grazing sheep, it may be possible to
   condition the consumption of certain plant species, with
   medium-long-term effects on the botanical composition.}},

Title = {{Disturbance-dependent invasion of the woody weed, Calotropis procera, in
   Australian rangelands}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{201-211}},
Abstract = {{Plant invasions are threats to biodiversity and ecosystem processes that
   have far reaching ecological and economic impacts. Understanding the
   mechanisms of invasion essentially helps in developing effective
   management strategies. Rubber bush (Calotropis procera) is an introduced
   milkweed that invades Australian beef production rangelands. Its
   establishment is often associated with disturbances caused by pastoral
   management practices. We examined whether or not rubber bush (1)
   outcompetes native grasses, (2) can invade intact rangeland, and (3) if
   disturbance facilitates rubber bush establishment and spread in grassy
   rangelands. We measured the competitive response of different densities
   of Mitchell grass (Astrebla pectinata) individuals and the competitive
   effects of associate rubber bush seedlings in an additive common garden
   experiment. Replicated field exclosure experiments, under
   grass-dominated and tropical savanna woodland conditions examined the
   effect of increasing levels of disturbance on rubber bush seedling
   emergence. The dominant native Mitchell grass was a stronger competitor
   than rubber bush when grown together under greenhouse conditions,
   whereby root and shoot biomass yields were more restricted in rubber
   bush compared with Mitchell grass. This finding was corroborated in the
   field exclosure experiments at both sites, where seedling emergence
   increased 5-fold in seeded and highly disturbed plots where superficial
   soils were turned over by treatments simulating heavy grazing and
   trampling by cattle or machinery. Emergence of rubber bush seedlings in
   seeded plots that were undisturbed, clipped and grazed was minimal and
   rubber bush seedlings did not survive the seedling stage in these plots.
   These results demonstrate that disturbance to the superficial soil
   stratum affects the ability of rubber bush seeds to successfully
   establish in a microsite, and high levels of soil disturbance
   substantially increase establishment. Thus, rubber bush is a poor
   competitor of Mitchell grass and does not invade intact grassland.
   Consequently, rubber bush invasion is disturbance-dependent in the vast
   Australian rangelands. The spread of this weed may be arrested by
   management practices that minimise disturbances to grass cover.}},

Abstract = {{Fencing is the common management practice to restore degraded
   grasslands. However, long-term fencing decreases grassland productivity
   and species diversity. The study was therefore conducted as a three-year
   (2011-2013) experiment with a randomized complete block in a grassland
   fenced for 20 years in the Loess Plateau of China, and the effects of
   fertilization, burning and grazing on aboveground biomass, species and
   functional group composition, species and some functional group
   diversity were analysed. Our results showed that the functional group of
   perennial bunchgrasses dominated the grassland regardless of management
   practices. However, burning altered species composition (i.e. the
   unpalatable species, Artemisia sacrorum) more significantly than
   fertilization or grazing, and surprisingly, nearly quadrupled the
   functional group of shrubs and semi-shrubs. Fertilization had a positive
   effect on the aboveground biomass (44.0\%), while clearly reducing
   species diversity (21.9\%). Grazing decreased aboveground biomass, but
   increased species diversity by 15.9\%. This study indicated that
   fertilization influenced plant community through its impact on
   aboveground biomass, while burning changed plant community by altering
   dominant species. Thus, it was concluded that fertilizer could further
   improve community biomass while burning reduced the edibility of grass.
   Grazing could be carried out to enhance the biodiversity in the
   long-term fenced grasslands.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{95-102}},
Abstract = {{The rarity of native grasslands in agricultural districts heightens the
   requirement for optimal management to maintain diversity. Previous
   studies have suggested that disturbance is required to maintain species
   diversity in temperate Australian grasslands, but grasslands in semiarid
   environments do not have the same disturbance requirement. The current
   study examines the short-term responses to disturbance of subtropical
   grassland of the Darling Downs, south-eastern Queensland. We also
   compare temperate and subtropical grasslands in terms of biomass and
   rainfall. A field experiment was established with treatments, including
   burning in 2013, burning in 2014, burning in both years, mowing in both
   years, mowing and raking in both years, and an undisturbed control.
   Treatments were replicated at each of seven sampling stations in similar
   environments. The initial sampling after 2013 followed a wet summer and
   the final sampling was in 2015 after a dry summer. Non-metric
   multi-dimensional scaling showed that environmental differences,
   including silt content, soil pH, waterlogging and rainfall history, had
   more effect on the variation in species composition than did the
   treatments. The treatments engendered no significant response in species
   diversity. Of 51 widespread species, only four had a significant change
   in abundance in response to treatment. Herbaceous biomass was higher in
   temperate than subtropical grassland after a dry period. The grassland
   sward may be more open in the subtropics than in temperate grassland
   because of higher decomposition rates. A comparison of rainfall
   distribution between subtropical grassland and temperate grassland
   indicated that droughts are much more frequent in the former
   environments. These occasional droughts may provide a stress that
   reduces perennial grass cover, supplanting the requirement for grazing
   or fire to maintain plant diversity in grasslands. The management of
   grassland remnants in the subtropics, therefore, seems straightforward
   because there is little response in species richness or composition to
   disturbance. However, soil disturbance should be avoided to ensure that
   exotic species do not proliferate.}},

Title = {{Dung Beetles Associated with Agroecosystems of Southern Brazil:
   Relationship with Soil Properties}},
Journal = {{REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{41}},
Abstract = {{Knowing the biodiversity of dung beetles in agricultural and livestock
   environments is the basis for understanding the contribution that these
   organisms make in nutrient cycling and ecosystem functions. The aim of
   the present study was to investigate the structure of copronecrophagous
   dung beetle communities inhabiting the main agroecosystems in southern
   Brazil and correlate the presence of these organisms with soil
   properties. From December 2012 to April 2013, samples of dung beetles
   were taken in the municipality of Tubarao, Santa Catarina, Brazil (28
   degrees 28' S; 48 degrees 56' W) in corn, bean, and sugarcane crops, and
   in cattle pastures. Beetles were captured in 16 sampling sites, four
   from each agroecosystem, following a standardized methodology: 10 baited
   pitfall traps (feces and rotting meat) at a spacing of 50 m with
   exposure for 48 h. The beetles were identified, weighed, and measured.
   Soil analyses were performed in order to correlate data on organic
   matter, texture, macro and micronutrients, and pH with data on the
   abundance of beetle species using canonical correspondence analysis. A
   total of 110 individuals belonging to 10 species of dung beetles was
   found. Twenty-four individuals from seven species (with total biomass of
   2.4 g) were found in the corn crop; five individuals from three species
   (1.8 g) were found in the bean crop; 81 individuals from nine species
   (30.3 g) were found in cattle pasture areas; and lastly, there were no
   dung beetles recorded in the sugarcane crop. In areas of cattle grazing,
   the tunnelers Dichotomius nisus and Trichillum externepunctatum
   correlated positively with organic matter content, whereas the roller
   species Canthon chalybaeus correlated positively with soil texture,
   preferring sandier soils. In corn crop areas, D. nisus was again
   correlated with organic matter content. Paracoprid dung beetle species
   were correlated with organic matter content in the soil, and species
   belonging to the roller functional group were associated with soil
   texture in the corn crop, preferring sandy soils. Information regarding
   the relationship of dung beetles with physical-chemical soil properties
   may be an important strategy for increasing fertility and management of
   soil conservation in agroecosystems.}},

Title = {{Managing competitive interactions to promote regeneration of native
   perennial grasses in semi-arid south-eastern Australia}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-71}},
Abstract = {{Treatments to reduce available soil nitrogen and achieve specified
   levels of weed control were evaluated for their capacity to promote
   regeneration of native perennial grasses in a degraded semi-arid
   woodland in central-western New South Wales. Treatments were factorial
   combinations of nitrogen-reduction levels and weed-control levels. The
   four levels of nitrogen reduction were no intervention, and oversowing
   of an unfertilised summer crop, an unfertilised winter crop or an
   unfertilised perennial grass. The three weed-control levels were defined
   by the outcome sought rather than the chemical applied and were nil,
   control of annual legumes and control of all annual species (AA).
   Regeneration of perennial grasses, predominantly Enteropogon acicularis,
   was promoted most rapidly by theAAlevel of weed control with no
   introduction of sown species. Sown species negated the benefits of weed
   control and limited but did not prevent the regeneration of native
   perennials. Sown species also contributed substantially to biomass
   production, which was otherwise severely limited under theAAlevel of
   weed control, and they were effective in reducing soil nitrogen
   availability. Sown species in combination with appropriate herbicide use
   can therefore maintain or increase available forage in the short-medium
   term, permit a low rate of native perennial grass recruitment, and
   condition the system (by reducing soil mineral nitrogen) for more rapid
   regeneration of native perennials should annual sowings be discontinued
   or a sown grass fail to persist.
   Soil nitrate was reduced roughly in proportion to biomass production.
   High levels of soil nitrate did not inhibit native perennial grass
   regeneration when biomass was suppressed by AA weed control, and may be
   beneficial for pastoral production, but could also render sites more
   susceptible to future invasion of exotic annuals. The need for astute
   grazing management of the restored grassland is thus emphasised. This
   study was conducted on a site that supported a remnant population of
   perennial grasses. Use of the nitrogen-reduction techniques described
   may not be appropriate on sites where very few perennial grass plants
   remain.}},

   composition and soil properties of mountain mesic meadows}},
Journal = {{ACTA SOCIETATIS BOTANICORUM POLONIAE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Due to social and economic changes which have occurred in the last
   decades, many meadows located in mountain regions have ceased to be
   used. Abandonment of meadows leads to the degradation of their species
   composition. An example of degradation may be seen in the development of
   patches dominated by Calamagrostis epigejos. The aim of this research
   was to determine the influence of C. epigejos in its consecutive
   expansion stages on qualitative properties of meadow sward and on
   selected physico-chemical properties of soils. The study revealed strong
   degradation of mountain meadows due to the expansion of C. epigejos. The
   degradation manifested in a decrease in species diversity, a decline of
   species typical for mesic meadows, and an increased proportion of
   synanthropic species. The increase in aboveground biomass of C. epigejos
   strongly reduced the biomass of other species, while underground biomass
   had no effect on accompanying species. However, only a small impact of
   C. epigejos expansion on soil degradation was detected. The cumulating
   plant necromass dominated by this species caused a decrease in diversity
   indices and, at the same time, an increase in exchangeable forms of
   potassium and phosphorus in the soil.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{18-27}},

Abstract = {{Aims: We investigated urban grasslands to: (1) explore current patterns
   of plant species richness in high-maintenance vs low-maintenance
   grasslands, (2) investigate environmental drivers of plant species
   richness and composition, and (3) derive management recommendations and
   assess the potential for plant species introduction.
   Location: Cities of Cologne (50 degrees 56' N, 6 degrees 57' E) and
   Munster (51 degrees 57' N, 7 degrees 37'E), North Rhine-Westphalia,
   Germany.
   Methods: We performed plant inventories and measured soil and
   above-ground biomass characteristics in 100 urban grasslands in two
   cities differing in population size and environmental setting. The data
   set covered 35 high-maintenance grasslands, which are cut ormulched up
   to 14 times a year, and 65 low-maintenance grasslands with one to two
   cuts per year or sheep grazing. We used ANCOVA and DCA to assess drivers
   of vegetation composition and species richness. The floristic potential
   and options to restore biodiversity were assessed taking into account
   maintenance intensity and key abiotic variables of the grasslands using
   thresholds derived from published literature and our own data.
   Results: High-maintenance urban grasslands harboured significantly lower
   plant species richness compared to low-maintenance grasslands. However,
   plant species richness of both grassland types turned out to be lower
   than that of comparable semi-natural agricultural grasslands. Floristic
   composition was primarily conditioned by maintenance intensity, but for
   plant species richness environmental factors such as soil pH, phosphorus
   availability and city were additionally important. Just eight of the 100
   studied urban grasslands were found to be already valuable and
   species-rich, whereas the vast majority showed relatively low species
   richness but a high potential for species introduction.
   Conclusions: Apparently, most urban grasslands exhibited quite
   constrained plant species richness, suffering from high-maintenance
   intensity but probably also from dispersal and seed limitations.
   Nevertheless, as the majority of the studied grasslands showed
   favourable abiotic preconditions for higher plant species richness,
   restoration techniques using species introduction could be an easy and
   promising method to support grassland biodiversity in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Does reintroducing grassland management aid in the recovery
   of vegetation with high grassland species diversity in abandoned
   semi-natural grasslands? How do management tools and local topographic
   factors influence themagnitude of recovery? Do effective restoration
   tools and sites differ depending onmeasurement indices (community-and
   species-level responses)?
   Location: Semi-natural grasslands surrounding Mt. Aso, Kumamoto
   Prefecture, Japan.
   Methods: We conducted vegetation surveys in grassland sites with two
   land-use forms (continuously managed/restored after abandonment) and two
   management types (burning only/burning and mowing). We assessed
   restoration success by examining plant species composition using the
   similarity index. We also examined the community-level (i.e. species
   richness) and species-level (i.e. species occurrence) responses to
   land-use form, management type and local topographic factors (elevation
   and slope aspect).
   Results: Reintroduction of grassland management can recover the plant
   species composition of restored sites. Combined burning and mowing
   management was a principal determinant of the species richness and
   occurrence of most grassland species. A north-facing slope was a clear
   topographic determinant of higher species richness. However, we also
   found that the presence of some of the grassland's endangered species
   (i.e. Achillea alpina subsp. subcartilaginea, Artemisia stolonifera and
   Viola orientalis) was limited in continuously managed sites and that the
   response to topographic factorswas species-specific.
   Conclusions: The reintroduction of combined burning and mowing
   management in various topographic areas is essential for both plant
   diversity recovery and local endangered species conservation for the
   restoration of abandoned semi-natural grasslands. Our results also
   suggest that selecting restoration sites on northern slopes can enhance
   the recovery of plant species diversity.}},

Title = {{Regeneration dynamics of woody vegetation in a Mediterranean landscape
   under different disturbance-based management treatments}},
Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{106-114}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Question: Mediterranean landscapes have been affected for millennia by
   agro-pastoral disturbances such as grazing and vegetation clearing.
   Increased levels of fine-scale habitat heterogeneity that resulted from
   these disturbances contribute to reduced wildfire risk and increased
   species diversity. Disturbance-based management tools utilize
   disturbances in order to promote biodiversity and reduce fire risk, but
   are complicated to apply effectively due to the natural regeneration
   ability of many woody species following disturbances. Therefore, their
   successful application requires a better understanding of woody
   regeneration dynamics. Here, we asked how disturbance-based management
   treatments affected the spatiotemporal dynamics of woody vegetation
   across 11 yrs in a Mediterranean landscape.
   Location: Ramat HaNadiv LTER, northern Israel.
   Methods: We analysed vegetation dynamics in a field experiment
   comprising five treatments: cattle grazing, goat grazing, shrub
   clearing, shrub clearing followed by goat grazing and undisturbed
   control. We used image analysis of high-resolution aerial photographs to
   map woody patches in our study plots. We then quantified the spatial
   pattern of woody vegetation using multiple landscape indices, and
   conducted a comparative analysis of woody regeneration rates under
   different management treatments.
   Results: Cattle grazing did not inhibit woody regeneration, as
   regeneration rates were similar to those found in undisturbed control
   plots. Shrub clearing led to rapid woody regeneration (7\% yr(-1)),
   while a combination of shrub clearing and intense goat grazing halted
   woody regeneration completely. Finally, intense goat grazing not only
   prevented woody regeneration but led to significant decline inwoody
   cover (1\% yr(-1)).
   Conclusions: Our results highlight the rapid regenerative response of
   woody vegetation to severe disturbances, and the growth rates we found
   can serve as guidelines for long-term management regimes aimed at
   maintaining low woody cover and biomass in fuel breaks and buffer zones.}},

Abstract = {{The submontane belt of the eastern Alps is dominated by beech forests.
   However, on rocky and steep south-facing slopes, small vegetation
   mosaics have developed, which, to a certain degree, are similar to the
   Pannonian forest-steppes. In spite of their unique conservation
   importance and threatened status, they have received relatively little
   scientific attention. In this study we analyzed the spatial pattern of
   such mosaics. More specifically, our objective was to find out how
   canopy cover value influences the species composition of the herb layer.
   According to our results, canopy cover of Pinus sylvestris has a rather
   limited effect on the herb layer composition and species richness. Thus,
   in the studied canopy cover range (ca. 5-75\% canopy cover), most
   species occurred under all canopy cover grades. This is presumably a
   result of the canopy characteristics and branching pattern of P.
   sylvestris: it can be assumed that the physical conditions of the canopy
   and intercanopy patches are somewhat similar. This is in sharp contrast
   with the Pannonian forest-steppes dominated by Quercus pubescens. We
   conclude that, even though the cessation of traditional land-use may not
   result in a rapid change of the composition in eastern Austrian
   forest-steppes, every effort must be made to conserve these valuable
   habitats.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{156-166}},
Abstract = {{Cistus monspeliensis shrublands are strongly exposed to fire hazard and
   are rapidly expanding on oligotrophic soils as a consequence of the
   abandonment of silvopastoral activities. We hypothesised that nitrogen
   (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilisation could contribute to reduce Cistus
   cover and biomass and to direct the regeneration of the vegetation from
   seed bank after fire to grasslands able to prevent recurrent wildfires.
   Two experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of NP
   fertilisation on plant assemblage composition, diversity, grazing value,
   dry matter production and Cistus shrubland regeneration in (i)
   established shrublands, or (ii) recovering vegetation in burned areas.
   In the shrublands, NP fertilisation negatively affected Cistus cover,
   regeneration and biomass and significantly improved grazing value
   without significant effect on plant diversity. In burned areas, NP
   fertilisation significantly suppressed C. monspeliensis seedlings,
   increased the grazing value during the first 3 years since the last fire
   while it significantly reduced plant diversity. The increased grazing
   value following fertilisation in both burned and unburned areas is high
   enough to support silvopastoral activities. Soil fertilisation can be a
   key tool to support the conversion of shrublands in oligotrophic soils
   into productive grasslands, particularly when surrounding forests and
   urbanised areas, to reduce wildfire hazards through pastoral activities.}},

Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{39-48}},

Abstract = {{Nonnative pasture grasses established for agriculture and livestock
   husbandry have replaced countless acres of natural habitat in the last
   century of Florida history. Many endemic species, such as cutthroat
   grass (Coleataenia abscissa), are now endangered and may not return to
   areas until the dominant pasture grass has been removed. To determine
   the best strategy for native revegetation, we examined the effects of
   two soil preparations (tilling and no tilling) in pasture plots
   dominated by bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum) on the Archbold Reserve in
   south-central Florida. In preparation for the experiment, the No-Till
   and Till plots were first herbicided with glyphosate and burned to
   remove bahiagrass cover and expose the seed bank, then the Till plots
   were disked to a depth of 5-10 cm. Reference plots were left undisturbed
   to provide a pre-restoration baseline. The pre-tilling herbicide
   application and burn reduced bahiagrass cover in experimental plots to
   an average of 24\% compared to 80\% in reference plots. In the first
   year following tilling, overall plant community composition differed
   between tillage treatments, with 52 and 38 plant taxa found in the
   No-Till and Till plots, respectively, compared to only 14 in the
   reference plots. Importantly, native species richness was significantly
   higher in the No-Till treatment, and tilling resulted in minimal
   reduction of cover of bahiagrass and other exotic grasses. Seedling
   species composition differed among experimental blocks, suggesting soil
   moisture or other local abiotic conditions may significantly influence
   seedling establishment and restoration outcomes regardless of mechanical
   soil preparations.}},

Title = {{Plant community assembly in Mediterranean grasslands: understanding the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{149-159}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsHow does grazing affect taxonomic diversity and functional
   structure of Mediterranean grassland communities? How do spatial and
   inter-annual variations in water availability, as a proxy for
   productivity, modulate grazing effects? Are shifts in taxonomic
   diversity systematically mirrored by analogous changes in functional
   diversity along these gradients?
   LocationMediterranean grasslands in central Spain.
   MethodsWe surveyed grassland plant communities in 3yrs with contrasting
   mean annual rainfall (total n=441 plots). Grazing gradients were
   quantified by periodic visual observation. DEM and annual rainfall data
   were used to quantify water availability. We examined the effects of
   grazing and spatio-temporal water availability on taxonomic diversity
   (TD; species richness), functional diversity (FD; Rao's Q) and community
   mean trait values (CMT) for three key plant traits (specific leaf area
   -SLA-, height and seed mass). Functional redundancy was discussed
   through the relationship between TD and FD trends.
   ResultsThe results for TD, FD and CMT showed that environmental
   filtering determined the differences between plots with different
   grazing and water availability conditions. In contrast to seed mass FD,
   FD of vegetative traits (height and SLA) was highly decoupled from TD as
   a result of both spatial and inter-annual variations in water
   availability. Grazing reduced TD and functional redundancy only in the
   wettest year (i.e. in the absence of drought filtering), but selected
   for species with grazing tolerance and grazing avoidance strategies
   (reflected by high SLA CMT and low height CMT, respectively) in all
   water availability conditions.
   ConclusionsOur results highlight the importance of grazing and both
   spatial and temporal variation in water availability as drivers of the
   assembly of Mediterranean grassland communities. The complex and
   decoupled responses that we found confirm that future studies should
   combine the use of different analytical methods to elucidate the
   multiple facets of community change, along with an optimal
   characterization of livestock pressure and its potential interactions
   with habitat productivity.}},

   mediated by soil acidification in an alpine meadow}},
Journal = {{PEDOBIOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Abstract = {{Clipping is one of the most important land-use practices in grassland
   ecosystems, yet the extent of clipping effect on ecosystem carbon (C)
   cycles depends on its interaction with nitrogen (N) deposition in future
   global climate change scenario, especially in the N-limited alpine
   meadow ecosystem. We conducted a field N addition (40 kg N ha(-1)
   yr(-1)) and clipping experiment in an alpine meadow on the northern
   Tibet Plateau to investigate the effects of exogenous N input and
   clipping on ecosystem (Re) and soil respiration (Rs). Generally, N
   enrichment enhanced Re, Rs and aboveground biomass (AGB) in the second
   year of the experiment, but the extent of the enhancements decreased
   from the third year of the experiment. Clipping didn't affect Re, Rs and
   AGB relative to the control, while clipping and N addition significantly
   increased belowground biomass. Soil inorganic N increased, while soil pH
   decreased with the year of N additions. Significant positive
   correlations of aboveground biomass with Re and Rs suggest the increase
   of plant photosynthetic C fixation under N addition is a key force in
   driving thus ecosystem CO2 efflux. However, the positive correlation
   between soil pH and aboveground biomass indicated soil acidification
   could be one of important factors decelerating the positive responses of
   plant growth to soil N availability increase. All the results suggest
   soil acidification due to N addition influenced the effects of N
   enrichment and clipping on ecosystem CO2 efflux through modulating plant
   growth and photosynthetic C allocation. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Environmental cueing that restricts seed germination to times and places
   where mortality risk is relatively low may have considerable selective
   advantage. The predictive power of lab germination responses for field
   regeneration behaviour is rarely tested. We screened 11 alpine grassland
   forbs for germination behaviour predictive of microsite and seasonal
   selectivity, and seed carry-over across years. The predictions were
   tested in a field experiment. Germination in the lab ranged from 0.05\%
   to 67.9\%, and was affected by light (5 species), temperature (6
   species), fluctuating temperatures (4 species), moist chilling prior to
   germination (cold-stratification) (6 species), and dormancy-breaking by
   means of gibberellic acid (8 species). Seedling emergence in the field
   varied from 0.1\% to 14.1\%, and increased in low-competition microsites
   (bare-ground gaps and cut vegetation; 7 species), and showed seasonal
   timing (1 species in autumn and 1 species in spring), and seed
   carry-over across years (7 species). Lab germination responses
   successfully predicted microsite selectivity in the field and to some
   extent seed carry-over across years but not seasonal timing of
   germination. Gap-detecting species were generally small-seeded,
   low-growing, and found in unproductive habitats. Larger-seeded species
   germinated in all of the microsites but experienced increased mortality
   in high-competition microsites. Seed carry-over across years was lower
   for alpine specialists than for more widely-distributed species.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing attention has been paid to the relationship between
   biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) because of the rapid
   increase in species loss. However, over the past 20 years, most BEF
   studies only focused on the effect of species diversity on one or a few
   ecosystem functions, and only a few studies focused on ecosystem
   multifunctionality (i.e., the simultaneous provision of several
   ecosystem functions). Grassland ecosystems have important economic,
   environmental, and esthetic value; thus, this study focused on the
   heterogeneous microcommunities in grasslands under three management
   modes. The multifunctionality index (M-index) was assessed at community
   and microcommunity scales, and the relationship between species
   diversity and multifunctionality was investigated. The communities were
   found to be respectively composed of one, three, and six
   microcommunities in grazing, clipping, and enclosure management, based
   on a two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN) and detrended
   correspondence analysis (DCA) for community structure. Biodiversity and
   soil indicators showed an apparent degradation of the grazing community,
   which had the worst M-index. Clipping and enclosure communities showed
   no significant difference in biodiversity indices, soil variables, and
   M-index; however, these indices were clearly different among
   microcommunities. Therefore, the microcommunity scale may be suitable to
   investigate the relationship between vegetation and multifunctionality
   in seminatural grassland ecosystems. Dominant species richness had more
   explanatory power for ecosystem multifunctionality than subdominant
   species richness, rare species richness, and the number of all species.
   Therefore, it is important to distinguish the role and rank of different
   species in the species richness-multifunctionality model; otherwise, the
   model might include redundant and unclear information. Communities with
   more codominant species whose distribution is also even might have
   better multifunctionality.}},

Abstract = {{Many tropical forests worldwide are protected due to their sacredness to
   religious communities. In the south Gondar region of Ethiopia, most of
   the remaining native forests are tiny fragments (5.42 ha +/- 0.34)
   surrounded by pasture and agriculture that are protected because they
   encompass churches of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido Church (EOTC). A
   small number of communities have erected stone walls around the
   perimeter of the forests to demarcate the boundary, and/or protect the
   interior of the forest. We evaluated the effectiveness of these walls at
   protecting ecological conditions by examining tree and seedling
   communities among sacred forests with and without walls in Montane and
   Upper Montane sites. We found the wall to be an effective conservation
   tool as regeneration potential was higher in forests with a wall. The
   density and species richness of seedlings were significantly higher in
   forests with a wall and these effects were more pronounced in Upper
   Montane forests. Forests with a wall also had seedlings of many native
   tree species that were not found in forests without walls. As expected,
   there were few differences in tree communities in forests with and
   without a wall. Although rare on the landscape, the presence of a stone
   wall around these forests was effective at protecting the seedling
   community because it likely reduced access to the forests by grazers and
   directed human visitors to trails. The use of a stone wall may protect
   seedling communities in other sacred forest fragments, particularly for
   those that are small, isolated, surrounded by agriculture, and have a
   depleted seed bank.}},

Abstract = {{Maintenance of biodiversity in tropical agrarian landscapes is
   challenging in the face of anthropomorphic simplification of habitats.
   As part of an experiment testing influences of planting treatment on
   tree recruitment in southern Mexico, counts of bird species were made
   over 10 years in twenty-four 30x30-m fenced plots in over-grazed
   pasture. Plots were planted with native tree species or left as
   unplanted controls in 2006. Annual censuses of birds in the plots from
   2007-2016 indicated statistically significant increases in the number of
   fruit-eating species and individuals as vegetation matured, but
   increases in non-frugivorous species and individuals over the decade
   were not significant. Among four species of planted animal-dispersed
   trees that bore fruit during this time, Cecropia obtusifolia
   consistently produced substantial crops after 2009. In 2015, all 53
   planted or passively recruited female trees of mature size of this
   species bore fruit. The summed body masses of fruit-eating birds in each
   of 24 plots were significantly correlated with rank order of available
   fruit per plot. Differential use of habitat patches in an agrarian
   landscape suggested substantial value to frugivores, but less to
   non-frugivorous birds than expected.}},

Abstract = {{Amphibians are a disproportionately threatened group of vertebrates, the
   status of which in Sub-Saharan Africa is still uncertain, with
   heterogeneous fauna punctuated by mountains. Mount Oku, Cameroon is one
   such mountain, which holds many endemic and restricted-range species.
   The history of amphibian research on Mt Oku, current knowledge on
   biogeography and conservation biology is reviewed, including recent
   findings. This updated inventory adds 25 further species, with 50
   species of amphibian so far recorded to the Oku Massif (c. 900 to 3,011
   m). This includes 5 endemic to Mt Oku, 7 endemic to the Bamenda
   Highlands, 18 restricted to the highlands of Cameroon and Nigeria, and
   20 with broader ranges across Africa. This includes a new mountain
   locality for the Critically Endangered Leptodactylodon axillaris. Among
   others, the first record of Phrynobatrachus schioetzi and Ptychadena
   taenioscelis from Cameroon are presented. The uncertainty of habitat
   affinities and elevational ranges are discussed. The proportion of
   threatened species on Mt Oku is 44.2\%, but projected to increase to
   47.9\% due to new species descriptions and recent dramatic declines. The
   natural habitats of Mt Oku are irreplaceable refuges for its endemic and
   restricted-range amphibian populations under severe pressure elsewhere
   in their range. Threats to this important amphibian fauna are
   increasing, including agricultural encroachment, expanding aquaculture,
   livestock grazing, pollution, invasive species, forest loss and
   degradation. Past, present and desired conservation interventions to
   address these threats are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Domesticated landscapes are formed by complex social and ecological
   interactions. We study present-day remnants of species-rich hay meadows
   and pastures in Scandinavia, with historical roots in former infield
   systems', initially developed during the first centuries AD and
   maintained until the modernisation of agriculture during the nineteenth
   and twentieth centuries. Infield systems include infields, enclosed
   areas near farms incorporating hay meadows and crop fields, and
   surrounding outlying land used mainly for grazing. We interpret the
   development of Scandinavian infield systems and their relationship to
   vegetation and human culture using concepts of niche construction and
   entanglement. A key issue revolves around spatio-temporal stabilisation
   of managed grasslands, in turn related to a complex of interactions
   between cultural development (e.g. perceptions of land ownership and
   management practices) and ecological patterns (e.g. species richness).
   We propose that niche construction and entanglement are useful concepts
   bridging studies in social history and ecology, and for developing

Abstract = {{Input and decomposition of plant-derived organic matter are key
   processes of the C and N cycling in the post-agricultural succession.
   This study compared three treatments in order to better understand the
   contribution of plant-derived organic matter to the C and N levels of
   the ecosystem in abandoned agrosystems. Mowing without plant residue
   removal can increase the addition of fresh plant residue and prevented
   the succession to Solidago altissima. In the fifth year of
   experimentation, the significantly higher floor litter C in the no
   mowing lead to a higher total C accumulation than that in the mowing
   treatments. Mowing reduced the floor litter C by 40\% and 13\%, in the
   third to fifth year of experimentation, respectively. Additionally, it
   rapidly changed the vegetation coverage, and decreased the total C in
   the early stages of post-agricultural succession. Therefore, mowing was
   less effective in retaining the C pool due to the addition of fresh
   plant residue and its decomposition, whereas no mowing can increase the
   addition of plant residue, leading to be relatively high total N.
   However, the N input might be insufficient to compensate for the mineral
   soil-N reduction in the early stages of post-agricultural succession.

Title = {{Habitat Configuration Alters Herbivory across the Tropical Seascape}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{There exists increasing evidence that top-down ecological processes,
   such as herbivory are key in controlling marine ecosystems and their
   community structure. Herbivory has the potential to be altered by
   numerous environmental and ecological factors that operate at a variety
   of temporal and spatial scales, one such spatial factor is the influence
   of the marine landscape. We know little about how ecological processes,
   such as herbivory change throughout the marine landscape and how the
   effects of these processes cascade. This is because most landscape scale
   studies observe species richness and abundance patterns. In terrestrial
   systems the landscape is well documented to influence ecological
   processes, but empirical evidence of this is limited in marine systems.
   In tropical seagrass meadows direct herbivory by parrotfish can be
   readily observed due to the clear hemispherical bite marks they leave on
   the seagrass. As with herbivory in other systems, this leaf consumption
   is thought to assist with leaf turnover, positively influencing leaf
   growth. Changes in its rate and extent are therefore likely to influence
   the characteristics of the plant. The faunal communities of seagrass
   meadows alter with respect to changes in the landscape, particularly
   with respect to connectivity to adjacent habitats. It might therefore be
   expected that a key ecological process, such as herbivory will change
   with respect to habitat configuration and have cascading impacts upon
   the status of the seagrass. In the present study we examined indirect
   evidence of parrotfish grazing throughout the marine landscape and
   assessed this relative to plant condition. Seagrasses in locations of
   close proximity to mangroves were found to have double the amount of
   parrotfish grazing than sites away from mangroves. Evidence of herbivory
   was also found to be strongly and significantly negatively correlated to
   the abundance of plant attached epicover. The decreased epicover in the
   presence of elevated herbivory suggests increased leaf turnover. These
   results indicate that seagrass may have higher levels of ecosystem
   resilience in the presence of mangroves. Our research highlights how
   ecological processes can change throughout the marine landscape with
   cascade impacts on the resilience of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Sweden aims to increase the proportion of renewable energy sources,
   ultimately to be able to phase out fossil fuels. To achieve this, new
   energy sources need to be explored. In this multi-disciplinary article,
   we examine the technical, economical, ecological and legal possibilities
   to commercially and sustainably harvest brushwood for bioenergy, while
   simultaneously gaining positive environmental effects, both for
   biological diversity, the cultural heritage, and the climate.
   The Swedish open landscape is becoming covered with secondary brushwood
   regrowth through natural succession, except where it is kept open.
   Brushwood is spreading along roads, railway lines, edge zones, in power
   line corridors, abandoned semi-natural grasslands, nature reserves, and
   in marginal land in urban areas. Such brushwood consists of saplings,
   bushes and young trees of a range of deciduous plant species, e.g.
   birch, aspen, alder and goat willow, sometimes mixed with conifers,
   often forming dense thickets.
   Such secondary brushwood regrowth could be systematically utilised as a
   new source of renewable bioenergy. Commercial brushwood harvesting in
   Sweden may contribute 26 PJ of energy annually, which may be a small but
   significant contribution, considering the favourable energy ratio (E-r =
   28), indicating that large emission reductions can be achieved, if
   fossil fuels are replaced. Growing brushwood does not require
   fertilizers or pesticides, soil tillage or crop management, and it does
   not compete with any other potential land use. Many brushwood habitats
   are already being managed to clear brushwood, for other purposes,
   minimizing the added harvesting cost.
   Apart from providing bioenergy, it has also been suggested that
   brushwood harvesting would benefit biological diversity. A large number
   of nationally redlisted species are dependent on the active management
   of open habitats, including semi-natural grasslands, and man-made
   habitats such as road verges and power line corridors.
   Our literature review shows that brushwood harvesting could benefit both
   biological diversity and the cultural heritage, and contribute to the
   management of the open cultural landscape. There are however certain
   limitations. Brushwood harvesting would favour a certain set of species,
   including many redlisted, but it may also threaten another set of
   species, especially species associated with early successional stages of
   forest regeneration, as well as forest edge species, depending on how
   and where it is applied. Harvesting may be affected by legislation
   imposing limitations regarding habitats of particular importance for
   biodiversity. The environmental and legal constraints would probably
   reduce the profitability of brushwood harvesting in certain areas, as
   well as the annual production of bioenergy. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Land-use intensification causes multitrophic homogenization of grassland
   communities}},

Abstract = {{Land-use intensification is a major driver of biodiversity loss(1,2).
   Alongside reductions in local species diversity, biotic homogenization
   at larger spatial scales is of great concern for conservation. Biotic
   homogenization means a decrease in beta-diversity (the compositional
   dissimilarity between sites). Most studies have investigated losses in
   local (alpha)-diversity(1,3) and neglected biodiversity loss at larger
   spatial scales. Studies addressing beta-diversity have focused on single
   or a few organism groups (for example, ref. 4), and it is thus unknown
   whether land-use intensification homogenizes communities at different
   trophic levels, above-and belowground. Here we show that even moderate
   increases in local land-use intensity (LUI) cause biotic homogenization
   across microbial, plant and animal groups, both above- and belowground,
   and that this is largely independent of changes in alpha-diversity. We
   analysed a unique grassland biodiversity dataset, with abundances of
   more than 4,000 species belonging to 12 trophic groups. LUI, and, in
   particular, high mowing intensity, had consistent effects on
   beta-diversity across groups, causing a homogenization of soil
   microbial, fungal pathogen, plant and arthropod communities. These
   effects were nonlinear and the strongest declines in beta-diversity
   occurred in the transition from extensively managed to intermediate
   intensity grassland. LUI tended to reduce local alpha-diversity in
   aboveground groups, whereas the alpha-diversity increased in belowground
   groups. Correlations between the alpha-diversity of different groups,
   particularly between plants and their consumers, became weaker at high
   LUI. This suggests a loss of specialist species and is further evidence
   for biotic homogenization. The consistently negative effects of LUI on
   landscape-scale biodiversity underscore the high value of extensively
   managed grasslands for conserving multitrophic biodiversity and
   ecosystem service provision. Indeed, biotic homogenization rather than
   local diversity loss could prove to be the most substantial consequence
   of land-use intensification.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial properties may help to provide an integrated view of changes
   in soil functioning associated with soil management or soil status. The
   fatty acid profiles of membrane phospholipids (PLFA) can give the
   composition of ecophysiological groups of soil microbial communities,
   while catabolic response profiles (CRP) estimate the heterotrophic
   functional diversity in soils, both relevant to the understanding of the
   role of micro-organisms in the functioning of the soil. The objectives
   of this study were (i) to evaluate the CRP and PLFA as microbial tools
   to characterize changes in soil functioning and (ii) clarify the
   relation among these microbial measurements, with other physical,
   chemical and biochemical soil properties. We compare the same soil
   subjected to different managements and degrees of erosion. An
   undisturbed soil (UN), an old pasture soil (OP) and soils under
   continuous cultivation (NT) with four different depth of A horizon: 25
   cm (NT 25), 23 cm (NT 23), 19 cm (NT 19) and 14 cm (NT 14) were tested.
   Substrate-induced respiration of most substrates diminished when
   cropping pressure increased (UN > OP > NT), and soil catabolic evenness,
   as a diversity index, decreased by increasing production pressure and
   soil erosion. The correlation found among most of the measured physical,
   chemical and biochemical soil properties with the catabolic evenness
   showed the potential of this measurement to provide an integrated view
   of soil functioning. The PLFA analysis showed that the composition of
   microbial community denoting a partial recovery after 10 yr under grazed
   grassland. The stress indicators showed that farming practices increased
   microbial stress with the highest values found in the most eroded soils.}},

Abstract = {{The acceleration of grassland loss on the global scale has been reported
   in many studies, which is often attributed to the combination of land
   use change and increased variability of climatic processes. Extensive
   steppe national parks serve as an ideal study site for grassland
   conservation, especially wilderness areas where the natural effects of
   grazing on wildlife can still be tracked. In our study we aim to
   investigate the effects of habitat structure, grazing type and intensity
   as well as climatic variables on species abundance, species richness and
   abundance of functional groups of ground-breeding bird species in the
   largest compact alkali grassland area of central Europe. We applied the
   information theoretic approach estimating the importance of ecological
   predictors according models of substantial support. The main result of
   our study shows that ground-breeding bird communities in steppe areas
   exhibit highly species-specific responses to the species of grazers,
   grazing intensity, habitat composition and climatic predictors. Across
   the most supported models, species-specific habitat composition values
   were the most supported predictors. Our findings show that although the
   response of ground-breeding birds to vegetation, grazing and climatic
   predictors is highly species-specific, consistent patterns of
   responsiveness to grazing and climatic patterns emerge, which calls for
   long-term studies on the combined effects of climatic variability and
   management of grazing systems.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological trade-offs are fundamental to theory in community ecology;
   critical for understanding species coexistence in diverse plant
   communities, as well as the evolution of diverse life-history
   strategies. Invasions by exotic species can provide insights into the
   importance of trade-offs in community assembly, because the ecological
   strategies of invading species often differ from those present in the
   native species pool. Exotic annual species have invaded many
   Mediterranean-climate areas around the globe, and often germinate and
   emerge earlier in the growing season than native species. Early-season
   growth can enable exotic annual species to preempt space and resources,
   competitively suppressing later-emerging native species; however,
   early-emerging individuals may also be more apparent to herbivores. This
   suggests a potential trade-off between seasonal phenology and
   susceptibility to herbivory. To evaluate this hypothesis, we monitored
   the emergence and growth of 12 focal species (six each native and
   exotic) in monoculture and polyculture, while experimentally excluding
   generalist herbivores both early and later in the growing season.
   Consistent with past studies, the exotic species emerged earlier than
   native species. Regardless of species origin, earlier-emerging species
   achieved greater biomass by the end of the experiment, but were more
   negatively impacted by herbivory, particularly in the early part of the
   growing season. This greater impact of early-season herbivory on
   early-active species led to a reduction in the competitive advantage of
   exotic species growing in polyculture, and improved the performance of
   later-emerging natives. Such a trade-off between early growth and
   susceptibility to herbivores could be an important force in community
   assembly in seasonal herbaceous-dominated ecosystems. These results also
   show how herbivore exclusion favors early-active exotic species in this
   system, with important implications for management in many areas invaded
   by early-active exotic species.}},

Abstract = {{Successful forest restoration in tropical environments is limited by the
   paucity of studies on the initial establishment and early survival
   requirements of seedlings of most native tropical tree species under
   disturbed conditions. Here, we evaluated the initial growth responses
   and the regeneration potential of seedlings of five tree species native
   to Costa Rica (Hasseltia floribunda, Inga densiflora, Persea americana,
   Tapirira mexicana and Trichilia pittieri). Seedlings were grown in
   secondary forests and adjacent open pastures under contrasting
   conditions of light availability. We quantified seedling growth,
   survival and herbivory from August 2010 to August 2011 on a monthly
   basis, and measured differences in leaf mass per area (LMA) at the end
   of the experiment. We found significant variation in growth responses
   between the understory of secondary forests and pastures. Growth in
   height was highest in pastures across all species, with I. densiflora,
   P. americana and T. mexicana showing the most striking differences. In
   contrast, H. floribunda and T. pittieri did not show differences in
   diameter growth between environments. Except for T. mexicana, herbivory
   increased throughout the experiment in all the species. Herbivory
   increased faster in pastures for H. floribunda and T. pittieri and
   showed higher rates in the forest understory for 1, densiflora and P
   americana. Seedling survival showed significant differences for all
   species across environments. Survival of H. floribunda and I. densiflora
   was higher in secondary forests, whereas the other species showed higher
   survival in pastures. LMA showed higher values in the pastures across
   all species, showing that individuals exposed to high light conditions
   had great photosynthetic rate and great leaf construction capacity. Due
   to their rapid growth and high survival, I. densiflora and T. mexicana
   showed great potential to restore abandoned pastures and secondary
   forests. Increasing our knowledge on the response of seedlings under
   disturbed conditions in tropical ecosystems is critical for improving
   the restoration of altered environments by matching the ecological
   amplitude of native species with specific environmental conditions.}},

Title = {{Biodiversity and ecological long-term plots in Southern Patagonia to

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Historically, interactions and trends between biodiversity, ecosystem
   function (EF) and land use practices in southern Patagonia (Argentina)
   have been largely undocumented and poorly understood. Since 2002, 1214
   permanent and semi-permanent plots within the PEBANPA Network have
   enabled researchers to monitor and assess functions and trends among
   vegetation parameters, biodiversity, forest dynamics, soil
   physicochemical characteristics, and land use management. The objectives
   of this manuscript are to communicate the role and rationale of the
   PEBANPA Network, summarize examples of the main results found within the
   network and provide guidance to decision makers with respect to
   advancing sustainable land management in southern Patagonia. As
   examples, rangeland health indices, seedling and sapling regeneration
   under different timber managed forests, litterfall and seeds production
   under silvopastoral use, and soil carbon content impacted by livestock
   grazing have all been assessed. Vegetation and environmental variables
   including soil respiration, soil water infiltration, soil water
   retention capacity, soil erosion, and litter cover were measured under
   different grazing intensities. Livestock and forestry production have
   caused changes in the original floristic patterns, with several areas
   experiencing desertification. Heavy stocking rates have caused the
   greatest impacts on grassland soil carbon (C) loss as a consequence of
   soil erosion. We were able to conclude that low medium grazing
   intensities yield the most positive impacts for biodiversity and soil
   physicochemical characteristics. Studies regarding levels of seedling
   and sapling regeneration post-harvest of timber further supported the
   importance of long-term monitoring due to the strongest evidence of
   interactions occurring 20 to 30 years after harvest. Distribution
   patterns of vascular plants and epigaeic coleopterons diversity revealed
   statistically significant differences among geographical zones and
   dominant vegetation types. The PEBANPA Network helps southern Patagonia
   address the challenges of unsustainable land management and climate
   change through monitoring ecosystem function and services. Long-term
   monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem function help decision makers
   better understand the impacts of land use practices, develop
   well-informed policies and secure present and future human well-being.

Abstract = {{As the main form of land use and human disturbance of grassland,
   livestock grazing has great influences on the soil resources and plant
   communities. This study observed the variation of soil properties and
   community characteristics of four treatments of different grazing
   intensity (no grazing, UG; light grazing, LG; moderate grazing, MG; and
   heavy grazing, HG) in an alpine meadow of Sichuan Province on the
   northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that
   grazing increased the pH, soil bulk density (BD), and contents of total
   carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN), and the BD increased while the
   others decreased with the grazing intensity. At the community level,
   with the increase of the grazing intensity, the vegetation coverage (R-2
   = 0.61, P < 0.001), mean height of community (R-2 = 0.37, P < 0.001),
   aboveground biomass (R-2 = 0.54, P < 0.001), litter biomass (R-2 = 0.84,
   P < 0.001), and percentage of aboveground biomass of palatable grasses
   to total biomass (R-2 = 0.74, P < 0.001) significantly decreased, while
   the belowground biomass (R-2 = 0.72, P < 0.001) and the root/shoot (R/S)
   ratio (R-2 = 0.65, P < 0.001) increased. The species richness was the
   greatest at LG and the total biomass at UG. With grazing, the dominant
   species of the plant community shifted from palatable grasses (Gramineae
   and Cyperaceae) to unpalatable grasses (Compositae and Ranunculaceae).
   Based on the results, LG may be the optimal grassland management mode to
   be used in the long time in the alpine meadow of the Tibetan Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{Silvopastoral systems in Nothofagus antarctica (ire) forest have become
   an economical, ecological and productive alternative in Patagonia.
   Southern Patagonia's experience over the past 12 years with
   silvopastoral systems is reviewed. The productivity and nutritive value
   (crude protein content and dry matter digestibility) of the understorey
   grassland were dependent on the interaction of environmental (mainly
   soil water availability and light intensity) and management factors
   under the trees and in turn determined animal performance. A method
   developed for carrying capacity estimation at the paddock level was
   based on the potential aboveground net primary production, and values
   ranged from 85 to 2200 kg DM ha(-1) year(-1). Planned thinning in
   secondary forest stands provides wood production and also improves the
   undestorey DM production by increasing incoming radiation. Within a
   management plan, a stand's water stress conditions as well as the use of
   Reineke's stand density index are proposed to assist in determining
   thinning intensities. Livestock production is the main annual income of
   silvopastoral systems where cattle and mixed livestock production
   (cattle + sheep) is the main activity. Animal performance at the whole
   farm scale is presented by comparing traditional extensive grazing
   management with an adaptive silvopastoral management that included
   strategic separation in homogeneous areas (grass steppe, forest and
   riparian meadows), stocking rate adjustment to grassland net primary
   production and the protection of regeneration from herbivores browsing.
   Data from litter decomposition, nutrient cycling and carbon storage
   studies also are presented. Finally, aspects related to the criteria and
   indicators to assess ire forest's sustainability under silvopastoral use
   along with biodiversity conservation issues are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural pastures have rich plant and animal communities of high
   conservation value which depend on extensive management. As the area of
   such land decreases, abandoned semi-natural grasslands have been
   restored to re-establish biodiversity. Restoration schemes, which
   include thinning of woody plants and reintroduction of grazing, are
   mainly designed according to the responses of well-studied groups (such
   as vascular plants and birds). Weevils (Curculionidae) are a very
   diverse phytophagous beetle family. Here, we evaluated the restoration
   success of pastures for weevils (Curculionidae), by comparing their
   species diversity in abandoned, restored, and continuously grazed
   semi-natural pastures on 24 sites in central Sweden. Weevils were
   sampled by sweep-netting. We recorded 3019 weevil individuals belonging
   to 104 species. There was no statistically significant difference in
   species numbers between the pasture management treatments. However,
   weevil species composition of abandoned pastures differed from those in
   restored and continuously managed pastures, but there was no significant
   difference in community composition between restored and continuously
   grazed pastures. The abandoned sites tended to be dominated by
   polyphagous species, whereas the grazed sites contained more monophagous
   and oligophagous species. The number of weevil species was positively
   related to understory vegetation height and connectivity to other
   semi-natural grasslands and negatively related to the cover of trees and
   shrubs in the pastures. We conclude that restoration of abandoned
   semi-natural pastures is a good approach to restore weevil communities.
   To maintain a species rich weevil community, pastures should be managed
   to be relatively open, but still have patches of tall field-layer
   vegetation. Restoration and conservation measures should primarily be
   targeted on regions and landscapes where a high proportion of
   semi-natural grassland still remains.}},

Abstract = {{Many rangelands of the world are fire dependent and display a strong
   interaction between fire and grazing on animal behavior, productivity
   and ecosystem processes. The application of this fire-grazing
   interaction as patch-burn grazing (PBG) has recently been promoted in
   North America to conserve biodiversity and as an alternative for
   livestock management in fire-prone ecosystems to enhance forage quality
   and other production benefits. PBG is functionally applied by burning
   spatially and temporally discrete patches to allow livestock to choose
   where and when to graze. However, considering that the primary intent of
   PBG in fire-dependent ecosystems has been for the conservation of
   biodiversity, we synthesized the peer-reviewed literature to assess PBG
   as an alternative strategy for livestock management in fire-prone
   ecosystems. We reviewed the literature to assess PBG as an alternative
   livestock management approach to optimize animal production and conserve
   biodiversity in fire-prone ecosystems. We reviewed the results of 83
   studies that focused on two main areas: (1) livestock production and
   inputs and (2) maintaining or improving ecosystem functioning and
   biodiversity to support sustainable livestock production. PBG can
   optimize cattle production by offsetting input costs such as
   supplemental feed, insecticides, herbicides, mechanical brush control,
   veterinary costs and cross-fencing. PBG can also maintain native
   herbaceous plant communities that are the resource base for cattle
   grazing enterprises by reducing woody plant encroachment, stimulating
   above- and below-ground biomass of native perennial grasses, enhancing
   nutrient cycling and optimizing plant diversity. PBG creates a habitat
   mosaic critical for many trophic levels of wildlife, particularly
   grassland birds, which are currently in decline. Further research is
   needed to clarify the potential environmental gradients defining
   applicability of PBG, economic outcomes of PBG, potential
   gastro-intestinal parasite control with PBG and other metrics of animal
   production. Overall, PBG is a viable management approach to improve
   productivity and biodiversity in fire-regulated grassland ecosystems in
   a manner supported by both fire and grazing disturbances. This is
   especially true when these communities have other organisms that depend
   on periodic disturbance and interaction with large animal grazing and is
   supported by ample empirical research.}},

Title = {{Effects of biodiversity strengthen over time as ecosystem functioning
   declines at low and increases at high biodiversity}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Human-caused declines in biodiversity have stimulated intensive research
   on the consequences of biodiversity loss for ecosystem services and
   policy initiatives to preserve the functioning of ecosystems. Short-term
   biodiversity experiments have documented positive effects of plant
   species richness on many ecosystem functions, and longer-term studies
   indicate, for some ecosystem functions, that biodiversity effects can
   become stronger over time. Theoretically, a biodiversity effect can
   strengthen over time by an increasing performance of high-diversity
   communities, by a decreasing performance of low-diversity communities,
   or a combination of both processes. Which of these two mechanisms
   prevail, and whether the increase in the biodiversity effect over time
   is a general property of many functions remains currently unclear. These
   questions are an important knowledge gap as a continuing decline in the
   performance of low-diversity communities would indicate an
   ecosystem-service debt resulting from delayed effects of species loss on
   ecosystem functioning. Conversely, an increased performance of
   high-diversity communities over time would indicate that the benefits of
   biodiversity are generally underestimated in short-term studies.
   Analyzing 50 ecosystem variables over 11 years in the world's largest
   grassland biodiversity experiment, we show that overall plant diversity
   effects strengthened over time. Strengthening biodiversity effects were
   independent of the considered compartment (above- or belowground),
   organizational level (ecosystem variables associated with the abiotic
   habitat, primary producers, or higher trophic levels such as herbivores
   and pollinators), and variable type (measurements of pools or rates). We
   found evidence that biodiversity effects strengthened because of both a
   progressive decrease in functioning in species-poor and a progressive
   increase in functioning in species-rich communities. Our findings
   provide evidence that negative feedback effects at low biodiversity are
   as important for biodiversity effects as complementarity among species
   at high biodiversity. Finally, our results indicate that a current loss
   of species will result in a future impairment of ecosystem functioning,
   potentially decades beyond the moment of species extinction.}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   Alien species are commonly considered as harmful weeds capable of
   decreasing native biodiversity and threatening ecosystems. Despite this
   assumption, little is known about the long-term patterns of the
   native-alien relationships associated with human disturbed managed
   landscapes. This study aims to elucidate the community dynamics
   associated with a successional gradient in Chilean Mediterranean
   grasslands, considering both native and alien species.
   Methods
   Species richness (natives and aliens separately) and life-form (annuals
   and perennials) were recorded in four Chilean post-agricultural grazed
   grasslands each covering a broad successional gradient (from 1 to 40
   years since crop abandonment). A detrended correspondence analysis
   (DCA), mixed model effects analyses and correlation tests were conducted
   to assess how this temporal gradient influenced natives and aliens
   through community dynamics.
   Important Findings
   Our results show different life-form patterns between natives and aliens
   over time. Aliens were mainly represented by annuals (especially
   ruderals and weeds), which were established at the beginning of
   succession. Annual aliens also predominated at mid-successional stages,
   but in old grasslands native species were slightly more representative
   than alien ones within the community. In the late successional states,
   positive or no correlations at all between alien and native species
   richness suggested the absence of competition between both species
   groups, as a result of different strategies in occupation of the space.
   Community dynamics over time constitute a net gain in biodiversity,
   increasing natives and maintaining a general alien pool, allowing the
   coexistence of both. Biotic interactions including facilitation and/or
   tolerance processes might be occurring in Chilean post-agricultural
   grasslands, a fact that contradicts the accepted idea of the alien
   species as contenders.}},

Abstract = {{The variety of local animal sounds characterizes a landscape. We used
   ecoacoustics to noninvasively assess the species richness of various
   biotopes typical of an ecofriendly forest plantation with diverse
   ecological gradients and both nonnative and indigenous vegetation. The
   reference area was an adjacent large World Heritage Site protected area
   (PA). All sites were in a global biodiversity hotspot. Our results
   showed how taxa segregated into various biotopes. We identified 65
   singing species, including birds, frogs, crickets, and katydids. Large,
   natural, protected grassland sites in the PA had the highest mean
   acoustic diversity (14.1 species/site). Areas covered in nonnative
   timber or grass species were devoid of acoustic species. Sites grazed by
   native and domestic megaherbivores were fairly rich (5.1) in acoustic
   species but none were unique to this habitat type, where acoustic
   diversity was greater than in intensively managed grassland sites
   (0.04). Natural vegetation patches inside the plantation mosaic
   supported high mean acoustic diversity (indigenous forests 7.6,
   grasslands 8.0, wetlands 9.1), which increased as plant heterogeneity
   and patch size increased. Indigenous forest patches within the
   plantation mosaic contained a highly characteristic acoustic species
   assemblage, emphasizing their complementary contribution to local
   biodiversity. Overall, acoustic signals determined spatial biodiversity
   patterns and can be a useful tool for guiding conservation.}},

   abandonment. However, there have been few case studies of grazing
   management in very anthropized ecosystems, such as the new ecosystems
   created by urban or industrial conversions. In Southern France, the Rhne
   channeling for navigation and electricity production generated in the
   1950s the construction of thousands of hectares of dams and dykes which
   were colonized naturally by diverse plant communities. Yet shrub
   encroachment and the consequent recourse to mechanical cutting to
   facilitate control and maintenance, raise the question of how best to
   maintain and manage these new habitats. Consequently, since 1999,
   different low-intensity grazing management systems using rustic breeds
   of cattle, horses and goats have been tested on a protected reserve of
   1454 ha located in the lower part of the Rhne river. Extensive grazing,
   more than cutting or no management, positively modified vegetation
   heterogeneity (beta-diversity), the target open grassland species, but
   not plant species richness (alpha-diversity). However, the current
   monitoring shows that these benefits of grazing will be confirmed only
   if low-intensity grazing systems are sustained and if new adaptations
   can be also made, such as the use of mixed stocking and the
   establishment of multiyear contracts with breeders.}},

Abstract = {{The short life span, irregular forage production and susceptibility to
   weed colonization of cool-season grass-legume pastures are serious
   problems in grazing dairy systems in warm-temperate regions. The
   inclusion of warm-season species has the potential to mitigate these
   problems. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the inclusion of two
   warm-season grasses with different growth habits on seasonal forage
   biomass, soil cover and weed colonization. Three different pasture
   mixtures were evaluated under grazing: conventional pasture (CP) {[}tall
   fescue (Festuca arundinacea), white clover (Trifolium repens) and
   birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus)], CP with Paspalum dilatatum and
   CP with Paspalum notatum (CP+Pn). Forage biomass and soil cover were
   sampled thirteen times during a 3-year trial, and sampling times were
   grouped by season for the analyses. The mixtures with Paspalum showed
   higher soil cover in the autumn, while in the winter CP had higher soil
   cover than CP+Pn. Competition with tall fescue was similar between
   mixtures with Paspalum, when considering biomass, but it was higher in
   CP+Pn when considering soil cover. The inclusion of P.notatum increased
   biomass during the autumn but decreased the mixture performance during
   winter by reducing tall fescue soil cover. The addition of a warm-season
   grass species with a moderate competing ability like P.dilatatum is
   likely to avoid a negative impact on the cool-season component of the
   pasture.}},

Abstract = {{Four-species mixtures and pure stands of perennial ryegrass, tall
   fescue, white clover and red clover were grown in three-cut and five-cut
   systems at angstrom s, southern Norway, at a low fertilization rate
   (100kgNha(-1)year(-1)). Over a three-year experiment, we found strong
   positive effects of species diversity on annual dry-matter yield and
   yield stability under both cutting frequencies. The overyielding in
   mixtures relative to pure stands was highest in the five-cut system and
   in the second year. Among the possible pairwise species interaction
   effects contributing to the diversity effect, the grass-grass
   interaction was the strongest, being significant in both cutting systems
   and in all years. The grass-legume interactions were sometimes
   significant, but no significant legume-legume interaction could be
   detected. Competitive relationships between species varied from year to
   year and also between cutting systems. Estimations based on species
   identity effects and pair-specific interactions suggested that the
   optimal proportions of red clover, white clover, perennial ryegrass and
   tall fescue in seed mixtures would have been around 01, 02, 04 and 03 in

Journal = {{PASTORALISM-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Norway is committed to the two-fold policy objective of preserving
   biodiversity and maintaining traditional local livelihoods. This creates
   management dilemmas with the potential to undermine the legitimacy of
   both national and international policies. In this article, we take a
   social-ecological perspective to highlight how these two policy
   objectives are linked and interdependent and, therefore, subjected to
   complex dynamics between institutions and ecosystems. We use a case
   study in northern Norway to discuss trade-offs in the implementation of
   the two-fold conservation objectives.
   Based on interviews, a focus group meeting with 16 reindeer herders and
   stakeholders and participant observations during a grazing committee
   meeting, we identified that ecological dynamics between carnivores,
   sheep and grassland patterns are central to this trade-off. We
   demonstrate how current governance instruments in carnivore management
   do not address the spatial dynamics of carnivores leading to a perceived
   conflict between environmentalist groups and farmers around questions of
   carnivore protection and sheep killings by carnivores. Fragmentation in
   the multi-layered governance system prevents ongoing dialogue among
   various actors, thereby enhancing antagonisms while reducing the
   likelihood of the emergence and implementation of adaptation measures
   and practices.}},

Abstract = {{There is considerable controversy about the effects of plateau pika
   (Ochotona curzoniae, hereafter pika) on alpine grassland on the
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). On the one hand, pika is considered a
   keystone species. On the other hand, it is being poisoned. Although
   significant efforts have been made to study the effects of pika at a
   quadrat scale ( similar to m(2)), our knowledge about its distribution
   and effects at a larger scale is very limited. In this study, we
   investigated the direct effects, i.e., burying and grazing, of pika by
   upscaling field sampling at a quadrat scale to a plot scale (similar to
   1000m(2)) by aerial photographing. Altogether 168 plots were set on four
   different types of alpine grassland in a semiarid basin on the QTP.
   Results showed that (1) the effects of pika pile burying on the
   reduction of vegetation cover, biomass, soil carbon, and nitrogen were
   less than 10 \%, which was much smaller than the effects of bald
   patches; and (2) pika consumed 8-21\% of annual net primary production
   of grassland. We concluded that the direct burying and grazing effects
   of pika on alpine grassland were minor in this region. The quadcopter is
   an efficient and economic tool for long-term repeated monitoring over
   large regions for further understanding the role of pika.}},

   Area, Zimbabwe}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Three species of cranes are distributed widely throughout southern
   Africa, but little is known about how they respond to the changes in
   land-use that have occurred in this region. This study assessed habitat
   preference of the two crane species across land-use categories of the
   self contained small scale commercial farms of 30 to 40 ha per household
   (A1), large scale commercial agriculture farms of > 50 ha per household
   (A2) and Old Resettlement, farms of < 5 ha per household with communal
   grazing land in Driefontein Grasslands Important Bird Area (IBA),
   Zimbabwe. The study further explored how selected explanatory
   (environmental) habitat variables influence crane species abundance.
   Crane bird counts and data on influencing environmental variables were
   collected between June and August 2012. Our results show that varying
   land-use categories had an influence on the abundance and distribution
   of the Wattled Crane (Bugeranus carunculatus) and the Grey Crowned Crane
   (Belearica regulorum) across Driefontein Grasslands IBA. The Wattled
   Crane was widely distributed in the relatively undisturbed A2 farms
   while the Grey Crowned Crane was associated with the more disturbed land
   of A1 farms, Old Resettlement and its communal grazing land. Cyperus
   esculentus and percent (\%) bare ground were strong environmental
   variables best explaining the observed patterns in Wattled Crane
   abundance across land-use categories. The pattern in Grey Crowned Crane
   abundance was best explained by soil penetrability, moisture and grass
   height variables. A holistic sustainable land-use management that takes
   into account conservation of essential habitats in Driefontein
   Grasslands IBA is desirable for crane populations and other wetland
   dependent species that include water birds.}},

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{571}},
Pages = {{1048-1057}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{The Caatinga biome covers an area of 844,453 km(2) and has enormous
   endemic biodiversity, with unique characteristics that make it an
   exclusive Brazilian biome. It falls within the earth's tropical zone and
   is one of the several important ecoregions of Brazil. This biome
   undergoes natural lengthy periods of drought that cause losses in crop
   and livestock productivity, having a severe impact on the population.
   Due to the vulnerability of this ecosystem to climate change, livestock
   has emerged as the main livelihood of the rural population, being the
   precursor of the replacement of native vegetation by grazing areas. This
   study aimed to measure GHG emissions from two different soil covers:
   native forest (Caatinga) and pasture in the municipality of Sao Joao,
   Pernambuco State, in the years 2013 and 2014. GHG measurements were
   taken by using static chamber techniques in both soil covers. According
   to a previous search, so far, this is the first study measuring GHG
   emissions using the static chamber in the Caatinga biome. N2O emissions
   ranged from -1.0 to 4.2 mg m(-2) d(-1) and -1.22 to 3.4 mg m(-2) d(-1)
   in the pasture and Caatinga, respectively, and they did not
   significantly differ from each other. Emissions were significantly
   higher during dry seasons. Carbon dioxide ranged from -1.1 to 14.1 and
   1.2 to 15.8 g m(-2) d(-1) in the pasture and Caatinga, respectively. CO2
   emissions were higher in the Caatinga in 2013, and they were
   significantly influenced by soil temperature, showing an inverse
   relation. Methane emission ranged from 6.6 to 6.8 and -6.0 to 4.8 mg
   m(-2) d(-1) in the pasture and Caatinga, respectively, and was

Title = {{Community assembly and functional leaf traits mediate precipitation use
   efficiency of alpine grasslands along environmental gradients on the
   Tibetan Plateau}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{The alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau are sensitive and
   vulnerable to climate change. However, it is still unknown how
   precipitation use efficiency (PUE), the ratio of aboveground net primary
   productivity (ANPP) to precipitation, is related to community assembly
   of plant species, functional groups or traits for the Tibetan alpine
   grasslands along actual environmental gradients. We conducted a
   multisite field survey at grazing-excluded pastures across meadow,
   steppe and desert-steppe to measure aboveground biomass (AGB) in August,
   2010. We used species richness (SR), the Shannon diversity index, and
   cover-weighted functional group composition (FGC) of 1-xerophytes,
   2-mesophytes, and 3-hygrophytes to describe community assembly at the
   species level; and chose community-level leaf area index (LAIc),
   specific leaf area (SLAc), and species-mixed foliar delta C-13 to
   quantify community assembly at the functional trait level. Our results
   showed that PUE decreased with increasing accumulated active
   temperatures (AccT) when daily temperature average is higher than 5
   degrees C, but increased with increasing climatic moisture index (CMI),
   which was demined as the ratio of growing season precipitation (GSP) to
   AccT. We also found that PUE increased with increasing SR, the Shannon
   diversity index, FGC and LAIc, decreased with increasing foliar delta
   C-13, and had no relation with SLAc at the regional scale. Neither soil
   total nitrogen (STN) nor organic carbon has no influence on PUE at the
   regional scale. The community assembly of the Shannon index, LAIc and
   SLAc together accounted for 46.3\% of variance in PUE, whilst CMI
   accounted for 47.9\% of variance in PUE at the regional scale. This
   implies that community structural properties and plant functional traits
   can mediate the sensitivity of alpine grassland productivity in response
   to climate change. Thus, a long-term observation on community structural
   and functional changes is recommended for better understanding the
   response of alpine ecosystems to regional climate change on the Tibetan
   Plateau.}},

   and Fire}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{In grasslands, overgrazing by domestic livestock, fertilization, and
   introduction of exotic forage species leads to plant communities
   consisting of a mixture of native and exotic species. These degraded
   grasslands present a problem for land managers, farmers, and restoration
   ecologists concerned with improving biodiversity while continuing to use
   the land for livestock production. Here we assessed the response of
   butterfly and plant community composition to the use of fire and
   moderate grazing by domestic cattle on degraded grasslands dominated by
   exotic plants. We evaluated change by comparing experimental pastures to
   two reference sites that were grasslands dominated by native plants. We
   used two burning and grazing treatments: 1) patch-burn graze, a
   heterogeneously managed treatment, where one third of the pasture is
   burned each year and cattle have free access to the entire pasture, and
   2) graze-and-burn, a homogenously managed treatment, where the entire
   pasture is grazed each year and burned in its entirety every three
   years. We tested for change in the butterfly and plant community
   composition over seven years using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity measures.
   Over the course of seven years, degraded pastures in both treatments
   became more similar to reference sites with respect to the butterfly and
   plant communities. Only two butterfly species and two plant functional
   guilds exhibited significant linear trends over time, with varying
   responses. Compositional changes in both the butterfly and plant
   communities indicate that the use of moderate grazing and fire may shift
   butterfly and plant communities of exotic-dominated grasslands to be
   more similar to reference tall-grass prairies over time.}},

Abstract = {{Protected areas are essential, but not sufficient on their own, to
   conserve biodiversity into the future. Rangelands, used primarily for
   livestock grazing, have the potential to complement existing reserve
   systems and be used for ``off-reserve{''} conservation. Success relies
   on our ability to manage rangelands to simultaneously achieve positive
   economic outcomes for graziers while maintaining the ecological
   processes that support biodiversity. However, we argue that research has
   failed to effectively inform off-reserve conservation strategies,
   particularly in relation to vertebrate fauna. Most research has focused
   on the difference in faunal diversity between ungrazed and heavily
   grazed areas, but faunal responses between these extremes have received
   less attention. In reality, moderate levels of grazing seem more likely
   to achieve the ecological, economic and social balance that would be
   required for successful off reserve conservation on rangelands. Here we
   review the current knowledge on the impact of grazing by domestic
   livestock on terrestrial vertebrate fauna in rangelands, highlighting
   the relative lack of research on the impact of grazing regimes between
   the extremes. We argue that a more detailed understanding of vertebrate
   responses to different grazing intensities is required. Furthermore, if
   the potential for off-reserve conservation on rangelands is to be
   realized, graziers need management advice based on the integration of
   ecological, economic, and social data. Crown Copyright (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Although the impact of optimal stocking rate on rangeland health and
   ranch profitability has been extensively studied, grazing management
   practice has received far less attention in mathematical modeling
   analyses. This paper uses a mathematical model to examine the impacts of
   continuous grazing and multipaddock (MP) grazing on vegetation and
   livestock forage consumption. Simulations are carried out using
   parameters applicable to the southern tallgrass prairie of North
   America. On small areas of land with no difference between defoliation
   rates across different grazing methods, the performance of MP grazing is
   no better than continuous grazing. At the scale of commercial ranches,
   MP grazing with improved defoliation management improves grass
   composition and productivity, as well as livestock consumption relative
   to continuous grazing, especially with heavier stocking rates and
   unfavorable initial biomass composition. The advantages of MP grazing,
   however, are reduced with favorable rainfall conditions, light stocking,
   low levels of undesirable plants, and inadequate recovery periods. (C)

Abstract = {{Questions: How does the presence of grazers impact plant diversity at
   various spatial scales? What are the effects on plant beta-diversity and
   its two components, species turnover and nestedness? Are the effects
   caused by defoliation, trampling or defecating?
   Location: Twenty-four currently grazed and 24 abandoned wood-pasture
   sites in Central Finland.
   Methods: The species richness of vascular plants and bryophytes was
   studied at four spatial scales: within 4-m(2) subplots (alpha(1)),
   within 100-m(2) plots (alpha(2)), within sites (alpha(3)) and within the
   landscape (gamma). beta-Diversity was studied between subplots within
   plots (beta(1)), between plots within sites (beta(2)) and between sites
   within the landscape (beta(3)).
   Results: Currently grazed sites had higher species richness at all of
   the spatial scales (alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(3), gamma) and higher
   within-plot and within-site beta -diversities (beta(1) and beta(2)). At
   the within-plot scale (beta(1)) plant beta-diversity was increased
   primarily by variation in defoliation. At this scale both turnover and
   nestedness were increased by grazers. At the larger within-site scale
   (beta(2)) only turnover was increased, and it was mostly caused by
   variation in trampling intensities. Within the landscape (beta(3))
   currently grazed sites had higher between-site turnover and lower
   nestedness than abandoned sites.
   Conclusions: Grazing creates and maintains high species richness and
   beta-diversity of vascular plants and bryophytes, mostly due to high
   species turnover between patches. Defoliation, dunging and trampling are
   all important turnover agents, although their relative importance varies
   with spatial scale. At the landscape scale the currently grazed sites
   had high species turnover between them, and thus the conservation of all
   grazing-dependent species requires continued management at various
   sites, while high nestedness between abandoned sites implies that their
   biodiversity can be efficiently conserved through protecting the most
   species-rich sites.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Does the role of dispersal and light limitation for community
   assembly change in temperate semi-natural dry grasslands (SNDGs)
   post-abandonment?
   Location: Temperate calcareous semi-natural dry grasslands, western
   Estonia (58.642 N, 23.516 E).
   Methods: We compared taxonomic and functional community structure of
   semi-natural dry grasslands in Estonia at two time periods: first in
   1975 when traditional grazing prevailed, and again in 2013 when
   management had ceased for at least 30 yr. In order to assess functional
   community structure, we used community-weighted mean trait values and
   mean pair-wise distance as metrics of functional diversity for traits
   related to plant dispersal and adaptations to reduced light
   availability. Successional shifts in functional community structure were
   examined using regression and multivariate analysis.
   Results: Changes in community assembly of SNDGs post-abandonment were
   largely driven by more closed vegetation structure and subsequently
   reduced light availability, as well as altered availability of dispersal
   vectors. Importance of long-distance dispersal via grazing animals
   decreased while importance of bird dispersal increased under
   abandonment. At the same time, the importance of competition for light
   increased under abandonment. Results indicate that typical SNDG species
   are especially susceptible to abandonment because they are
   light-demanding and depend on dispersal by wind or epizoochory (i.e. on
   the fur of animals), and their decline likely leads to reduced
   small-scale species richness.
   Conclusions: Vegetation changes in abandoned SNDGs show that
   regular-management, by creating characteristic light and dispersal
   conditions, is highly important for maintaining both taxonomic and
   functional diversity. In particular, typical grassland species might be
   prone to local extinction as taller vegetation develops
   post-abandonment. The importance of dispersal processes for community
   assembly observed in grazed SNDGs thus highlights that successful
   grassland conservation should include maintenance of dispersal
   conditions. Grassland conservation should aim to preserve the whole
   ecosystem and account for the multiple ecosystem processes (e.g. light
   availability, dispersal), which simultaneously structure plant community
   composition.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation is one of the most severe anthropogenic pressures
   exerted on ecosystem's biodiversity. Empirical studies to date focused
   with an overriding interest on the effects of habitat loss or habitat
   fragmentation per se on species richness patterns detrimental to
   biogeochemical processes. To account for changes in ecosystem fluxes, we
   investigated how anthropogenic fragmentation affects primary
   productivity and carbon storage in temperate mountain grass-lands. A
   field study was conducted to assess the influence of grassland isolation
   on soil carbon stocks, N availability, species biomass, and plant
   functional groups distribution. We tested the hypothesis that increased
   isolation of grassland, within the land cover, decreases soil carbon
   stocks, and available N nutrient as well as aboveground biomass. Soil
   carbon concentration decreased with isolation but increased near the
   forest edge. We found significant differences in aboveground biomass
   distribution and relative contribution of plant functional groups
   between isolation conditions. The magnitude of edge effect on carbon
   stocks, N availability, and primary productivity intensified with
   increasing isolation as a consequence of the additive influence of
   edges. Our study reveals that the potential creation of artificially
   isolated patches diminished primary productivity, N availability, and C
   stocks. However, in highly managed landscapes, grazing pressure is an
   additional factor that changes biomass and nutrients patterns. We
   emphasize that spatial configuration of the landscape has a major role
   in modulating ecological flows and ecosystem service supply, in addition
   to changes in species richness.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Land use and corresponding habitat loss are major drivers of local
   species extinctions. Orthoptera as important grassland herbivores showed
   different responses to land-use intensity in different studies, and the
   susceptibility of this group remains unclear. We sampled annually for
   seven years 150 temperate grassland sites across three regions in
   Germany, for which land-use gradients were quantified as mowing,
   grazing, and fertilization intensity. We analyzed the effects of
   land-use intensity on orthopteran diversity and community abundance. To
   describe species-specific responses to environmental gradients, we
   employed a new approach termed ``niche model,{''} coupled with a
   randomization procedure, which is sensitive even for rare species for
   which trends may otherwise be difficult to detect. Based on
   abundance-weighted means for each species, we quantified the species'
   occurrence along land-use gradients and identified potential losers and
   winners of intensive land use. Overall, high land-use intensity
   negatively affected orthopteran diversity across years and regions,
   corresponding to decreases with high fertilization, mowing, and grazing
   intensity. Intensive mowing and grazing negatively affected abundance.
   Diversity and abundance increased with the time after the last cut. The
   niche model detected 15 of 29 Orthoptera species as losers of land use,
   showing significantly higher abundance in grasslands with low-intensity
   land use. Two species were winners of high land-use intensity, whereas
   the remaining 12 were assigned as opportunists. Most species were losers
   of high fertilization intensity, followed by frequent mowing. Grazing
   intensity was least detrimental at the species level. Omnivorous,
   herbivorous, and graminivorous species did not differ in their response
   to land-use intensity, whereas bryovorous/lichenivorous Tetrix species
   showed consistently negative responses to intensive land use. Our highly
   replicated, long-term and large-scale survey suggests that further
   land-use intensification threatens many Orthoptera and causes a
   consistent diversity loss. Low intensity of fertilization, infrequent
   mowing, and variable grazing will help to maintain a high diversity of
   orthopterans. The generality of our niche model approach advances
   studies on species' susceptibility in various study systems.}},

Abstract = {{The region of Southern Transylvania in Romania contains large expanses
   of species-rich grassland and mixed farmland. Within these landscapes,
   clusters of small, steep-sided slumping hills support mosaics of
   herbaceous vegetation caused by the heterogeneity in temperature and
   water supply and maintained by mowing or grazing. These are of
   conservation interest not only for the high species density, but also
   the relict steppe-like vegetation types especially found on their
   south-facing slopes. Usually surrounded by more intensively used mesic
   grassland, these hills can be considered patches of species-rich
   grassland vegetation. We therefore surveyed the vascular plants in 10
   m(2) plots on the south- and north-facing slopes of 50 hills in 12
   clusters in order to investigate the influence of their size and
   isolation on the species richness and composition of the vegetation. We
   found that larger hills had higher plot-scale species richness, a
   greater proportion of competitive species and a lower proportion of
   species of steppe-like vegetation, but only on their south-facing slopes
   where the conditions are more extreme. Both large and small hills should
   be considered as important habitats and potential sources of propagules
   for plant communities in the surrounding areas.}},

Abstract = {{Across Western Siberia, land use has changed substantially since the
   collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991: large cropland areas were
   abandoned and livestock numbers declined. In recent years these trends
   have partly been reversed, and an intensification of agricultural
   management has been observed that is still ongoing. We evaluated the
   impact of land use, as well as effects of landscape patterns and
   vegetation structure on Orthoptera communities and discuss them as
   drivers of community composition, species richness and abundance. We
   sampled Orthoptera using a box-quadrat on ancient grassland, ex-arable
   grassland (both including different management types: unmanaged, grazed
   and mown) and cereal fields. Landscape heterogeneity and composition
   strongly affected species richness and abundance of Orthoptera. Both
   were higher in grassland than in cropland, but did not differ
   significantly between ex-arable and ancient grasslands or different
   management practices. An Indicator Species Analysis revealed
   differentiation of Orthoptera communities between all management types.
   On croplands, the number of adult individuals and nymphs was influenced
   by the proportion of grassland in the surrounding landscape and tillage
   practices. Conservation tillage is most likely the key factor allowing
   Orthoptera to reproduce on croplands. After up to 24 years of
   succession, Orthoptera communities of ex-arable grasslands can be
   considered as completely recovered, as differences to ancient grasslands
   were minimal. Besides the continuation of low-intensity management,
   conservation strategies for this region should consider landscape
   composition and support habitat heterogeneity like ecotones with
   hemi-boreal forests in grassland-dominated landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate grasslands have suffered from severe habitat loss and
   degradation worldwide. In Russia, vast areas of forest-steppe grasslands
   have been converted to cropland during Soviet times, whilst remaining
   grasslands were often intensively grazed. Contrastingly, the collapse of
   the Soviet Union have resulted in a massive reduction in livestock
   numbers and cessation of management. Albeit relatively large natural
   grassland areas remained in the Western Siberian Plain, their present
   condition is poorly studied. We analysed plant species composition,
   functional structure and richness of grassland communities and tested
   for the effect of local factors (management, abiotic site conditions)
   and landscape factors (patch size, proportion of land cover types) on
   diversity patterns. Abiotic site conditions, mainly soil moisture and
   salinity, differentiated distinct community types. Overall, species
   richness was highest in meadow steppe communities with lower soil
   moisture and salinity. Grazing intensity and litter accumulation due to
   cessation of management were significant negative related to species
   richness and shaped the functional structure. At the landscape scale,
   diversity in meadow steppe grasslands was higher in forest-grassland
   mosaics and in small remnants isolated in a matrix of cropland. Our
   findings highlight that meadow steppes suffered massively under the
   historical habitat loss and high grazing pressure. Small species-rich
   remnants are evidence of the former extent of meadow steppe habitats in
   agricultural landscape, but are likely threatened by an extinction debt.
   Low intense, irregular mowing maintained species-rich meadow steppe in
   forest- grassland mosaics, but currently such practices are declining.}},

Abstract = {{The application of payment for ecosystem services schemes to dryland
   areas has been limited, particularly for schemes that seek to improve
   the grassland upon which resource users in these landscapes depend. The
   high levels of climatic and resource variability, strength of informal
   institutions governing resource use and contested nature of resource
   decline are examples of defining characteristics that may challenge the
   application of more conventional payment for ecosystem services schemes
   in dryland contexts. We used a social-ecological systems framework to
   (i) help identify design criteria for effective and efficient payment
   for ecosystem services schemes in drylands under a pastoral land-use,
   and (ii) explore the applicability of the framework to dryland areas.
   Using eco-compensation schemes in the Chinese governed areas of the
   Eurasian steppe as a case study, we found that the framework adequately
   identified the need for non-equilibrium dynamics to be incorporated into
   scheme design. However, the framework was less able to explicitly
   enunciate the importance of micro-economics and cultural values for
   scheme viability. In contexts like the Eurasian steppe where some level
   of grazing may maximise the species richness of grasslands,
   acknowledging history of use in the resource unit subsystem component of
   the framework, not just the user subsystem component, would improve the
   framework. The explicit incorporation of contested issues into the
   framework is also needed, as dryland areas have a history of being
   misunderstood by non-dryland cultures, researchers and policymakers. We
   conclude that tailoring a general diagnostic tool towards the specific
   social-ecological attributes of the drylands under a pastoral land-use
   will improve the ability of payment for ecosystem services schemes to
   reach their conservation aims.}},

Pages = {{2543-2561}},

Abstract = {{After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, 12 million ha of
   cropland were abandoned in the steppe zone of Kazakhstan. At the same
   time livestock numbers crashed, leaving large areas of steppe without
   any grazing. We aimed to investigate, to which degree spontaneous
   succession on former cropland leads to the restoration of native steppe
   vegetation, and how this process is influenced by changing grazing
   patterns. We recorded biomass and vegetation characteristics as well as
   local soil and landscape variables in 151 quadrats of 100 m(2), covering
   89 plots on former cropland abandoned in the early 1990s and 62
   reference plots of near-natural steppe grassland that was never
   ploughed. About half of the plots of each category were located in a
   remote region where grazing has been absent for ca. 20 years, whereas
   the other half was located in a region with moderate livestock grazing.
   While there were no differences in the diversity, structure and plant
   life form composition of currently grazed and un-grazed near-natural
   steppe grasslands, corresponding successional plots on abandoned arable
   land exhibited significant differences. Grazed plots on former fields
   showed higher species richness and a higher cover of dwarf shrubs
   (mostly Artemisia spec.), ruderals and perennial herbs. At the same
   time, immigration of typical steppe species was much more successful.
   Contrary, in the absence of any grazing we found species-poor swards
   dominated by Stipa lessingiana and Leymus ramosus exhibiting an
   increasing frequency of wildfires due to litter accumulation. After
   15-20 years, secondary steppe grasslands still differed substantially
   from their near-natural references. Our results suggest that grazing is
   mandatory to fully restore the original near-natural steppe vegetation
   and the underlying processes of pyric herbivory.}},

Abstract = {{Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 around 45 million
   hectares of arable land became abandoned across Russia. Our study
   focused on the recovery potential and conservation value of grassland
   vegetation on ex-arable land in the Tyumen region of the Western
   Siberian grain belt. We compared ex-arable grasslands of different
   successional stages with ancient grasslands as reference for the final
   stage of succession along a climatic gradient from the pre-taiga to the
   forest steppe zone. Plant community composition and species richness of
   ex-arable land clearly developed towards reference sites over time, but
   even after 24 years of abandonment, the grassland vegetation had not
   totally recovered. The gamma-diversity of vascular plants was slightly
   higher on ex-arable land than in ancient grasslands but the mean
   alpha-diversity was still moderately lower. A significant proportion of
   the vegetation of ex-arable land still consisted of ruderal and mesic
   grassland species and the number and cover of meadow-steppe species was
   significantly lower than in ancient grasslands. Grazing and time since
   abandonment positively affected the reestablishment of target grassland
   species, whereas it was negatively affected by the cover of grasses. In
   contrast to ex-arable land, the conservation value of arable land is
   only modest. Therefore, future intensification of land use is most
   likely less harmful if directed to existing arable land. Re-cultivation
   of ex-arable land and grassland improvement operations such as seeding
   of competitive grass species are major threats for the biodiversity of
   secondary grasslands on ex-arable land in the forest steppe zone of
   Western Siberia.}},

Title = {{Swedish Forestry, Forest Pasture Grazing by Livestock, and Game Browsing
   Pressure Since 1900}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT AND HISTORY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Growing numbers of wild ungulates are increasingly seen by concerned
   authorities in Europe as posing serious management problems, which
   include increasing browsing pressure by moose (Alces alces) and roe deer
   (Capreolus capreolus) in Swedish forests. Recent investigations by the
   Swedish Forest Agency identify high browsing pressure as the main reason
   for a recent decline in regeneration of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris),
   one of the two main commercial species in Swedish forestry. The high
   browsing pressure is also having a negative impact on biodiversity.
   Thus, voices within the forest community claim that browsing pressure
   has never been so high. This paper examines that claim from a historical
   perspective by comparing livestock grazing in forest pastures a century
   ago with contemporary game browsing, and identifying the main factors
   driving both the livestock exodus from Swedish forests during the first
   half of the twentieth century and the rapid increase in deer populations
   during the second half. Finally, testing the claim that browsing impact
   has never been so high, past grazing and present browsing are
   theoretically sized up and compared. Estimates of live weights and
   numbers of large herbivores in 1902 and 2012 are used. The result
   indicates that the claim might possibly be lacking in historical
   context.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing is a crucial cause of vegetation degradation and
   desertification in sandy lands. The sparse-elm grassland of Horqin Sandy
   Land, China has suffered severe degradation of biodiversity and
   ecosystem services. Management to exclude grazing is often necessary for
   ecological restoration, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. We
   report effects on vegetation and soils in a 10-year experiment to
   exclude livestock, completely or seasonally, in comparison with a
   continuously grazed area in Horqin. Complete exclusion of grazing and
   restriction of grazing to summer both led to significantly increased
   plant cover and density relative to the grazed control. Species richness
   increased, reflected in higher Shannon-Wiener indices; only complete
   exclusion increased the Simpson diversity index, whereas Pielou evenness
   was significantly lowest under seasonal grazing. Exclosure treatments
   were also associated with improved soil texture, and increased water
   retention, available nitrogen, total nitrogen, total carbon and total
   phosphorus. Soil pH and C/N ratio were highest under the seasonal
   grazing regime. The results indicated that exclosure management indeed
   improved biodiversity and ecosystem services in an erosion-prone region.
   Although total exclosure was most effective in restoration of degraded
   sparse-elm grassland, seasonal grazing management was highly beneficial
   and represented a good compromise with resource utilization and economic
   development. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands in northern China and the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau are
   particularly important to both ecosystem functioning and pastoral
   livelihoods. Although there are numerous degradation studies on the
   effect of livestock grazing across the region, they are largely only
   published in Chinese, and most focus on single sites. Based on case
   studies from 100 sites, covering a mean annual precipitation gradient of
   95-744 mm, we present a comprehensive, internationally accessible review
   on the impact of livestock grazing on vegetation and soils. We compared
   ungrazed or slightly grazed sites with moderately and heavily grazed
   sites by evaluating changes in two indicator groups: vegetation (plant
   species richness, vegetation cover, aboveground biomass, belowground
   biomass and root/shoot ratio) and soil (pH, bulk density, organic C,
   total N, total P and available P). Most indicators declined with
   intensified grazing, while soil pH, bulk density and belowground biomass
   increased. Available P showed no clear response. Variables within
   indicator groups were mostly linearly correlated at a given grazing
   intensity. Relative grazing effects on different indicators varied along
   specific abiotic gradients. Grazing responses of plant species richness,
   aboveground biomass, soil bulk density, total N and available P
   interacted with precipitation patterns, while grazing effects on
   belowground biomass were influenced by temperature. Elevation had impact
   on grazing responses of aboveground biomass and soil organic carbon.
   Complex grazing effects reflect both methodological inconsistency and
   ecological complexity. Further assessments should consider specific
   characteristics of different indicators in the context of the local
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate grasslands have suffered disproportionally from conversion to
   cropland, degradation and fragmentation. A large proportion of the
   world's remaining near-natural grassland is situated in Kazakhstan. We
   aimed to assess current and emerging threats to steppe and semi-desert
   biodiversity in Kazakhstan and evaluate conservation research
   priorities. We conducted a horizon-scanning exercise among
   conservationists from academia and practice. We first compiled a list of
   45 potential threats. These were then ranked by the survey participants
   according to their perceived severity, the need for research on them,
   and their novelty. The highest-ranked threats were related to changes in
   land use (leading to habitat loss and deterioration), direct persecution
   of wildlife, and rapid infrastructure development due to economic and
   population growth. Research needs were identified largely in the same
   areas, and the mean scores of threat severity and research need were
   highly correlated. Novel threats comprised habitat loss by photovoltaic
   and wind power stations, climate change and changes in agriculture such
   as the introduction of biofuels. However, novelty was not correlated
   with threat severity or research priority, suggesting that the most
   severe threats are the established ones. Important goals towards more
   effective steppe and semi-desert conservation in Kazakhstan include more
   cross-sector collaboration (e.g. by involving stakeholders in
   conservation and agriculture), greater allocation of funds to
   under-staffed areas (e.g. protected area management), better
   representativeness and complementarity in the protected area system and
   enhanced data collection for wildlife monitoring and threat assessments
   (including the use of citizen-science databases).}},

Abstract = {{Grazing exclusion is widely used globally to restore degraded
   grasslands. Plant diversity has important impacts on grassland ecosystem
   functions, including grassland productivity and carbon storage. In this
   study, we selected a Kobresia meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to
   investigate how grazing exclusion affects plant diversity. Inorganic
   nitrogen (NH4 (+) and NO3 (-)) was also measured because its
   availability impacts plant growth. We found that plant diversity in the
   meadow was significantly lower under grazing exclusion (fenced meadow)
   for 9 years compared with moderate grazing. Accumulated litter was
   significantly higher under grazing exclusion (386.41 g m(-2)) compared
   with grazing (58.77 g m(-2)). Soil inorganic nitrogen at 0-5 cm depth
   was significantly higher under grazing exclusion (13.60 x 10(-2) g
   kg(-1)) than under grazing (9.40 x 10(-2) g kg(-1)). The composition of
   the four functional groups (grasses, sedges, legumes, and forbs) might
   alter in response to significant changes in the amount of litter and
   soil available nitrogen content under grazing exclusion compared with
   grazing. However, the enhanced soil available nitrogen content showed
   weak feedbacks on plant diversity. In conclusion, light limitation
   induced by increased amounts of litter may be the main factor causing
   decreased plant diversity in grazing-excluded meadows compared with
   moderately grazed meadows.}},

   grasslands of southern South America}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{New livestock production models need to simultaneously meet the
   increasing global demand for meat and preserve biodiversity and
   ecosystem services. Since the 16th century beef cattle has been produced
   on the Pampas and Campos native grasslands in southern South America,
   with only small amounts of external inputs. Wesynthesised 242 references
   from peer-reviewed and grey literature published between 1945 and
   mid-2015 and analysed secondary data to examine the evidence on the
   ecosystem services provided by this grassland biodiversity hotspot and
   the way they are affected by land use changes and their drivers. The
   analysis followed the requirements of systematic review from the PRISMA
   statement (Moher et al 2009 Acad. Clin. Ann. Intern. Med. 151 264-9).
   The Pampas and Campos provide feed for 43 million heads of cattle and 14
   million sheep. The biome is habitat of 4000 native plant species, 300
   species of birds, 29 species of mammals, 49 species of reptiles and 35
   species of amphibians. The soils of the region stock 5\% of the soil
   organic carbon of Latin America on3\% of its area. Driven by high prices
   of soybean, the soybean area increased by 210\% between 2000 and 2010,
   at the expense of 2 million ha (5\%) of native grassland, mostly in the
   Pampas. Intensification of livestock production was apparent in two
   spatially distinct forms. In subregions where cropping increased,
   intensification of livestock production was reflected in an increased
   use of grains for feed as part of feedlots. In subregions dominated by
   native grasslands, stocking rates increased. The review showed that land
   use change and grazing regimes with low forage allowances were
   predominantly associated with negative effects on ecosystem service
   provision by reducing soil organic carbon stocks and the diversity of
   plants, birds and mammals, and by increasing soil erosion. We found
   little quantitative information on changes in the ecosystem services
   water provision, nutrient cycling and erosion control. We discuss how
   changing grazing regimes to higher forage allowance can contribute to
   greater meat production and enhancing ecosystem services from native
   grasslands. This would require working with farmers on changing their
   management strategies and creating enabling economic conditions.}},

Title = {{Evidence based review: positive versus negative effects of livestock
   grazing on wildlife. What do we really know?}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{More than a quarter of earth's land surface is used for grazing domestic
   livestock. Livestock grazing is generally assumed to negatively affect
   wildlife, however, a number of studies have found positive impacts as
   well. Weconducted an evidence-based review of the existing literature
   using a series of livestock-and wildlife-related search words to
   systematically query Google Scholar and Web of Science. A total of 807
   sources were included in the final list, including 646 primary sources
   which reported original data. The majority of studies were conducted in
   North America (338) or Europe (123), with many fewer from Africa (57),
   Australia (54), Central/South America (43), or Asia (31). Most studies
   examined birds (330) and mammals (262), with fewer including reptiles
   (91) or amphibians (58). We extracted further information from studies
   that included mammals on positive, negative, and neutral effects of
   livestock grazing on mammals. We found that livestock change vegetation
   structure and cover in ways important to small mammals, while ungulates
   may be affected more by interference competition and changes in forage
   quantity and quality. Community-level total abundance of small mammals
   typically declines with grazing. Species richness of small mammals
   either declines or stays the same, as many studies found a change in
   species composition from ungrazed to grazed sites while the number of
   species remained similar. Individual species responses of small mammals
   vary. Voles, harvest mice, cotton rats, and shrews show consistently
   negative responses to grazing while deer mice, kangaroo rats, ground
   squirrels, and lagomorphs show positive or variable responses. In
   general, species adapted to open habitats are often positively affected
   by grazing, while species needing denser cover are negatively affected.
   Studies of wild ungulates are more variable in methodology and quality
   than those for small mammals. Wefound more negative (n = 86) than
   positive (n = 34) ungulate responses overall, however, most studies have
   been on browsers and mixed feeders, namely deer and elk, and there is
   little available data for other groups. Although data is limited,
   several of the grazing species in Africa may show a trend toward
   positive responses, suggesting possible facilitation. For a number of
   species, responses varied by season. We find a strong need for
   additional research on ungulates of varying diets and body sizes,
   especially in the developing world, and across longer time scales to
   examine possible tradeoffs between competition and facilitation from
   livestock.}},

Abstract = {{1. Biodiversity-rich grasslands have been severely impacted by
   agricultural intensification. Although agri-environment schemes (AES)
   have been launched partly to combat grassland biodiversity erosion, they
   could neither halt nor revert it, and this calls for alternative
   solutions.
   2. We carried out controlled experiments on the effects of three mowing
   regimes on the arthropod biodiversity of extensively managed meadows,
   testing whether alternative mowing regimes can improve AES
   effectiveness: (i) mowing according to the Swiss AES prescriptions, i.e.
   first cut not before 15 June (control meadows); (ii) first cut not
   before 15 July (delayed mowing); (iii) refuge left uncut on 10-20\% of
   the meadow area, otherwise first cut not before 15 June. Leaf-and
   planthoppers (Auchenorrhyncha) and spiders (Araneae) were sampled before
   and after mowing during 3 years, which enabled testing for immediate
   (within season) and carry-over (1 year to the next) effects.
   3. Regarding immediate effects, Auchenorrhyncha and Araneae increased in
   abundance under the delayed mowing regime, with densities 3.5 and 1.8
   times higher, respectively, than in control meadows. Furthermore, a
   positive carryover effect was detected for Araneae density under the
   delayed mowing regime. The refuge mowing regime had no effect on
   abundance. Finally, no statistically significant changes were detected
   for species richness and diversity (Shannon index) after 2 years of
   manipulations.
   4. We conclude that delaying the first cut in extensively managed
   meadows promotes these two taxa. It could be easily implemented by
   slight adjustments of the extant grassland AES.}},

Title = {{The effects of land management (grazing intensity) vs. the effects of

   concentration in Southern Patagonia}},

Abstract = {{Grazing is an economically important activity in Southern Patagonia's
   steppe and woodland ecosystems. In the past, emphasis has been on
   maximizing the provisioning capacity of these ecosystems with little
   concern for the longer term conservation of the ecosystem services
   related to climate regulation, like carbon sequestration. This is
   changing rapidly as livestock producers in the region work to develop a
   certification scheme for sustainable land management for Patagonians
   rangelands. This study is a scientific contribution towards this broader
   social objective in which we test whether soil C concentration in
   topsoil (10 cm depth) can be used as an indicator of rangeland
   condition. Data on climate, soil chemistry, topography, ecosystem type
   and stocking rates were obtained from the PEBANPA network of permanent
   plots database for 145 sites across Southern Patagonia. These variables
   were used as independent variables in a partial least squares regression
   in which top soil C was the dependent variable. The effects of land use
   (stocking rate) on top soil C were barely detectable at the regional
   scale in Patagonia. Top soil C was however strongly associated with
   other independent variables, notably soil chemistry and climate
   variables and also vegetation type. Thus, changes in land use management
   may not have a significant impact on soil carbon sequestration in these
   types of ecosystems. This may be because many factors interact to
   determine top soil C such that the footprint of overgrazing on top soil
   C is drowned out at the regional scale by other variables. This
   highlights the need for further work to develop indicators for
   sustainable land management in the region. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally, studies of habitat fragmentation have focused on spatial
   isolation of habitats. Meanwhile, the role of fragmentation of land
   ownership and hence of parcelization of habitats remains, particularly
   in relation to management of semi-natural grasslands, not well
   understood.
   We propose that, especially in a Danish context, fragmentation of land
   ownership leads to parcelization of semi-natural grassland habitats.
   This results in small parcel sizes, obstructing cost effective
   management in terms of grazing and mowing and consequently leads to
   encroachment of scrubs, threatening biodiversity.
   We applied national, spatially explicit information about land
   ownership, management, semi-natural grasslands and vegetation height to
   examine the relationships between parcel size, management and the
   proportion of scrubs on semi-natural grasslands.
   Results from a regression analysis show that parcel size is
   significantly negatively related to proportion of scrubs; i.e. small
   parcels are associated with higher proportions of scrubs compared to
   large parcels. The results also show that the size of ownership parcels
   has a stronger explanatory power for the proportion of scrub compared to
   the size of habitat parcels, where ownership boundaries are not taken
   into account. Furthermore, parcels, with legal obligations for
   management, have significantly lower proportion of scrubs compared to
   parcels without management obligations.
   Efforts for conservation of and improvement of biodiversity on
   semi-natural grassland should pay increasing attention towards the
   importance of fragmentation of land ownership and parcelization of
   habitats. Our results point at the need for cross-farm cooperation to
   secure continuous grassland management to prevent scrub encroachment.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Southern Africa's grassland biodiversity is threatened by habitat
   transformation such as commercial forestry. Ecological networks (ENs)
   have been instigated to alleviate the pressure of habitat transformation
   on local biodiversity. ENs are large scale webs of corridors and patches
   of natural vegetation criss-crossing production landscapes that can
   simulate conditions in protected areas (PAs). Many ENs have lost many
   native large mammal species, which have been replaced by domestic
   livestock to retain natural grazing dynamics, which could have an impact
   on the long-term value of ENs for insects. Here we compared dung beetle,
   butterfly and grasshopper diversity in ENs across a landscape mosaic of
   timber plantations, where 1) wild megaherbivores were maintained, 2) in
   ENs where these herbivores were replaced by livestock and, 3) in a
   nearby World Heritage PA which retained its natural complement of
   megaherbivores. Sites in the PA far from any plantation were similar in
   composition to those in the wild grazed EN. Presence of the wild grazers
   improved the alpha-and beta-diversity of all focal insect taxa when
   compared to domestic grazing. Furthermore, species composition shows
   significant differences between the two grazing systems indicating that
   an assemblage of native large mammals facilitates insect diversity
   conservation. We support the maintenance or introduction of large native
   mammals in ENs or similar conservation areas in production landscapes to
   simulate the ecological conditions and natural heterogeneity in nearby
   PAs.}},

Title = {{Plant functional trait diversity regulates the nonlinear response of
   productivity to regional climate change in Tibetan alpine grasslands}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 19}},
Abstract = {{The biodiversity-productivity relationship is still under debate for
   alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. We know little about direct
   and indirect effects of biotic and abiotic drivers on this relationship,
   especially in regard to plant functional trait diversity. Here, we
   examine how aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and
   precipitation use efficiency (PUE) respond to climate, soil and
   community structure across alpine grasslands on the Northern Tibetan
   Plateau. We found that both ANPP and PUE showed nonlinear patterns along
   water availability and site altitude variation, which together accounted
   for 80.3\% and 68.8\% of variation in ANPP and PUE, respectively, by
   optimal generalized additive models. Functional trait divergence (FTD)
   and community weighted mean (CWM) of plant functional traits were as
   important as plant species diversity (PSD) for explaining the nonlinear
   productivity-climate relationship. These findings were confirmed by
   results from principal component analyses and structural equation
   models. We also found that FTD was negatively correlated with PSD across
   different alpine grasslands. Our results implicate: first, the
   combinatorial influences of temperature and precipitation gradients are
   important for predicting alpine grassland dynamics; second, the
   convergence and divergence of plant functional traits may have the
   potential to elucidate the effect of plant diversity on ecosystem
   functionality.}},

Abstract = {{Free grazing and herding of local breeds have a long tradition in
   management and conservation of extended grassland habitats such as
   alkali steppes. However, there is a lack in studies evaluating the
   effects of grazing types and regimes on the vegetation composition and
   functional diversity. We selected Artemisia steppes, a widespread type
   of alkali steppes, to study the changes of vegetation composition and
   diversity along a grazing intensity gradient. We recorded the cover of
   vascular plant species, in altogether 150, 2 x 2-m-sized plots of 15
   steppes in 2014. The steppes were managed by free grazing, traditional
   Hungarian Grey cattle grazing (low, moderate and high intensity), or by
   heavy grazing (Grey cattle and sheep, and additional donkey grazing). We
   answered the following questions: (i) How do the species richness,
   diversity and species evenness change along the increasing intensity of
   grazing? (ii) How does the grazing affect the functional trait
   composition along the intensity gradient? (iii) How similar is the
   composition and diversity of free grazed steppes to the pastoral grazed
   ones? We detected no significant differences in species richness but a
   humped-back curve with a peak at the medium grazing intensity was found
   for the Shannon diversity, evenness and the proportion of subordinated
   target species. The highest Rao's quadratic entropy was found for low
   intensity grazing. The lowest scores of multi-trait functional evenness
   were detected for the medium grazing intensity, while for multi-trait
   functional divergence both medium and very high intensity displayed low
   scores. The intensity of grazing was negatively correlated with the
   plant height and LDMC, while positively with the rosette forming, SLA,
   thousand-seed weights, terminal velocity and flowering period. Our
   results suggest that for the highest functional diversity a low
   intensity traditional cattle grazing is recommended. A medium grazing
   intensity should be chosen to have the highest proportion of
   subordinated target species of conservation interest, and the highest
   species diversity and evenness. Our findings suggest that free grazing
   and low intensity traditional grazing can be substitutive to each other;
   various grazing intensities from low to medium, alternating in space
   and/or time can be appropriate to maintain high compositional diversity.

Abstract = {{The reduction of human use in many grassland systems across Europe has
   led to bush encroachment and a loss of biodiversity. Low intensity
   grazing systems by livestock has often been used as a cost-effective
   management tool to counteract this process. However, not all
   semi-natural grasslands are suitable for this due to large distance from
   human settlements or adverse environmental conditions. In this study we
   address the question whether natural wild large ungulates can be a
   useful management tool as well. In nutrient-limited systems, large
   herbivores can affect vegetation dynamics by redistribution of nutrients
   next to their direct effects on the vegetation. They can preferentially
   forage plant species and deposit their pellets at other locations
   leading to nutrient redistribution. We studied whether moose (Alces
   alces) in the Biebrza National Park (Poland), plays a role in nitrogen
   dynamics. Microscopic analyses of faeces showed that 57\% of the diet
   consisted of Salix cinerea, which was preferentially foraged upon
   indicated by a positive Jacobs' selectivity index. Pellet density was
   significantly higher in patches of S. cinerea compared to the
   surrounding vegetation. Based on the chemical composition of moose
   pellets and the pellet density, we calculated that moose-derived N
   (faeces and urine) leads to a relevant N-input in willow patches
   compared to other sources of N in the system. We show that moose do not
   redistribute nitrogen between different vegetation types but instead
   speed up the local recycling of nitrogen in patches dominated by willows
   during the growing season. As a consequence, nutrients become quicker
   available here than in other parts of the system. We hypothesize that
   enhanced N-availability in willow patches may off-set the growth
   reduction caused by moose browsing on willows, which fits to the
   observed continuous expansion of willows in the study area despite high
   density of moose. This suggests that moose likely stimulate the growth
   of willow rather than the often supposed suppression of this woody
   species. In these systems, more labour-intensive management (f.e.
   mowing) is required to counteract bush encroachment. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Cattle grazing is a traditional agricultural activity and one of the
   obligatory factors for maintaining steppe ecosystems. The impact of
   grazing depends on its intensity, site area, soil, topography, and
   microclimatic conditions. Both intensive grazing and long-term cessation
   differently affect various components of the steppe biota. During the
   research, cursorial spiders and true bugs were collected in grazed and
   ungrazed gullies in northeastern Ukraine. Seventy true bug and 73 spider
   species were recovered from the ungrazed gully and 65 true bug and 50
   spider species from the grazed one. More than a 20-year grazing
   cessation resulted in the partial overgrowth of the gully bottom by
   arboreal and shrub vegetation and the predominance of meadow herb
   species. Consequently, spider assemblages being the richest in species
   number and individuals lost their steppe traits. Ungrazed south-facing
   slope covered with typical steppe vegetation harbored the most
   steppe-like spider assemblage and maintained abundance of steppe
   specialists. Spider assemblages of the grazed gully were the poorest.
   Species richness, number of individuals and ecological groups of true
   bugs depended on orographic conditions, being more divers on the gully
   slopes (58-60 species vs. 42-44 species in the bottoms). The true bug
   individual numbers were the highest on the grazed slope while in the
   bottoms it did not change with grazing. In general, cursorial spiders
   were better indicators of the grazing pressure than true bugs. At the
   study site, no specific pastoral assemblages of both arthropod groups
   were indentified. Nevertheless, patched grazing was necessary for
   maintaining steppe-like vegetation and arthropod assemblages in the
   gully bottoms. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Natural grazing refuges can contribute significantly to plant and animal
   diversity in grazed ecosystems, particularly when herbivore densities
   are high. When natural grazing refuges are absent, artificial refuges
   could be created, for example by means of fencing. It remains, however,
   unclear how grazing refuges affect the diversity of various taxa in
   their surroundings. Edge effects can be expected to be positive for
   biodiversity because at these edges minimal disturbance is combined with
   beneficial light conditions for plant diversity. This can be expected to
   decrease with increasing distance and to differ between matrix
   vegetation types.
   Here, we investigated the impact of herbivore exclusion through fencing
   on communities of plants and various invertebrate taxa in a rewilding
   area on very productive soil, the Oostvaardersplassen, The Netherlands.
   The area is grazed year round by Heck cattle, konik horses and red deer,
   at a combined density of approximately 2.4 animal ha(-1). Ten exclosures
   (13 x 12 m) were erected in 2010 and plant communities were monitored
   for three years. In the third year, pitfall trapping, earthworm counts
   and plant surveys were performed in the centre, at the edge, at 10 m and
   at 20 m distance from each exclosure.
   Plant species richness declined strongly at the centre of the
   exclosures, but remained high outside the exclosures and at their edges.
   Earthworm, isopod, myriapod and ground beetle diversity increased in the
   exclosures, but showed small or no differences in species composition,
   while weevils showed a decrease. Spider, true bug, and leafhopper
   diversity did not differ, but showed large changes in species
   composition. For leaf-, dung and click beetles, neither diversity nor
   species composition differed systematically between treatments. For all
   taxa, diversity at the exclosure edges was as high as in the most
   diverse treatments, thus, combining all taxa to calculate multidiversity
   showed species richness to peak at the edge of the exclosures, but this
   positive edge-effect extended less than 10 metres.
   We conclude that when natural grazing refuges are not present, the
   creation of grazing refuges may thus be an effective management tool to
   increase diversity. Because exclosure edges support the highest
   multidiversity, maximising the edge length will have most beneficial
   effects for grassland flora and fauna, which can be achieved by creating
   many small, rather than few large refuges, or by creating serrated
   rather than straight edges. Such positive effects can be expected to be
   beneficial to higher trophic levels such as birds and other vertebrates.

Abstract = {{In the framework of grassland conservation, extensive grazing represents
   a management tool which is both cheaper than mechanical management and
   produces a highly diverse landscape mosaic, thus addressing economic and
   conservation purposes. The understanding of the key ecological processes
   involved in grazing systems is a basic step towards the sustainable
   application of such a system. The aims of this study were: (1)
   assessment of the grazing pressure and the grazing damage in a fenced
   cattle pasture; (2) identification of the environmental factors driving
   the grazing pressure; (3) development of a mathematical model (based on
   multivariate linear regression analysis) explaining the grazing pressure
   in the area; and (4) modeling of a grazing pattern scenario that would
   result from manipulation of an environmental variable.
   Management facilities were found to be the main factors driving the
   behavior of grazing cattle and, consequently, the distribution of
   undergrazed and overgrazed areas, with the highest grazing pressure
   close to drinking troughs. The search for new foraging areas promotes a
   better distribution of animals in the pasture as shown by the increase
   in grazed area frequented by cattle during the season.
   Grazing pressure modeling is a potentially effective low cost
   methodology to support biodiversity preservation and the efficient use
   of pastures in specific situations, such as habitats listed in Directive
   92/43/EEC. It can be extended to studies at a Pan-European scale by
   using recently developed data sources and instruments. Pasture
   management based on the application of our model could be used to
   optimize grazing patterns without costly repositioning of fences. (C)

Abstract = {{We present a case study illustrating a multidisciplinary approach for
   characterizing, mapping and monitoring the bio-ecological properties of
   Mediterranean mountain grasslands in extensive grazing systems. The
   approach was developed to provide the basis for the management plan of a
   cluster of Natura 2000 special conservation areas in the Central
   Apennine mountains, Italy (with a total area of 79,500 ha, including
   22,130 ha of grasslands). It includes a novel methodology for estimating
   sustainable stocking rates of different plant communities, at a detailed
   spatial scale over large areas, based on the integration of: (i) a
   classification of grassland types, based on physical habitat
   stratification and vegetation sampling; (ii) a forage-value assessment
   of each grassland type, obtained from field sampling of botanical
   composition and corrected with remote-sensing information on pasture
   microtopography; (iii) an estimate of primary productivity at a detailed
   spatial scale, obtained from the remote-sensed Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) calibrated with biomass field data.
   Additionally, to obtain a bioclimatic characterization of the grasslands
   and to determine the optimal grazing season for each grassland type,
   intra-annual phenological signatures were obtained from the Enhanced
   Vegetation Index (EVI). Given the inherent limitations in the
   sustainable stocking rates concept, and the particular susceptibility of
   dry grasslands to changes in grazing regimes, we tested two biological
   indicators, the Auchenorrhyncha quality index (AQI) and the
   Arthropod-based biological soil quality index (QBS-ar). These indicators
   take into account above- and below-ground arthropod diversity,
   respectively, and are applied here for the first time to the specific
   purpose of monitoring grazing load effects on ecological quality and
   biodiversity of Natura 2000 dry grasslands. We conclude that: (i) it is
   possible to effectively integrate biomass estimates, obtained from
   publicly available satellite data, with a relatively simple field
   sampling of botanical composition, to achieve a detailed spatialization
   of sustainable stocking rates; (ii) within the same Natura 2000 habitat
   type there can be a large spatial heterogeneity in both sustainable
   stocking rates and optimal stocking season: thus, grazing should be kept
   under careful human control to maintain the habitats in the desired
   conservation status; (iii) while plant species richness was not
   correlated to grazing intensity, both AQI and QBS-ar had a significant
   negative correlation to grazing levels and can thus be useful for
   monitoring the actual ``sustainability{''} of livestock loads on
   different aspects of grassland ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The differential effect of main grassland management types (primarily
   grazing and mowing) on plant species richness has been discussed in many
   papers. In-depth investigations, focusing on the effects of particular
   management attributes (herbage removal intensity, timing, etc.) are less
   frequent. We propose a new, evidence-based conceptual model for
   quantifying the specific effects of particular management attributes on
   the richness and diversity of plant species. The applicability of the
   model was tested in Central-Hungarian species-rich meadow-steppe
   grasslands, characterised by different management regimes. Two
   management attributes involved in this study (herbage removal intensity
   and spatiotemporal complexity of management regime) significantly
   affected both the diversity and the plant species richness at a 1 m(2)
   spatial scale, whereas management type had a significant effect on
   species richness only. With regard to the overall variance in species
   richness, none of the single attributes (without combining with other
   ones) had considerable explanatory power; for making precise
   predictions, all the management attributes must have been considered.
   The ``dichotomous effect{''} of grazing (i.e. both the highest and the
   lowest levels of plant species richness were observed at pastures) could
   be quantitatively explained by the model. Grazing at low or medium
   intensity (less than 0.5 animal unit/ha), with an annually varying
   rotation sequence of pasture units, led to a much higher, whereas
   permanent overgrazing resulted in a much lower, level of plant species
   richness than traditional mowing (conducted once a year during
   midsummer). Generalisation of the proposed model can be used to predict
   the potential overall effect of particular management systems on the
   plant species richness of other grassland types. For the potential
   overall effect of management, a new term has been introduced: the
   diversifying potential. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many habitats in Europe have been managed by grazing for thousands of
   years. However, extensive grazing systems are becoming increasingly rare
   in the region, and there is a lack of understanding of the functioning
   of these systems.
   We carried out 147 structured interviews in 38 landscapes throughout the
   Carpathian Basin, with 3-5 informants/landscape.
   The number of actively grazing cattle, sheep and pigs, their year-round
   habitat use and the proportion of herds actively tended were documented
   for four characteristic historical periods (before, during and after
   socialist cooperatives and after EU Accession). The numbers of grazing
   cattle and sheep had decreased substantially by 2010 (by 71\% and 49\%,
   respectively), while pig grazing almost disappeared by the 1970s. Cattle
   primarily grazed habitats with taller vegetation. Sheep grazed dry
   pastures and stubbles, while pigs were driven into marshes and forests.
   In general, the importance of dry and wet grasslands increased, while
   the significance of marshes, stubble fields, vegetation along linear
   elements, second growth on hay meadows, wood-pastures and forests
   decreased over time. Approximately half of the grazed habitats were not
   typical pasture grasslands, and functioned as supplementary pastures
   during droughts, autumn and winter. The number of habitat types grazed
   per month per site dropped, and herding decreased substantially, in
   particular in the case of cattle and pigs.
   Contributing factors of the economic and social changes of the examined
   period included the collapse of the communist-era legal framework, the
   intensification of livestock husbandry, EU Common Agricultural Policy
   (CAP) regulations, and the rise of a nature conservation ethic.
   We conclude that agricultural policies should take into account the full
   spectrum of habitat types necessary for the effective operation of
   extensive grazing systems. We argue that conservation-oriented extensive
   grazing should use the traditional wisdom of herders but adapted to the
   present situations. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Year-round grazing by cattle and horses has recently become a common
   practice in conservation management in north-western Europe. Though many
   projects claim positive effects on vegetation development, evidence is
   still largely anecdotal. There are no comprehensive regional surveys
   allowing the detection of general patterns beyond single case studies.
   This applies even more to nutrient-poor sites where year-round grazing
   systems were only recently established and concerns about potentially
   negative effects on plant diversity are still prevalent. Hence, this
   study investigates the impacts of year-round grazing on plant species
   richness, species composition, and vegetation structure on nutrient-poor
   sites using a regional multi-site approach. Surveys were carried out at
   five different study sites in the diluvial plain of northwestern Germany
   and the Netherlands comprising sand grasslands, dry grasslands, and
   heathlands. Results show overall positive effects of grazing: Plant
   species richness, the number of endangered plant species, and the
   proportion of open soil were increased significantly. Contrary, green
   biomass, litter cover, vegetation height, and the cover of woody species
   significantly decreased. At grazed sites there were more small,
   light-demanding species than taller, mesophilic species. A distinct
   decrease of ruderal species and an increase of species following a
   competitive strategy was observed at abandoned sites. Based on broad
   regional evidence, we conclude that year-round grazing is a suitable
   tool for the restoration and management of open habitats on
   nutrient-poor sandy sites. Low sward biomass and poor nutritional
   quality raise, however, concerns about adequate fodder supply and animal
   welfare. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pastoralists on Eurasian rangeland often believe that traditional
   management practices involving moderate rotational grazing ensure
   sustainable yield, increase plant digestibility and promote
   biodiversity. To assess the generality of these suppositions we compared
   biomass production, community leaf C, N and P stoichiometry, leaf trait
   diversity and carbon and nutrient pools in root and soil for moderately
   grazed vs. ungrazed plots in Tibetan alpine meadows. We used five leaf
   traits (leaf C, leaf N and leaf P concentrations; SLA: specific leaf
   area, and LDMC: leaf dry matter content) as indicators of plant
   digestibility and rangeland quality. We measured these foliar traits and
   the ramet numbers for component species in moderately grazed plots as
   well as in exclosures (3-11 years) at five sites across the
   Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Community weighted mean (CWM) trait values and
   functional dispersion (FDis) were used to quantify the mean and the
   variance in the distribution of trait values, respectively. Both the
   leaf P-CWM and leaf P-FDis generally increased under grazing and the
   LDMCCWM decreased, leading to improved plant digestibility and rangeland
   quality (e.g. high, community-wide leaf nutrients). The leaf C-CWM, leaf
   N-CWM and SLA(CWM) increased under grazing but the FDis of these traits
   tended to decrease. Grazing generally increased species diversity but
   decreased aboveground biomass, organic carbon, and nutrient
   concentrations in soil and root, especially decreasing root nitrogen and
   soil available phosphorus. Both root biomass and the leaf C:N (CWM)
   decreased in grazed plots at wet sites, but increased at dry sites. The
   community-wide increase and greater interspecific diversity in leaf
   nutrient concentrations coupled with decreasing LDMCCWM show that
   grazing induced an increase in plant digestibility, nutrient
   concentrations, and nutrient diversity in these alpine meadows. However,
   this increase in forage quality comes at the cost of losses in both
   carbon stock and nutrient availability that depress biomass production.
   Our findings and a review of related literature suggest that traditional
   grazing practices involve a trade-off between short-term yield and
   sustainability, a management challenge that must be addressed on
   rangelands with low soil fertility. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Grazing at low stocking rates is often recommended for the preservation
   of the characteristic biodiversity of open landscapes. However, the
   fine-tuning of grazing management still lacks a good evidence base. This
   is particularly true for insect communities, as available evidence
   indicates that these are more vulnerable to grazing than plant
   communities. The outcome, however, may be expected to differ between
   insect species. Here, we analysed the impact of different grazing
   intensities on insect communities from lowland heathlands in the
   Netherlands. Firstly, we use detailed data on butterfly distribution and
   abundances to analyse population responses of 10 butterfly species to
   heathland grazing management. Secondly, we investigated species
   responses to grazing intensity on 16 field locations across a range of
   insect groups (butterflies, day-active moths, grasshoppers, and ants).
   We hypothesized that species from early successional stages would
   benefit from grazing whereas late-successional species would suffer from
   grazing. Moreover, we expected summer grazing to have less beneficial
   effects than year-round grazing. Both hypotheses were largely supported
   by our results. Species responses to grazing contrasted between early
   and late successional species. Variation in species responses were
   strongly linked to grazing intensity and soil moisture, reflecting
   species-specific niches in relation to vegetation structure and
   microclimate. We conclude that low-intensity year-round cattle grazing
   or herded sheep grazing may promote insect biodiversity in large,
   heterogeneous heathlands, whereas targeted or rotational grazing may be
   advisable in smaller areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Wetland loss is a global concern because wetlands are highly diverse
   ecosystems that provide important goods and services, thus threatening
   both biodiversity and human well-being. The Parana River Delta is one of
   the largest and most important wetland ecosystems of South America,
   undergoing expanding cattle and forestry activities with widespread
   water control practices. To understand the patterns and drivers of land
   cover change in the Lower Parana River Delta, we quantified land cover
   changes and modeled associated factors. We developed land cover maps
   using Landsat images from 1999 and 2013 and identified main land cover
   changes. We quantified the influence of different socioeconomic
   (distance to roads, population centers and human activity centers), land
   management (area within polders, cattle density and years since last
   fire), biophysical variables (landscape unit, elevation, soil
   productivity, distance to rivers) and variables related to extreme
   system dynamics (flooding and fires) on freshwater marsh conversion with
   Boosted Regression Trees. We found that one third of the freshwater
   marshes of the Lower Delta (163,000 ha) were replaced by pastures (70\%)
   and forestry (18\%) in only 14 years. Ranching practices (represented by
   cattle density, area within polders and distance to roads) were the most
   important factors responsible for freshwater marsh conversion to
   pasture. These rapid and widespread losses of freshwater marshes have
   potentially large negative consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem
   services. A strategy for sustainable wetland management will benefit
   from careful analysis of dominant land uses and related management
   practices, to develop an urgently needed land use policy for the Lower
   Delta. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In many cultural landscapes, the abandonment of traditional grazing
   leads to encroachment of pastures by woody plants, which reduces habitat
   heterogeneity and impacts biodiversity typical of semi-open habitats. We
   developed a framework of mutually interacting spatial models to locate
   areas where shrub encroachment in Alpine treeline ecosystems
   deteriorates vulnerable species' habitat, using black grouse Tetrao
   tetrix (L.) in the Swiss Alps as a study model. Combining field
   observations and remote-sensing information we 1) identified and located
   the six predominant treeline vegetation types; 2) modelled current black
   grouse breeding habitat as a function thereof so as to derive optimal
   habitat profiles; 3) simulated from these profiles the theoretical
   spatial extension of breeding habitat when assuming optimal vegetation
   conditions throughout; and used the discrepancy between (2) and (3) to
   4) locate major aggregations of homogeneous shrub vegetation in
   otherwise suitable breeding habitat as priority sites for habitat
   restoration. All six vegetation types (alpine pasture, coniferous
   forest, Alnus viridis (Chaix), Rhododendron-dominated,
   Juniperus-dominated and mixed heathland) were predicted with high
   accuracy (AUC > 0.9). Breeding black grouse preferred a heterogeneous
   mosaic of vegetation types, with none exceeding 50\% cover. While 15\%
   of the timberline belt currently offered suitable breeding habitat,
   twice that fraction (29\%) would potentially be suitable when assuming
   optimal shrub and ground vegetation conditions throughout the study
   area. Yet, only 10\% of this difference was attributed to habitat
   deterioration by shrub-encroachment of dense heathland (all types 5.2\%)
   and Alnus viridis (4.8\%). The presented method provides both a general,
   large-scale assessment of areas covered by dense shrub vegetation as
   well as specific target values and priority areas for habitat
   restoration related to a selected target organism. This facilitates
   optimizing the spatial allocation of management resources in geographic
   regions where shrub encroachment represents a major biodiversity
   conservation issue.}},

   projects. There is therefore an urgent need to investigate environmental
   factors and habitat factors that affect bird species richness in order
   to optimise management of those areas set aside for conservation. A
   particularly good opportunity to study these issues arose at Ingula in
   the eastern South African high-altitude grasslands. An area that had
   been subject to intense grazing was bought by the national power utility
   that constructed a pumped storage scheme on part of the land and set
   aside the rest for bird conservation. Since the new management took over
   in 2005 the area has been mostly annually burned with relatively little
   grazing. The new management seeks scientific advice on how to maintain
   avian species richness of the study area. We collected bird occurrence
   and vegetation data along random transects between 2006 and 2010 to
   monitor the impact of the new management, and to study the effect of the
   habitat changes on bird species richness. To achieve these, we convert
   bird transect data to presence only data to investigate how bird species
   richness were related to key transect vegetation attributes under this
   new grassland management. First we used generalised linear mixed models,
   to examine changes in vegetation grass height and cover and between
   burned and unburned habitats. Secondly, we examined how total bird
   species richness varied across seasons and years. And finally we
   investigated which habitat vegetation attributes were correlated with
   species richness of a group of grassland depended bird species only.
   Transects that were burned showed a larger decrease in vegetation cover
   compared to transects that were not burned. Grass height increased over
   time. Bird species richness was highest in summer compared to other
   seasons and increased over time. Overall bird species richness increased
   over the three summer surveys but species richness of birds that prefer
   heavily grazed habitat showed little change over the three years.
   Changes in bird species richness were best explained by the model with
   grass height for combined species richness of grassland depended birds
   but also for birds that prefer heavy grazing when treated alone. On one
   hand birds that prefer moderate grazing were best explained by a null
   model. However, overall bird species richness was better positively
   correlated to grass height than grass cover or dead grass. We conclude
   that frequent burning alone with relatively reduced grazing led to
   higher but less dense grass, which benefited some species and
   disadvantaged others. We suggest that management of this grassland use
   combination of fire and grazing and leave some areas unburned to
   accommodates birds of various habitat needs.}},

Abstract = {{Pastoralists claim that traditional management practices involving light
   to moderate grazing ensure sustainable yield and promote the
   multifunctional services provided by rangeland ecosystems. Nectar
   production is a key ecosystem function crucial to successful apiculture
   and to the sustainability of services provided by pollinators in the
   Tibetan alpine rangeland. Here, we evaluated whether traditional (light
   to moderate) grazing promotes plant biodiversity and nectar production
   at the level of individual plants and at the level of an entire
   community. We compared plant species diversity and nectar production of
   the dominant nectariferous species (Saussurea nigrescens) at the
   individual plant level and at the community level in ungrazed, lightly
   grazed, moderately grazed, and heavily grazed plots in each of three
   Tibetan alpine meadow sites. Individual nectar production was quantified
   as nectar volume x floret number per capitulum x capitulum per plant.
   Community nectar production was calculated as individual nectar
   production x the number of flowering plants per 1.0 m(2) plot. We found
   that nectar production at the floret, individual, and community levels
   was significantly higher in lightly and moderately grazed plots compared
   to heavily grazed or ungrazed plots. This somewhat counterintuitive
   observation (particularly with regard to ungrazed plots) resulted from
   the fact that light and moderate grazing increased floret and capitulum
   number, and the number of flowering individuals per plot as a result of
   lowered competition for light. Moreover, species richness was
   significantly correlated with nectar production (as a result of light to
   moderate grazing) both at the individual level and at the community
   level. These results support the traditional view that light to moderate
   grazing not only promotes plant biodiversity but also ensures a
   sustainable yield in nectar production (and forage). Thus, traditional
   grazing management practices are more ``eco-friendly{''} compared to
   recent and widespread practices involving either grazing exclusion or
   overgrazing in the Tibetan rangelands examined in this study. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Grasslands are among the most imperiled ecosystems in the world, and
   establishment of exotic forage grasses and management for uniform
   utilization may have contributed to population declines of many obligate
   grassland bird species in North America. Native warm-season grasses
   (NWSG) are increasingly promoted as viable alternatives to exotic
   forages currently in production such as bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon)
   and tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus), but structure of native
   bunchgrasses also may offer nesting habitat for birds such as the
   dickcissel (Spiza americana). Establishing NWSG pastures may thereby
   create an opportunity for land-sharing, where agriculture incorporates
   biodiversity-friendly practices. We investigated diciccissel responses
   to NWSG and grazing at the Prairie Research Unit in Monroe Co.,
   Mississippi (USA), where we established a gradient of management
   intensity among four treatments in small, operational-scale pastures
   (6.4-10.5 ha). Treatments included grazed exotic forages, two grazed
   NWSG treatments including Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans) monoculture
   and grazed mixed NWSG polyculture of Indian grass, little bluestem
   (Schizachyrium scoparium), and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii), and a
   non-grazed NWSG polyculture treatment. We applied a multi-state capture
   recapture model in a Bayesian framework to estimate dickcissel nest
   density and productivity while accounting for nest stage-specific
   variation in survival and detection. Nest density and productivity were
   consistently greater in non-grazed NWSG than grazed exotic pasture,
   whereas productivity in grazed NWSG treatments was intermediate but
   declined between years. We also found that variation in survival and
   density did not always correspond with estimated productivity, and thus
   solely relying on either parameter may be misleading when making
   inferences on habitat quality. These results suggest a positive response
   to NWSG among dickcissels in this system, but grazing may reduce nest
   site abundance, and consequently productivity. Native warm-season
   forages may be a viable land-sharing alternative by increasing
   productivity of tall structure specialists such as dickcissels compared
   with exotic grass pastures currently in production, but grazing should
   be managed to ensure abundance of tall vegetation structure for nest
   sites. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Microhabitat heterogeneity promotes soil fertility and ground-dwelling
   arthropod diversity in Mediterranean wood-pastures}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{233}},
Pages = {{192-201}},
Month = {{OCT 3}},
Abstract = {{Mediterranean wood-pastures are extensive agroforestry systems that hold
   great ecological, social and cultural values, which consist of mixtures
   of grassland, scattered trees and shrubs, primarily used for livestock
   grazing. For centuries, low-intensity management in these landscapes has
   resulted in multiple microhabitats that favour biodiversity and are
   considered key elements for the long-term persistence of wood-pastures.
   However, the relative contribution of each microhabitat type to
   wood-pasture biodiversity and functioning remains poorly studied. We
   investigated the impact that different wood-pasture microhabitats have
   on soil chemical fertility and the decomposition food web. We analysed
   the two main microhabitats that make wood-pastures up - open grasslands
   and isolated trees and three additional ``litter-trapping{''}
   microhabitats - shrubs scattered in the grassland matrix, canopied
   shrubs and piles of pruning debris in terms of soil chemical properties
   (organic matter content, total N, C:N ratio, available P, and
   exchangeable base cations), collembolan and dipteran (mostly
   detritivores) abundance, and carabid (seed-eaters and predators) and
   staphylinid (mostly predators) beetle abundance, body size, biomass,
   species richness and composition. Grasslands were the most different
   microhabitats, with the lowest soil nutrient content and particular
   carabid and staphylinid species composition. Trees had the highest soil
   fertility levels and abundance of Diptera and staphylinids, and held
   unique staphylinid assemblages. ``Litter-trapping{''} microhabitats had
   medium to high soil nutrient values and shared a distinct staphylinid
   assemblage compared to grasslands and trees. Besides, scattered shrubs
   provided shelter for large-sized carabid and staphylinid predators,
   while canopied shrubs held the highest carabid abundance and biomass.
   ``Litter-trapping{''} microhabitats retained tree leaves that would
   otherwise be lost to the wood-pasture, recovering nutrients to the
   system, and provided new habitat, shelter and food for detritivores and
   unique predator assemblages. ``Litter-trapping{''} microhabitats thus
   enhanced soil fertility and the decomposition process, at the same time
   as increased the abundance and diversity of the communities of
   ground-dwelling detritivores and predators inhabiting wood-pastures.
   These findings confirmed that microhabitat heterogeneity resulting from
   low-intensity management is essential to maintain both the primary
   production and the biodiversity conservation value of wood pastures. (C)
