Abstract = {{The effect of experimental livestock grazing regimens (4 treatments x 6
   replicates) on spiders via habitat structure and prey abundance was
   investigated on sub-montane habitats in the Southern Highlands of
   Scotland. The study, 2002-2004 included a baseline survey under the
   prior, commercial sheep grazing regimen and two assessments of spider
   assemblages post-treatment: commercial stocking density of sheep; 1/3
   stocking density with sheep; 1/3 stocking density cattle with sheep; and
   no grazing. Spiders were sampled with a suction sampler, five sucks at
   each of 25 sample units by 24 plots (600 samples in 2003 and 2004, ca.
   320 in 2002). Spider abundance and species richness increased under
   reduced stocking density, mixed herbivore and ungrazed treatments
   indirectly via changes in vegetation structure and prey abundance. The
   results refuted a meta-analysis that concluded species richness of
   spiders is unaffected by grazing. Grazing regimens caused turnover in
   species composition more than the net difference in species richness
   suggested, implying that no single, optimal grazing regimen will support
   as many species as a patchwork under varied grazing management.
   Conservation grazing benefits spiders and will have significant benefits
   for food webs in sub-montane ecosystems but the period to equilibrium
   after changes to grazing requires further investigation. (C) 2015 The

Title = {{Alien and native plant species play different roles in plant community

Abstract = {{1. Although impacts of alien plants on species richness are widely
   reported, it remains unclear how common such effects might be and
   whether they differ from those due to native species. To date, too few
   studies have examined the impacts of a wide enough spectrum of native
   and alien species to address the importance of geographic origin on the
   richness of plant communities.
   2. We investigated how total plant species richness, as well as its
   separate alien and native components, varied with the abundance of 115
   alien and 146 native plant species across Banks Peninsula in New
   Zealand. Using null models, we tested whether significant correlations
   between the abundance of each focal species and species richness were
   more frequent than expected by chance. Examination of the differences in
   the relationships with species abundance found for native and alien
   richness can shed light as to whether alien species might be acting as
   drivers of biodiversity change or passengers responding to external
   environmental factors.
   3. Significant relationships were rarely found for total richness due to
   contrasting trends of native and alien richness with species abundance.
   In contrast to natives, an increase in the abundance of an alien species
   revealed more frequent negative relationships with native richness and
   positive correlations with alien richness.
   4. The relationship with species abundance found for native and alien
   components of richness differed between grasslands and woodlands. While
   we found putative support for negative impacts on native richness for
   several alien species in grasslands, the similar negative correlations
   in woodlands were more likely to reflect the shade intolerance of alien
   grasses where native species richness was high.
   5. Synthesis. Our analyses reveal that widespread alien and native
   species play different roles in the plant communities in which they
   co-occur. Separately analysing the relationship with species abundance
   for alien and native components of richness can help distinguish between
   situations where aliens may be acting as the primary drivers in plant
   community changes or simply passengers. This is an essential first step
   in designing further experimental studies to determine the underlying
   ecological processes and potential ecosystem impacts of alien species.}},

Title = {{Patterns of livestock activity on heterogeneous subalpine pastures
   reveal distinct responses to spatial autocorrelation, environment and
   management}},
Journal = {{MOVEMENT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Background: In order to understand the impact of grazing livestock on
   pasture ecosystems, it is essential to quantify pasture use intensity at
   a fine spatial scale and the factors influencing its distribution. The
   observation and analysis of animal activity is greatly facilitated by
   remote tracking technology and new statistical frameworks allowing for
   rapid inference on spatially correlated data. We used these advances to
   study activity patterns of GPS-tracked cows in six summer-grazing areas
   in the Swiss Alps that differed in environmental conditions as well as
   livestock management.
   Results: Recorded GPS positions were assigned to the activities of
   grazing, resting, and walking, and were discretized on a regular grid.
   Regression models with spatially structured effects were fitted to the
   spatial activity patterns using Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation.
   They indicated that terrain slope, forage quality, and stocking rate
   were the primary factors determining cow activity in the six study
   areas. Terrain slope significantly reduced livestock activity in five of
   the six areas and sparse forage availability significantly reduced
   grazing in all areas. In three areas, grazing pressure imposed by the
   pasture rotation was observable in the grazing pattern. Insolation,
   distance to the shed, and distance to water were less important for cow
   activity. In addition to the main factors identified across all study
   areas, we found effects operating only in individual areas, which were
   partly explained by specific environmental and management
   characteristics. In study areas with few paddocks, environmental
   variables exerted a stronger control on livestock activity than in areas
   with a short stocking period per paddock.
   Conclusions: The data demonstrated that a strict pasture rotation with
   short stocking periods is necessary to influence livestock activity, and
   hence potential effects on ecosystem processes. Without grazing
   management, livestock activity is primarily determined by the
   environment. Such insight is indispensable for studying relationships
   between grazing animals and ecosystem characteristics, and for
   developing management strategies to optimize ecosystem services. The
   analysis also highlighted the need for an appropriate statistical
   treatment of bio-logging data, since various estimates were biased if
   spatial autocorrelation was ignored.}},

Abstract = {{In the Transylvanian region, the Aries Valley stretches along the course
   of the Aries River, ending as tributary of Mure River. As well as these
   areas of great biodiversity value, the Aries Valley (drainage area of
   2,540 km(2)) also crosses the region where local people set their
   villages and towns and use the surrounding areas as grasslands for
   grazing, mowing and fields for agriculture. The grassland types are
   present in patches, those used for hay production are scattered among
   agricultural fields and human settlements.
   Evidence from statistical analysis of the vegetation cover of a riparian
   area of Aries River Valley indicates that in the inventorying plots with
   low species diversity, there is a dominance of one or two species with
   individuals unequally distributed within and between plots. The layer
   1-5 m is dominated by alien invasive species: Fallopia japonica,
   Helianthus tuberosus, Impatiens glanduligera, the studied area of Aries
   River Valley becoming a source for these alien species to invade the
   surrounding grasslands and agricultural fields. Especially Fallopia
   japonica individuals form compact patches invading the pastures and
   agricultural fields and the local farmers cannot use the land any more
   for fulfilling their own needs. The invasive species replace the native
   species from the grasslands and make the agricultural field
   inappropriate for crops cultivation. The river acts as a migration
   corridor for the alien species helping them to spread by seeds or
   fragments and invade new places, especially during spring and/or autumn
   floods, and a contamination source for the surrounding grasslands and
   agricultural fields.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Humans are altering land use and impacting grazing
   intensities worldwide in alpine and sub-alpine grasslands, and
   functional diversity (FD) is a useful tool for predicting changes in
   these grassland communities and for improving biodiversity conservation.
   We asked: (1) how does functional richness (FRic) differ between the
   five predominant grassland types in Andorra (2) of these five grassland
   types, which plant communities are subject to high habitat filtering and
   which are driven primarily by competitive interactions; (3) are certain
   grassland communities more prone to degradation than others; and (4) how
   do grazing intensity and elevation influence variations in FD indices?
   Locations: Five types of sub-alpine and alpine grassland communities
   dominated by Festuca airoides, F.eskia, F.gautieri, F.paniculata and
   Nardus stricta in Andorra, at various elevations and with differing
   grazing intensities within a grassland type.
   Methods: We used multiple functional diversity indices and structural
   equation modelling (SEM) to determine how grazing intensity, elevation,
   species richness and productivity affect functional diversity in 222
   vegetation transects.
   Results: Both plant diversity and functional richness were higher at
   higher grazing intensities, with the highest values found in the
   F.gautieri and F.paniculata grasslands and lowest in the Nardus stricta,
   F.airoides and F.eskia grasslands. Habitat filtering was observed in
   F.airoides grasslands. There was a general tendency for higher
   competitive interactions among plants at higher elevations and/or when
   species diversity increased. None of the five grassland communities
   considered appears disturbed, and all present similar functional
   attributes between dominant species.
   Conclusions: Our results highlight the fact that grazing is an integral
   part of Andorran mountain grasslands, acting as a structural component
   and providing higher functional richness in the most grazed communities.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{104-119}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Physiological diversification reflects adaptation for specific
   environmental challenges. As the major physiological process that
   provides plants with carbon and energy, photosynthesis is under strong
   evolutionary selection that gives rise to variability in nearly all
   parts of the photosynthetic apparatus. Here, we discuss how plants,
   notably those using C-4 photosynthesis, diversified in response to
   environmental challenges imposed by declining atmospheric CO2 content in
   recent geological time. This reduction in atmospheric CO2 increases the
   rate of photorespiration and reduces photosynthetic efficiency. While
   plants have evolved numerous mechanisms to compensate for low CO2, the
   most effective are the carbon concentration mechanisms of C-4, C-2, and
   CAM photosynthesis; and the pumping of dissolved inorganic carbon,
   mainly by algae. C-4 photosynthesis enables plants to dominate warm, dry
   and often salinized habitats, and to colonize areas that are too
   stressful for most plant groups. Because C-4 lineages generally lack
   arborescence, they cannot form forests. Hence, where they predominate,
   C-4 plants create a different landscape than would occur if C-3 plants
   were to predominate. These landscapes (mostly grasslands and savannahs)
   present unique selection environments that promoted the diversification
   of animal guilds able to graze upon the C-4 vegetation. Thus, the rise
   of C-4 photosynthesis has made a significant contribution to the origin
   of numerous biomes in the modern biosphere. (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {{Large mammalian grazers can alter the biotic and abiotic features of
   their environment through their impacts on vegetation. Grazing at
   moderate intensity has been recommended for biodiversity conservation.
   Few studies, however, have empirically tested the benefits of moderate
   grazing intensity in systems dominated by native grazers. Here we
   investigated the relationship between (1) density of native eastern grey
   kangaroos, Macropus giganteus, and grass structure, and (2) grass
   structure and reptiles (i.e. abundance, richness, diversity and
   occurrence) across 18 grassland and grassy Eucalyptus woodland
   properties in south-eastern Australia. There was a strong negative
   relationship between kangaroo density and grass structure after
   controlling for tree canopy cover. We therefore used grass structure as
   a surrogate for grazing intensity. Changes in grazing intensity (i.e.
   grass structure) significantly affected reptile abundance, reptile
   species richness, reptile species diversity, and the occurrence of
   several ground-dwelling reptiles. Reptile abundance, species richness
   and diversity were highest where grazing intensity was low. Importantly,
   no species of reptile was more likely to occur at high grazing
   intensities. Legless lizards (Delma impar, D. inornata) were more likely
   to be detected in areas subject to moderate grazing intensity, whereas
   one species (Hemiergis talbingoensis) was less likely to be detected in
   areas subject to intense grazing and three species (Menetia greyii,

   affected by grazing intensity. Our data indicate that to maximize
   reptile abundance, species richness, species diversity, and occurrence
   of several individual species of reptile, managers will need to subject
   different areas of the landscape to moderate and low grazing intensities
   and limit the occurrence and extent of high grazing.}},

Abstract = {{An important question in ecology is whether the food-web structure and
   ecosystem functions are related. This paper provide an empirical
   evidence for the food-web complexity-ecosystem properties relationships
   using the comparative analysis of food webs in seven mountain pastoral
   grasslands located in the Carpathian Mountain area of the Chernivtsi
   Region, Ukraine. Biomass of plant functional groups; grazing intensity;
   richness of different functional groups of the soil microorganisms; and
   geographical location of the study grasslands are observed ecosystem
   properties. Trophic networks consisting of N food and feeding categories
   (nodes, compartments) joined by L food transfers (links) were
   constructed for each studied pasture and the following network measures
   of their graph characteristics ({''}topology{''}) determined: food-web
   size (N), number of links (L), link density (LD = L/N), and connectance
   (C= L/N-2). Also the number of trophic classes and size of each trophic
   class are incorporated as the properties of the food-web architecture.
   Our data reveal that increase in species richness and food-web
   complexity increases the biomass of forbs within the study grasslands.
   Grazing intensity shows negative but statistically insignificant
   correlation with network measures. Our findings also reveal the
   longitudinal changes in connectance variation across the study food
   webs. It shows that temperature and elevation changes may also
   contribute toward the food-web connectance variation within the study
   area. Overall, our findings report plants to be the defining in network
   architecture. Furthermore grazing-susceptible plants show to be the
   driving variable in a food-web structure of the study grasslands. Our
   findings also reveal new aspects in behavioral patterns of food-web
   properties in relation to each other. Our data report link density to be
   the most sensitive parameter in relation to the other food-web measures.
   In contrast, connectance shows the least sensitivity to all other
   network measures, but the most sensitivity to the observed ecosystem
   parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The vegetation of Ponor Mt. has not been studied systematically. Being a
   part of the national Natura 2000 network, this region deserves special
   attention regarding the knowledge of biodiversity. The recent study was
   conducted during 2007-2010. Herbaceous vegetation was sampled and a
   total of 214 releves were collected. They. were analysed by divisive
   classification methods. Six classes, 11 alliances, 13 associations and 4
   subassociations were distinguished within Ponor Special Protection Area.
   Dry grasslands of the Festuco-Brometea class are widespread. Restricted
   areas mostly in the pot-holes are occupied by communities of
   Scheuchzerio-Caricetea fuscae. Hay meadows classified within
   Arrhenatheretalia are situated close to the villages. Decreased grazing
   and mowing intensity appears to be the main threat for biodiversity in
   grasslands. Over the last decade, due to the significant reduction in
   grazing intensity, large areas covered by grasslands were converted into
   scrublands.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Today, native vegetation in the Valdivian Coastal Range (VCR) is
   restricted to areas where small-scale land use dominates resulting in a
   vegetation mosaic. This study (1) provides a description of the
   vegetation types (VT) within the vegetation mosaic, (2) identifies land
   use drivers that lead to either degradation or recovery processes and,
   (3) attempts to provide an explanation for the vegetation mosaic with a
   conceptual model. In two regions of the VCR we sampled 102 plots for
   composition of vegetation and indicators of livestock browsing, timber
   cutting and coppice forestry. We classified the vegetation using a
   flexible beta method and Bray-Curtis distance. Diagnostic species were
   identified by an extended indicator species analysis. The clustering
   results were visualized in NMDS and recursive partitioning was used to
   explain variations in the VTs as a function of the land use variables.
   Differentiating effects were tested using PERMANOVA and a conceptual
   model for the vegetation dynamics was developed from the results. Four
   VTs such as (1) extensively grazed non-native grasslands (EGN); (2),
   closed and semi-closed grazed Ugni and Berberis shrublands; (3) severely
   impacted evergreen forests; and (4) sparsely disturbed evergreen forests
   were recognized. The browsing indicators were important for
   differentiating the VTs. The EGN grasslands were differentiated by
   having more than 0.075 dung piles/m(2). Areas with fewer dung piles but
   direct browsing effects had the greatest impact on vegetation. Forests
   were preserved when the mean browsing index was equal to or lower than
   0.5. The cutting frequency was significant in determining overall
   floristic composition. We showed that shrublands and evergreen forests
   within the vegetation mosaic and the result of small-scale farming led
   to high native forest species richness. This makes the vegetation mosaic
   especially valuable in a landscape dominated by exotic tree
   monocultures.}},

Abstract = {{Alpine grasslands harbour species-rich communities of plants and
   invertebrates. We examined how environmental variables and anthropogenic
   impact shape species richness and community structure of terrestrial
   gastropods in alpine grasslands in the Val Mustair (Eastern Alps,
   Switzerland). Gastropods were sampled using a standardised method at 76
   sites spanning an elevation range from 1430 m to 2770 m. A total of 4763
   specimens representing 52 species were recorded. Correspondence analysis
   based on presence/absence data revealed that the grassland gastropod
   community was structured in a complex way with elevation, wetness,
   grazing intensity and inclination of the sites as key factors, while
   abundance-based analysis identified the importance of the elevation and
   wetness of sites. Generalized linear model showed that species richness
   decreased with increasing elevation and increased with increasing soil
   pH. The grassland gastropod communities were characterized by a high
   beta diversity, as indicated by the SDR-simplex analysis.
   Species-specific traits of gastropods showed sensitivity to the

Abstract = {{The field cricket Gryllus campestris used to be very common throughout
   Europe, but in recent decades its population has declined. We study
   ecology and behavior of crickets near the Odolanow, Poland, between 2009
   - 2011, with emphasis on the effects of grazing of cattle and horses on
   insects population. We compared the number of burrows per square meter
   on both grazed and non-grazed areas and examined the size of the arena
   in front of the burrow. We hypothesized that juvenile crickets would
   have smaller arenas in front of the burrows compared to adults. We also
   hypothesized that crickets would prefer burrows with entrances facing
   southwards. We found that: (1) the number of burrows in area grazed by
   cattle and horses was higher compared to non-grazed areas; (2) there was
   the interindividual variation in arena size in front of the burrows,
   with adult insects having bigger arenas in comparison to the arenas of
   the young; (3) there was diversity in geographical direction of the
   burrow entrance with the south being the preferred one. We propose that
   grazing may have a positive impact on biodiversity of meadows biocenosis
   and is important for the protection of the field cricket populations.}},

Abstract = {{The aims of this paper were (i) to define how contrasting land uses
   affected plant biodiversity in Mediterranean agro-silvo-pastoral-systems
   across a gradient of disturbance regimes: cork oak forests, secondary
   grasslands, hay crops, grass covered vineyards, tilled vineyards; (ii)
   to determine whether these patterns mirrored those of below-ground
   microorganisms and whether the components of gamma-diversity followed a
   similar model. The disturbance regimes affected plant assemblage
   composition. Species richness decreased with increasing land use
   intensity, the Shannon index showed the highest values in grasslands and
   hay crops. Plant assemblage composition patterns mirrored those of
   Basidiomycota and Ascomycota. Richness in Basidiomycota, denitrifying
   bacteria and microbial biomass showed the same trend as that observed
   for vascular plant richness. The Shannon index pattern of below-ground
   microorganisms was different from that of plants. The plant
   gamma-diversity component model weakly mirrored those of Ascomycota.
   Patchy diversity patterns suggest that the maintenance of contrasting
   land uses associated with different productions typical of
   agro-silvo-pastoral-systems can guarantee the conservation of
   biodiversity. (C) 2014 Academie des sciences. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{As widely recognized, bush encroachment on mire meadows induces species
   and habitat biodiversity. However, it is unclear if expansion of either
   a coherent, continuous forest or randomly distributed groups of trees,
   so-called tree isles, in formerly open landscapes of mire meadows
   influences differently the water balance of the system due to changing
   vegetation structure, landscape, and thus evapotranspiration. In this
   paper we use a quasi-3D unsaturated saturated groundwater flow model to
   reveal the feedback between the actual evapotranspiration and diurnal
   phreatic groundwater level dynamics. A schematized numerical experiment
   was setup to elucidate the ecohydrological functioning of mire meadows
   in the Biebrza Valley (NE Poland), which have been influenced by bush
   encroachment due to abandonment of mowing. Model calibration and
   validation was based on field collected data on groundwater dynamics
   showing the feedback between the evapotranspiration and diurnal
   groundwater level fluctuations. The model was applied for different
   landscape compositions of encroachments as well as different stages of
   shrubby vegetation expansion in a formerly open meadow. It is concluded
   that for coupled unsaturated saturated flow models of mires, analysis of
   diurnal groundwater level fluctuations combined with evapotranspiration
   quantification is an efficient yet simple method for model calibration
   and validation. Results of the modelling experiment indicated that the
   tree-isle-type of bush encroachment entails higher losses of water from
   the system due to evapotranspiration than coherent forest expansion. For
   a hypothetical summer drought and an encroachment cover of 50\% the
   total evapotranspiration is shown to be 13\% higher for the
   tree-isle-type encroachment than for expansion of a coherent forest.
   Consequently, it is concluded that conservation of mires requires
   continuous control of encroachment not only because of potential loss of
   biodiversity, but more importantly to limit significant loss of water
   due to increased evapotranspiration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Montane meadows provide multiple ecological and economic benefits, and
   are widely considered areas of high conservation value. There is growing
   interest in balancing multiple land-uses on these and other focal
   working landscapes to provide for economic, social, and conservation
   goals. Globally, livestock grazing has been used as a management and
   conservation tool in many ecosystems; however, there is substantial
   concern-particularly for montane meadows-that grazing negatively impacts
   ecosystem functions and services. The mechanisms by which excessive
   livestock grazing can degrade meadow function have been well documented;
   yet, for hydrologically functional meadow systems, we know little about
   meadow-scale linkages in the hydrologic-soil-plant-grazing animal
   continuum, which limits our ability to develop riparian grazing
   conservation strategies. We conducted a cross-sectional, observational
   survey of hydrology, soils, plant communities, and cattle forage
   resource use across 24 functional montane meadows of the central Sierra
   Nevada Mountain Range in California, USA. By linking principles of plant
   community ecology and foraging theory, we were able to unravel
   relationships and drivers between hydropedologic conditions, plant
   community characteristics, and cattle grazing patterns. Our work
   demonstrates that hydrology is a critical driving factor of cattle
   foraging response, plant community attributes, and soil properties
   across these wetland ecosystems. Results indicate that these systems are
   resilient to the observed gradient of grazing disturbances. This
   information advances our understanding of how meadow-scale heterogeneity
   can be utilized in managing for multiple, and potentially conflicting,
   ecosystem services across working landscapes-particularly in the face of
   projected future climate changes and continually limited resources to
   support conservation and restoration projects.}},

Title = {{Ground beetle community in suburban Satoyama - A case study on wing type

Abstract = {{A Satoyama landscape is an important reservoir of biodiversity; however,
   in post-industrial era traditional Satoyama management became
   economically unfeasible.
   To maintain Satoyama, labor-saving management styles have begun to be
   implemented. In contrast to the traditional styles based on
   labor-intensive practices such as rotational tree clear-cutting, the
   labor-saving styles consist mainly in tree thinning and ground
   vegetation cutting within a small spatial range. The consequences of
   this new approach are unclear, and our study aimed at filling this gap
   in our knowledge by analyzing the effects of small scale management on
   ground beetle community in suburban Satoyama (Kashiwa city, central
   Japan). We applied labor-saving management at limited spatial range, and
   sampled and analyzed ground beetles both before and after management.
   Cluster analysis revealed three groups of beetle assemblages,
   corresponding to three habitats: forest, bamboo stand and grassland.
   Comparison of wing traits showed that, before management, brachypterous
   beetles dominated forest plots and macropterous beetles were more
   prominent in the grassland plot, while in the bamboo stand both types of
   wing morphology were evenly represented. This trend can be linked to
   habitat structural stability driven by vegetation regeneration cycles
   which reflect dominant plant longevity. After management, macroptery
   increased in all three habitats. Probably, habitat disturbance created
   by vegetation management gave advantage to macropterous beetles over
   brachypterous beetles. These results suggest that wing type can be
   linked to vegetation structural stability. In some species, decline in
   abundance was accompanied with decline in body size. Our study shows
   that small scale Satoyama management can have pronounced effects on
   beetle assemblages. (C) 2014 Korean Society of Applied Entomology,

Title = {{Habitat- and rainfall-dependent biodiversity responses to cattle removal

Abstract = {{Biodiversity conservation in rangeland environments is often addressed
   by removing livestock, but inconsistent responses by biota mean that the
   efficacy of this form of management is hotly debated. Reasons for this
   inconsistency include the usually short duration and small spatial scale
   of manipulations compared to the area of grazing properties, as well as
   divergent responses amongst biota. In low-productivity arid
   environments, the pulse-reserve dynamic also complicates the outcome of
   manipulations. Here, we tested and extended these ideas in a
   heterogeneous desert environment in central Australia that consists of
   small patches of open woodland (gidgee) in a grassland (spinifex)
   matrix. Taking advantage of a controlled property-scale removal of
   cattle, and a rain event that stimulated productivity, we first
   quantified differences in the vegetation and small vertebrates of these
   two habitats, and then tracked the diversity, composition, and abundance
   of these biota for 6-19 months post-rain. We predicted that the two
   habitats would differ in the structure, composition, and reproductive
   output of their constituent plant species. We predicted also that the
   effects of cattle removal would interact with these habitat differences,
   with the abundance, richness, and diversity of small mammals and
   reptiles differing across habitats and grazing treatments. As
   anticipated, plant species composition in woodland was distinct from
   that in grassland and varied over time. The effects of cattle removal
   were habitat specific: Plant composition responded to de-stocking in
   woodland, but not in grassland; flowers were more abundant, and
   palatable plant cover also was greater following cessation of grazing
   pressure. The responses of small mammals but not reptiles showed some
   accord with our predictions, varying over time but inconsistently with
   treatment, and perhaps reflected high variability in capture success. We
   conclude that the timing and length of sampling are important when
   evaluating the responses of biota to livestock removal, as is the
   inclusion of all key habitats in the sampling regime.}},

Abstract = {{Shrub encroachment can follow grazing or burning release in paramo
   grasslands. While encroachment decreases herbaceous species richness in
   some grassland systems, the effects of this process on the herbaceous
   community in paramo grasslands are currently unknown. We collected data
   on shrub cover, herbaceous-species cover and species composition in a
   paramo grassland 12 years after release from burning and cattle grazing
   near Zuleta, Ecuador. Topographic and soil measures were also included
   as predictor variables of differences in community composition. Contrary
   to studies in other systems, shrub cover did not have a significant
   effect on herbaceous-species richness, whereas shrub-species richness
   significantly increased with shrub cover. However, shrub cover was
   associated with significant shifts in herbaceous-community composition.
   Most notably, there was an increase in some shade-tolerant forbs and
   tall-statured wetland grasses with increasing shrub cover, and a
   corresponding decrease in some short-statured grasses and early
   successional forbs. These results could indicate that the ameliorative
   effects of shrubs (e.g. frost and wind protection) in harsh alpine
   environments may partially compensate for the expected competitive
   effect of shrubs due to shading.}},

   Impacts on digestion, energy utilisation, and methane emissions}},

Abstract = {{Intensive farming focusing on monoculture grass species to maximise
   forage production has led to a reduction in the extent and diversity of
   species-rich grasslands. However, plant communities with higher species
   number (richness) are a potential strategy for more sustainable
   production and mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Research
   has indicated the need to understand opportunities that forage mixtures
   can offer sustainable ruminant production systems. The objective of the
   two experiments reported here were to evaluate multiple species forage
   mixtures in comparison to ryegrass-dominant pasture, when conserved or
   grazed, on digestion, energy utilisation, N excretion, and methane
   emissions by growing 10-15 month old heifers. Experiment 1 was a 4 x 4
   Latin square design with five week periods. Four forage treatments of:
   (1) ryegrass (control); permanent pasture with perennial ryegrass
   (Lolium perenne); (2) clover; a ryegrass:red clover (Trifolium pratense)
   mixture; (3) trefoil; a ryegrass:birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus)
   mixture; and (4) flowers; a ryegrass:wild flower mixture of
   predominately sorrel (Rumex acetosa), ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum
   vulgare), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and
   ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata), were fed as haylages to four
   dairy heifers. Measurements included digestibility, N excretion, and
   energy utilisation (including methane emissions measured in respiration
   chambers). Experiment 2 used 12 different dairy heifers grazing three of
   the same forage treatments used to make haylage in experiment 1
   (ryegrass, clover and flowers) and methane emissions were estimated
   using the sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer technique. Distribution of
   ryegrass to other species (dry matter (DM) basis) was approximately
   70:30 (clover), 80:20 (trefoil), and 40:60 (flowers) for experiment 1.
   During the first and second grazing rotations (respectively) in
   experiment 2, perennial ryegrass accounted for 95 and 98\% of DM in
   ryegrass, and 84 and 52\% of DM in clover, with red clover accounting
   for almost all of the remainder. In the flowers mixture, perennial
   ryegrass was 52\% of the DM in the first grazing rotation and only 30\%
   in the second, with a variety of other flower species occupying the
   remainder. Across both experiments, compared to the forage mixtures
   (clover, trefoil and flowers), ryegrass had a higher crude protein (CP)
   content (P < 0.001, 187 vs. 115 g kg(-1) DM) and DM intake (P < 0.05,
   9.0 vs. 8.1 kg day(-1)). Heifers in experiment 1 fed ryegrass, compared
   to the forage mixtures, had greater total tract digestibility (g kg(-1))
   of DM (DMD; P < 0.008, 713 vs. 641) and CP (CPD, P < 0.001, 699 vs.
   475), and used more intake energy (\%) for body tissue deposition (P <
   0.05, 2.6 vs. -4.9). For both experiments, heifers fed flowers differed
   the most compared to the ryegrass control for a number of measurements.
   Compared to ryegrass, flowers had 40\% lower CP content (P < 0.001, 113
   vs. 187 g kg(-1)), 18\% lower DMD (P < 0.01, 585 vs. 713 g kg(-1)), 42\%
   lower CPD (P < 0.001, 407 vs. 699 g kg(-1)), and 10\% lower methane
   yield (P < 0.05, 22.6 vs. 25.1 g kg(-1) DM intake). This study has shown
   inclusion of flowers in forage mixtures resulted in a lower CP
   concentration, digestibility and intake. These difference's were due in
   part to sward management and maturity at harvest.
   Further research is needed to determine how best to exploit the
   potential environmental benefits of forage mixtures in sustainable
   ruminant production systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There are no long-term experimental studies dealing with plant community
   responses to trampling. Here we report the results for soil penetration
   resistance and plant species changes in mesotrophic temperate Central
   European grassland after 12-years of grazing management with and without
   trampling by cattle. Five grazing treatments (intensive and extensive
   grazing; cut for hay in June followed by intensive or extensive grazing;
   and intensive grazing with no trampling under permanent electric
   fencing) with two replicate blocks have been applied since 1998. Species
   richness, species composition, sward height,. nutrient availability in
   soil and soil penetration resistance were recorded and evaluated. For
   statistical analysis we used one way ANOVA and RDA with the Monte Carlo
   test. Long term grazing by large herbivores had a significant effect on
   soil penetration resistance with the lowest values in the `not trampled'
   treatment. Legumes, particularly Trifolium repens, and short forbs
   (especially Veronica serpyllifolia) were supported by intensively
   defoliated and trampled treatments, whereas tall forbs (mainly
   Aegopodium podagraria, Hypericum maculatum) prevailed under the
   extensively managed treatments. The cover of tall and short graminoids
   was not dependent on applied treatments. The `not trampled' treatment
   had the highest prevalence of bryophytes (domination of Rhytidiadelphus
   squarrosus) and was also the richest in a number of vascular plant
   species; however, it also had the lowest evenness index. Long-term
   defoliation by grazing animals without trampling does not lead to the
   creation of typical pasture swards. Species forming pasture communities
   are essentially dependent on regular defoliation by grazing and regular
   trampling by hooves, which causes a high degree of soil compaction as
   well as sward disruption. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural Alpine grasslands represent an important Western European
   ecosystem but recent agricultural intensification has substantially
   changed their characteristics. The extent to which this ecosystem may
   have been compromised are quantified using a combination of farm, soil
   and botanical attributes collected for 48 hay-meadows over 2 years in
   the Non Valley (Eastern Italian Alps). Due to the wide range of
   estimated nutrient balances meadow type diversity is high but the trend
   is for the creation of productive but species-poor meadows at the
   expense of low-intensity but species diverse ones. Currently the typical
   Arrhenatherum elatius grasslands are less species-rich and Bromus
   erectus ones, traditionally not fertilized, are now often subject to low
   fertilisation. Yields can be high (up to 10.5 t d.m. ha(-1) year(-1) at
   about 1000 m a.s.l.) but, due to the generally late first cut and low
   cutting frequency, these provided reduced forage quality sometimes
   accompanied by excessively high potassium concentrations. Forage quality
   is not generally sufficient for highly productive dairy cattle, so that
   supplementary feeding is required. Reduced cutting frequency and
   traditional hay-making also limit the efficient removal of nutrient
   inputs with annual surpluses up to 245, 63 and 293 kg ha(-1) for N, P
   and K respectively. The combination of sandy soil texture and sloping
   ground do not favour nutrient retention therefore increasing the
   potential risk for the wider environment. Reducing the trend of genetic
   cattle improvement towards high milk production and replacement of the
   traditional Brown Swiss breed with Friesian Holstein, more efficient
   forage harvesting and higher cutting frequency could greatly improve the
   environmental sustainability of new meadow types. However, biodiversity
   conservation can only be achieved if enough of the extensive grassland
   is maintained coupled with appropriate management of intensive meadows.

Volume = {{123}},

Abstract = {{Fencing with grazing exclusion is an effective grassland restoration and
   management practice used to achieve sustainability of grassland
   ecosystems worldwide. However, how the fencing with grazing exclusion
   affects ecosystem services related to carbon and nitrogen dynamics in
   grassland ecosystems has remained controversial over the past two
   decades. We investigated plant biomass, diversity and function groups,
   as well as soil bulk density, pH, soil carbon and nitrogen contents and
   the carbon/nitrogen ratio within the upper 0-1 m soil layer in fenced
   grassland with grazing exclusion and in grazed grassland on the Loess
   Plateau (China) in 2012 and 2013. We estimated the carbon and nitrogen
   pools of the plants and soils to determine how the grazing exclusion
   affected them. Results showed that soil carbon content in the topsoil,
   plant biomass and diversity, and grasses increased, while bulk density,
   pH and forbs decreased after grazing exclusion. The increases in soil
   carbon content, the cumulative organic carbon pool and the rate of
   change in the cumulative organic carbon pool mainly occurred in the
   upper 20 cm soil layer after 8 years of grazing exclusion. Our study
   suggested that the 8-year grazing exclusion had a great influence on the
   carbon pools, but there were no changes in the soil nitrogen pool.
   Identifying the main factors that affect the carbon and nitrogen
   dynamics after grazing exclusion among the soil and plant properties
   should be given more attention in future studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Land abandonment is a widespread phenomenon in agricultural systems,
   especially in former communist countries of Eastern and South-eastern
   Europe. Moreover, Croatia was affected by acts of war which enhanced the
   depopulation of marginal areas impelling further land abandonment.
   Agricultural landscapes in Croatia are highly parcelled with various
   proportions of forest habitats due to traditional smallholder farming
   systems. Secondary successions as a consequence of land abandonment
   affect farmland birds that are among the most endangered bird species in
   Europe. We examined bird communities along a habitat gradient in
   heterogeneous agricultural landscapes. We used the share of woody
   vegetation cover as a proxy measure for land abandonment that we
   classified in four classes. Our results showed no significant Shannon
   Wiener Index differences of bird communities along the land abandonment
   gradient. However, there were differences in abundances when we examined
   bird guilds such as farmland, forest and ``other{''} birds separately.
   However, the conservation value of each of the four land abandonment
   classes did not show significant differences. We extracted single bird
   species such as the Yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella), Red-backed
   Shrike (Lanius collurio), Song Thrush (Turdus philomelos) and European
   Robin (Erithacus rubecula) as potential indicator species for the four
   examined land abandonment levels. With these four species we
   successfully modelled the distribution of the recorded bird assemblages
   at the plot level along the four vegetation succession stages. We
   emphasized the need to develop new and integrative land use management
   concepts for areas affected by land abandonment in order to formulate
   sound conservation policy.}},

   The functioning of ecosystems can be strongly driven by landscape
   attributes. Despite its importance, however, our understanding of how
   landscape influences ecosystem function derives mostly from species
   richness and abundance patterns, with few studies assessing how these
   relate to actual functional rates.
   We examined the influence of landscape attributes on the rates of
   herbivory in seagrass meadows, where herbivory has been identified as a
   key process structuring these relatively simple systems. The study was
   conducted in three representative Posidonia oceanica meadows. The
   principal herbivores in these meadows are the fish Sarpa salpa and the
   sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus, and we hypothesized that differences
   in their interaction with landscape attributes would significantly
   influence herbivory rates.
   We measured herbivore abundance, herbivory rates, primary production and
   plant quality (C:N) in seagrass patches embedded either in rock or in
   sand (matrix attribute), in patches either near or far from a rocky reef
   (distance attribute) and at the edges and interior of meadows.
   Our results show that matrix and meadow edges significantly affected the
   actual levels of herbivory. Herbivory rates were higher in seagrass
   patches embedded in a rocky matrix compared to those on sand, and
   herbivory at the centre of seagrass meadows was higher than at the
   edges. In contrast, patch distance to rocky reefs did not affect
   herbivory. Neither herbivore abundance nor food quality explained the
   patterns across different landscape attributes. This suggests that
   variation in herbivory across the landscape may be related much more to
   behavioural differences between species in their evaluation of risk,
   movement and food preference in relation to the landscape structure.
   Our results indicate that richness and abundance patterns may mask
   critical interactions between landscape attributes and species
   responses, which result in considerable heterogeneity in the way key
   functional processes like herbivory are distributed across the ecosystem
   mosaic.

Abstract = {{Encroachment of woody plants is widespread in semiarid grasslands of the
   southwestern United States. Wildlife responses to shrub removal
   techniques in the region are relatively unknown. In 2008 and 2009, we
   examined avian responses to prescribed burning of ungrazed shortgrass
   prairie within a study area (4811 ha) near Amarillo, Texas, that is
   heavily encroached by honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa) and cholla
   (Opuntia spp.). Specifically, we compared relative abundance, species
   richness, and species diversity of breeding birds across large,
   spatially replicated experimental plots burned every 2 or 4 years since
   2002 and unburned controls. We found no significant differences in the
   mean relative abundance of most species across the treatments. However,
   Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), Cassin's Sparrow (Peucaea
   cassinii), and Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) were more abundant
   in less frequently burned plots and unburned controls. We found no
   differences in species richness or diversity across the treatments.
   Limited variation in avian responses across the treatments likely
   reflects the uniform pattern of vegetation structure we found across the
   plots, despite repeated application of prescribed fire at 2- and 4-year
   intervals over a 7-year period. Differences in bird species assemblages
   among the burn treatments might be more prominent in future years as
   prescribed burning continues.}},

Abstract = {{Western juniper has increased in density and distribution in the
   interior Pacific Northwest since the late 1800s. Management goals for
   many juniper woodlands are now focused on reducing tree densities and
   promoting biodiversity, prompting the use of fuel reduction treatments.
   Fuel reduction often involves mechanical cutting and disturbances such
   as slash pile burning and skid trail formation. While these activities
   may reduce tree densities, the extent to which they will restore native
   biodiversity and community composition, particularly in woodlands
   invaded by exotic annual grasses, is unclear. We evaluated the effects
   of juniper cutting in two experiments of disturbance type (slash piles
   and skid trails) followed by three native seeding treatments (cultivar,
   locally sourced, and no seed) on vegetation in central Oregon. Prior to
   cutting, native perennial grass cover and richness were positively
   associated and exotic grass cover was negatively associated with juniper
   basal area. After cutting and 2 yr after seeding, species composition
   was altered for both disturbance types. Some seeded areas had higher
   total species richness, higher native species richness, higher cover of
   seeded species, and higher overall cover compared to areas that were not
   seeded. But seeding effectiveness in mitigating exotic species spread
   varied based on exotic species functional group, pretreatment propagule
   pressure, and experiment disturbance type. Neither seed mix lowered
   exotic grass cover. There was limited evidence that the cultivar mix
   outperformed the locally sourced native seed mix. In the short term,
   fuel reduction activities may have facilitated further conversion of
   this woodland to an exotic grassland, but longer-term evaluation is
   needed. In juniper woodlands that have been invaded by exotic species,
   fuel reduction activities may facilitate further invasion, and exotic
   species control may be needed to limit invasion and promote native
   vegetation.}},

Journal = {{RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{693-700}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The interaction of resource availability and disturbance can strongly
   affect plant species richness and the spread of exotic plants. Several
   ecological theories posit that disturbance mediates the
   richness-reducing effects of increased competition as resource levels
   rise. In the low-nutrient serpentine grasslands of the San Francisco Bay
   Area, the fertilizing effects of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition may
   threaten native species by promoting nitrophilic exotic grasses.
   Attempts to mitigate these N deposition effects have focused on cattle
   grazing as a strategy to reduce exotic grass cover. We simulated
   realistic N deposition increases with low-level fertilization,
   manipulated grazing with fencing, and monitored grazing intensity using
   camera traps in a 4 yr factorial experiment to assess the effects of
   grazing and N deposition on several measures of native and exotic
   species dynamics in California's largest serpentine grassland. Our
   results suggest that native species diversity may increase slightly
   under low-level N deposition with moderate grazing in this system.
   However, grazing may not be effective at limiting exotic cover as N
   accumulates in the future. Examination of treatment trajectories using
   principal response curves indicated that responses to grazing might be
   determined more by functional group (forb or grass) than origin (native
   or exotic). Grazing intensity varied dramatically within the single
   stocking rate used to manage this ecosystem. Given this variation and
   the contrasting effects of grazing on different functional groups, more
   targeted management may be required to improve conservation outcomes.}},

Title = {{Direct and indirect drivers of plant diversity responses to climate and

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3093-3103}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that climate can influence plant community assembly via
   a multitude of indirect and direct pathways. However, interpretations of
   plant diversity responses to simulated climate change experiments, and
   subsequent predictions of plant communities under future climate
   scenarios, rarely address the importance of indirect effects. Networks
   of direct and indirect effects are also critical in understanding
   linkages between climate and grazing, a common land use of grasslands,
   and implications for plant diversity. We characterized the roles of
   indirect vs. direct effects in determining plant diversity responses to
   climate and grazing using data from three northern temperate grasslands
   in which we conducted factorial experiments manipulating precipitation,
   air temperature, and clipping intensity. Utilizing a structural equation
   modeling framework to address the multivariate networks, we found
   warming operated directly, causing species loss at all sites. We
   identified shoot biomass as the key indirect driver of diversity loss in
   response to both precipitation and clipping, regardless of site.
   However, site-specific contingencies in the network of interactions were
   important for understanding varied precipitation effects. At the driest
   site only, shoot biomass was resistant to reduced precipitation, and
   diversity was consequently unaltered. Similarly, disconnect between
   primary drivers and responses explained relatively idiosyncratic
   responses of evenness compared to richness. Importantly, the finding of
   widespread, directly controlled plant diversity loss with warming aligns
   with concerns about declining biodiversity under climate change.
   However, using a framework of network interactions also allowed us to
   pinpoint the source of variability in response across systems. Looking
   forward, we can use the identification of this key indirect pathway to
   guide an understanding of community assembly under factors likely to
   control shoot biomass. Viewing a multifactorial, multisite experimental
   approach through a framework of network interactions allowed us to both
   identify generalized responses and distill the complexity of contingent
   responses. This, along with the practical need to identify diversity
   responses to climate change and grazing, underscores the importance of
   understanding both indirect and direct drivers of ecosystem responses to
   global change factors.}},

Abstract = {{Plant species richness in central and northern European seminatural
   grasslands is often more closely linked to past than present habitat
   configuration, which is indicative of an extinction debt. In this study,
   we investigate whether signs of historical grassland management can be
   found in clear-cuts after at least 80years as coniferous production
   forest by comparing floras between clear-cuts with a history as meadow
   and as forest in the 1870s in Sweden. Study sites were selected using
   old land-use maps and data on present-day clear-cuts. Species traits
   reflecting high capacities for dispersal and persistence were used to
   explain any possible links between the plants and the historical land
   use. Clear-cuts that were formerly meadow had, on average, 36\% higher
   species richness and 35\% higher richness of grassland indicator
   species, as well as a larger overall seed mass and lower anemochory,
   compared to clear-cuts with history as forest. We suggest that the
   plants in former meadows never disappeared after afforestation but
   survived as remnant populations. Many contemporary forests in Sweden
   were managed as grasslands in the 1800s. As conservation of remaining
   grassland fragments will not be enough to reduce the existing extinction
   debts of the flora, these young forests offer opportunities for
   grassland restoration at large scales. Our study supports the concept of
   remnant populations and highlights the importance of considering
   historical land use for understanding the distribution of grassland
   plant species in fragmented landscapes, as well as for policy-making and
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{At the beginning of the 20th century, many montane heathlands were
   abandoned and became subject to natural succession or afforestation by
   humans. Thus, the formerly large montane heathlands slowly degraded into
   small and isolated patches. In this study, we evaluate the influence of
   restoration measures on leafhopper (Auchenorrhyncha) assemblages of
   montane heathland ecosystems in Central Europe. Our analyses comprised
   three different site types that were adjacent to each other: (1) montane
   heathlands, (2) restoration sites, and (3) control sites. Leafhoppers
   showed a clear response to montane heathland restoration. Thus, after
   4-5 years since implementation of restoration measurements restoration
   sites were characterized by the highest species richness. However,
   detailed analyses of leafhopper diversity, species composition, and
   environmental parameters on the three site types revealed that
   restoration sites were rather similar to control sites and significantly
   differing from montane heathlands. We conclude that leafhoppers are
   excellent bioindicators for restoration measurements because they
   reflected environmental differences between the three site types.
   Restoration measurements might only be a useful instrument to promote
   typical montane heathland leafhopper communities in the long run.
   Colonization by leafhoppers is, however, dependent on many different
   factors such as leafhopper mobility, vegetation structure, microclimate,
   and the establishment of ericaceous dwarf shrubs. Practitioners should
   establish a management regime (grazing and sod-cutting) that creates a
   mosaic of different habitat structures and increases typical heathland
   vegetation, thus, favoring the colonization of typical heathland
   leafhoppers.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how insular ecosystems recover or are restructured after
   the eradication of an invasive species is crucial in evaluating
   conservation success and prioritizing island conservation efforts.
   Globally, herbivores have been removed from 762 islands, most with
   limited active restoration actions following eradication. Few studies
   have documented the effects of invasive herbivore removal after multiple
   decades of passive recovery. Here we evaluate recovery of vegetation on
   Santa Cruz Island, California, after the removal of feral sheep (Ovis
   aries) in 1984. We repeat a study conducted in 1980, and examine
   vegetation changes 28 years after the eradication. Before eradication,
   grazed areas were characterized by reduced plant cover, high exposure of
   bare ground, and erosion. After 28 years of passive recovery, transect
   data showed a 23\% increase in woody overstory, whereas analysis of
   photographs from landscapes photographed pre- and post-eradication
   showed a 26\% increase in woody vegetation. Whole island vegetation maps
   similarly showed a transition from grass/bare ground (74.3\% of cover)
   to woody plants (77.2\% of cover), indicating the transition away from
   predominantly exotic annual grassland toward a community similar to the
   overstory of coastal scrubland but with an understory dominated by
   non-native annual grasses. We estimate that replacement of grasses/bare
   ground by native woody vegetation has led to 70 and 17\% increases in
   the stored carbon and nitrogen pools on the island, respectively. Our

Abstract = {{Understanding how vegetation composition varies with season and
   interannual climate variability is important for any ecological research
   that uses vegetation data derived from surveys for the basis of
   inference. Misunderstanding this variation can influence land management
   and planning decisions, leading to poor implementation of biodiversity
   offsetting mechanisms, for example. We monitored plots (400m(2)) grazed
   by livestock paired with adjacent ungrazed plots in derived native
   pastures four times a year over 2.5 years on the North-West Slopes of
   New South Wales. Species density in plots varied greatly with season and
   interannual rainfall. Highest species density was recorded in spring,
   though species density in summer was not significantly lower, nor was a
   spring-summer peak in species density evident in the 2009 drought.
   Surveys in spring 2008 had the highest species density, and recorded
   only 60-72\% of the total species recorded at each site over 2.5 years.
   Variation in the proportion of total site diversity represented in
   combinations of two or three surveys was large, though the best
   combinations comprised surveys from spring and summer in years of
   above-average rainfall, either from the same spring-summer, or from
   different years. Compositional differences among sites were much greater
   than within sites, showing that differences among sites related to broad
   environmental gradients were not overwhelmed by seasonal and interannual
   variability in site composition. When grazing was excluded, there was no
   evidence of competitive exclusion by the dominant grasses, and no
   directional shift in composition. The implications of these findings for
   ecological research depend on the question being addressed: if capturing
   a large proportion of site diversity is important, then surveys must be
   carefully timed, or repeat surveys must be conducted. Single surveys did
   not effectively capture site diversity for use in biodiversity
   offsetting, and the timing of repeat surveys was critical.}},

Abstract = {{Plant diversity is threatened in many agricultural landscapes. Our
   understanding of patterns of plant diversity in these landscapes is
   mainly based on small-scale (<1000m(2)) observations of species
   richness. However, such observations are insufficient for detecting the
   spatial heterogeneity of vegetation composition. In a case-study farm on
   the North-West Slopes of New South Wales, Australia, we observed species
   richness at four scales (quadrat, patch, land use and landscape) across
   five land uses (grazed and ungrazed woodlands, native pastures,
   roadsides and crops). We applied two landscape ecological models to
   assess the contribution of these land uses to landscape species
   richness: (i) additive partitioning of diversity at multiple spatial
   scales, and (ii) a measure of habitat specificity - the effective number
   of species that a patch contributes to landscape species richness.
   Native pastures had less variation between patches than grazed and
   ungrazed woodlands, and hence were less species-rich at the landscape
   scale, despite having similar richness to woodlands at the quadrat and
   patch scale. Habitat specificity was significantly higher for ungrazed
   woodland patches than all other land uses. Our results showed that in
   this landscape, ungrazed woodland patches had a higher contribution than
   the grazed land uses to landscape species richness. These results have
   implications for the conservation management of this landscape, and
   highlighted the need for greater consensus on the influence of different
   land uses on landscape patterns of plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Mowing of semi-natural grasslands is an important management method to
   maintain the conservation value and species-richness of this habitat.
   Mowing using cutting instruments, e.g. sickle bar mowers, is thought to
   be superior by practitioners compared with other mechanical instruments
   that tears off the plant material, e.g. grass trimmers. However, almost
   no studies exist that supports this assumption. We analysed a 12-year
   field trial in a semi-natural grassland in south-eastern Sweden, with
   the aim of determining which mowing technique best maintains the
   conservation value of semi-natural grasslands. Two mowing techniques
   were compared: mowing using a hand-pushed sickle bar mower (a type of
   knife mower), or mowing using a grass trimmer at a 5-cm or 0-cm cutting
   height. The odds that a recorded species belongs to a group of indicator
   species were calculated for sample plots, and odds ratios were
   calculated contrasting treatments. Three types of indicator species
   classification systems were used: (i) indicators of management for
   species richness, (ii) indicators of excess nitrogen and (iii)
   indicators of lack of management. The odds ratios were calculated for
   years 1-5, 7 and 12 of the trial. In addition, Principal Response Curve
   analysis was performed to analyse the change in vegetation composition
   over time and ANOVA for plant species richness in plots. The results
   showed that over time there were no differences in the odds of finding
   indicators of any of the three types, for any of the mowing techniques.
   Furthermore, there were no apparent change in vegetation composition and
   only a small effect on richness. These results suggest that mowing using
   a sickle bar mower or a grass trimmer had the same effect on the
   floristic composition of grasslands, and both techniques can be
   recommended for use in semi-natural grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Forest pastures, like many other semi-natural (traditional) rural
   biotopes, have undergone a drastic decline both in area and quality
   during the last century in many areas. We explored the bryophyte flora
   of Finnish coniferous forest pastures on acidic soil and aimed to
   recognize the most important microsites (rocks, coarse woody debris,
   tree bases, mineral soil patches and closed vegetation) for bryophyte
   diversity. The effects of microhabitat heterogeneity (microsite entropy)
   on bryophytes was also examined. We found altogether 83 bryophyte
   species. The only red-listed species, Tayloria tenuis, was frequently
   found on dung patches and a few rare ruderal species grew exclusively on
   bare mineral soil. Rocks comprised the most species rich microsite and
   many common forest floor species showed preference for this microsite.
   Microhabitat heterogeneity explained bryophyte species richness on both
   alpha (plot average) and gamma (pasture total) scales. The results
   suggest that certain individual bryophyte species and their microsites
   should be taken into account in the management of this biotope, rather
   than guiding the management solely on the basis of the overall bryophyte
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{AimRates of tree population expansion have increased in many North
   American landscapes that were mosaics of grasslands, savannas and
   woodlands historically. Consequences of woodland expansion include
   reduced economic return from grazing and changes in native biodiversity,
   but causes of woodland expansion are poorly understood. We address
   historical timing of blackjack oak (Quercus marilandica) and post oak
   (Quercus stellata) population expansion in tree-grass ecosystems, roles
   of climate and land use in driving this expansion, and future stability
   of these woodlands.
   LocationThe Cross Timbers ecosystem in Kansas, USA.
   MethodsUsing increment cores, we quantified blackjack oak and post oak
   age structures in four woodlands on sites that were not wooded in the
   1860s. We compared timing of oak regeneration with climate fluctuations
   (using the Palmer drought severity index) and land-use history. We
   quantified tree species composition within 5-m radii of sampled oaks.
   ResultsRecruitment of both oak species increased between 1925 and 1945.
   Modal age classes recruited from 1935 to 1960. Recruitment was
   associated with dry intervals at the two sites with north- or
   east-facing aspects. This association was driven by blackjack oak
   recruitment in dry intervals. Woodlands on the sites with south- and
   west-facing aspects contained only oaks, whereas those on the sites with
   north- and east-facing aspects contained saplings of fire-intolerant,
   shade-tolerant tree species.
   Main conclusionsOur results contribute to growing evidence for woodland
   expansion in the region during dry climate intervals. The association
   between drought and recruitment was influenced by slope aspect and was
   more pronounced in the less fire-tolerant oak species. Although woodland
   expansion coincided with regional increases in fire frequency, drought
   and greater use of prescribed burning are likely to have reduced fire
   intensities by reducing fuel loads. These oak woodlands, which have
   developed during the 20th century, appear to form stable communities on
   xeric slopes but to be undergoing succession towards a mesophytic tree
   community on mesic slopes.}},

Abstract = {{Managed grasslands are normally ecosystems with high species diversity.
   They are associated with traditional extensive livestock grazing.
   Land-use changes, in particular gradual abandonment or grazing
   intensification, lead to major changes in floristic patterns of these
   grasslands, some included in priority habitats of the EU Habitats
   Directive. In order to analyse these patterns of change, Mediterranean
   grasslands of eastern areas of mainland Portugal were studied aiming to:
   (1) establish ecological gradients underlying their floristic patterns;
   (2) examine the relative importance of both environmental and land-use
   factors on their floristic composition; (3) assess how floristic
   composition and species richness are affected by land-use factors.
   Vegetation sampling was carried out from 2008 to 2009 following
   phytosociological procedures. Canonical Correspondence Analysis was
   applied. Variation partitioning was used to assess the relative
   influence of land-use variables. Richness, legumes cover, endemic
   species and bryophytes cover were compared in four land-management
   regimes: unmanaged; extensive grazing by sheep; extensive grazing by
   cattle and sheep; frequent soil tillage. Significant differences were
   found in floristic and diversity patterns, revealing the importance of
   grazing as a management tool for maintaining or improving floristic
   diversity. From our findings slight extensive grazing can contribute to
   both maintenance of species diversity and to the increase in legumes
   cover and thus to palatability and economic value of studied grasslands.
   Interactions between herbivores and grasslands, considering also their
   influences on soil properties, have an important role in the equilibrium
   states which promote biodiversity and conservation of the services of
   these ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in plants and herbivorous insects due to land use abandonment
   and intensification have been studied in agricultural areas worldwide.
   We tested four hypotheses, which were complementary rather than mutually
   exclusive, to understand the mechanisms driving biodiversity declines
   due to abandonment and intensification. These predict that biodiversity
   decline is caused by a decline in resource diversity, changes in
   disturbance regime, surrounding landscape conversion, and a decrease in
   biomass production. We compared plant richness and butterfly and
   orthopteran richness and diversity among three land use types in
   seminatural grasslands: abandoned, traditional, and intensified
   terraces. Then, we examined effects of changes in resource (plant)
   richness, frequency of disturbance (mowing), and surrounding landscapes
   on butterfly and orthopteran diversity to understand the mechanisms
   driving decline after land abandonment and intensification. Plant and
   herbivore richness and diversity were significantly lower in abandoned
   and intensified grasslands than in traditional grasslands. This trend
   was consistent throughout the seasons in both years of the study.
   Changes in mowing frequency and surrounding landscape explained plant
   richness declines as a consequence of land abandonment and
   intensification. Declines in herbivorous insects were explained by plant
   richness declines and changes in mowing frequency, but not by landscape
   changes. Plant and herbivore richness were maximized at an intermediate
   mowing frequency (approximately twice per year), which is typical
   practice on traditional terraces. This is the first report demonstrating
   that the intermediate disturbance hypothesis explained well the
   biodiversity declines in agricultural ecosystems. The richness and
   diversity responses of herbivore functional groups to plant richness,
   mowing frequency, and surrounding landscapes were generally inconsistent
   with predictions. We found significant trends in which butterfly and
   orthopteran species with low abundance in traditional terraces were lost
   in abandoned and/or intensive terraces. This may suggest that the number
   of individuals of most herbivorous species decreased randomly with
   respect to life-history traits following a decline in plant richness
   after changes in disturbance frequency. This study demonstrates that
   declines in herbivorous insects can be explained by multiple factors,
   and provides a unified explanation for biodiversity declines in both
   abandoned and intensified use of agricultural lands, which have often
   been studied separately.}},

Abstract = {{Vast areas of rangelands across the world are grazed with increasing
   intensity, but interactions between livestock production, biodiversity
   and other ecosystem services are poorly studied. This study explicitly
   determines trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services and
   livestock grazing intensity on rangelands. Grazing intensity and its
   effects on forage utilization by livestock, carbon sequestration,
   erosion prevention and biodiversity are quantified and mapped, using
   global datasets and models. Results show that on average 4\% of the
   biomass produced annually is consumed by livestock. On average, erosion
   prevention is 10\% lower in areas with a high grazing intensity compared
   to areas with a low grazing intensity, whereas carbon emissions are more
   than four times higher under high grazing intensity compared to low
   grazing intensity. Rangelands with the highest grazing intensity are
   located in the Sahel, Pakistan, West India, Middle East, North Africa
   and parts of Brazil. These high grazing intensities result in carbon
   emissions, low biodiversity values, low capacity for erosion prevention
   and unsustainable forage utilization. Although the applied models
   simplify the processes of ecosystem service supply, our study provides a
   global overview of the consequences of grazing for biodiversity and
   ecosystem services. The expected increasing future demand for livestock
   products likely increase pressures on rangelands. Global-scale models
   can help to identify targets and target areas for international policies
   aiming at sustainable future use of these rangelands. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The vegetation of semi-arid and arid landscapes is often comprised of
   mixtures of herbaceous and woody vegetation. Since the early 1900s,
   shifts from herbaceous to woody plant dominance, termed woody plant
   encroachment and widely regarded as a state change, have occurred
   world-wide. This shift presents challenges to the conservation of
   grassland and savanna ecosystems and to animal production in commercial
   ranching systems and pastoral societies. Dryland management focused on
   cattle and sheep grazing has historically attempted to reduce the
   abundance of encroaching woody vegetation (hereafter, brush management')
   with the intent of reversing declines in forage production, stream flow
   or groundwater recharge. Here, we assess the known and potential
   consequences of brush management actions, both positive and negative, on
   a broader suite of ecosystem services, the scientific challenges to
   quantifying these services and the trade-offs among them. Our synthesis
   suggests that despite considerable investments accompanying the
   application of brush management practices, the recovery of key ecosystem
   services may be short-lived or absent. However, in the absence of such
   interventions, those and other ecosystem services may be compromised,
   and the persistence of grassland and savanna ecosystem types and their
   endemic plants and animals threatened. Addressing the challenges posed
   by woody plant encroachment will require integrated management systems
   using diverse theoretical principles to design the type, timing and
   spatial arrangement of initial management actions and follow-up
   treatments. These management activities will need to balance cultural
   traditions and preferences, socio-economic constraints and potentially
   competing land-use objectives.Synthesis. Our ability to predict
   ecosystem responses to management aimed at recovering ecosystem services
   where grasslands and savannas have been invaded by native or exotic
   woody plants is limited for many attributes (e.g. primary production,
   land surface-atmosphere interactions, biodiversity conservation) and
   inconsistent for others (e.g. forage production, herbaceous diversity,
   water quality/quantity, soil erosion, carbon sequestration). The
   ecological community is challenged with generating robust information
   about the response of ecosystem services and their interactions if we
   are to position land managers and policymakers to make objective,
   science-based decisions regarding the many trade-offs and competing
   objectives for the conservation and dynamic management of grasslands and
   savannas.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{102}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Nutrient additions typically increase terrestrial ecosystem
   productivity, reduce plant diversity and alter plant community
   composition; however, the effects of P additions and interactions
   between N and P are understudied. We added both N (10gm(-2)) and three
   levels of P (2.5, 5 and 10gm(-2)) to a native, ungrazed tallgrass
   prairie burned biennially in northeastern Kansas, USA, to determine the
   independent and interactive effects of N and P on plant community
   composition and above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP). After a
   decade of nutrient additions, we found few effects of P alone on plant
   community composition, N alone had stronger effects, and N and P
   additions combined resulted in much larger effects than either alone.
   The changes in the plant community were driven by decreased abundance of
   C-4 grasses, perhaps in response to altered interactions with
   mycorrhizal fungi, concurrent with increased abundance of non-N-fixing
   perennial and annual forbs. Surprisingly, this large shift in plant
   community composition had little effect on plant community richness,
   evenness and diversity. The shift in plant composition with N and P
   combined had large but variable effects on ANPP over time. Initially, N
   and N and P combined increased above-ground productivity of C-4 grasses,
   but after 4years, productivity returned to ambient levels as grasses
   declined in abundance and the community shifted to dominance by
   non-N-fixing and annual forbs. Once these forbs increased in abundance
   and became dominant, ANPP was more variable, with pulses in forb
   production only in years when the site was burned.Synthesis. We found
   that a decade of N and P additions interacted to drive changes in plant
   community composition, which had large effects on ecosystem productivity
   but minimal effects on plant community diversity. The large shift in
   species composition increased variability in ANPP over time as a
   consequence of the effects of burning. Thus, increased inputs of N and P
   to terrestrial ecosystems have the potential to alter stability of
   ecosystem function over time, particularly within the context of natural
   disturbance regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock production has been challenged as a large contributor to
   climate change, and carbon footprint has become a widely used measure of
   cattle environmental impact. This analysis of fifteen beef grazing
   systems in Uruguay quantifies the range of variation of carbon

   variables, using a partial life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology.
   Using carbon footprint as the primary environmental indicator has
   several limitations: different metrics (GWP vs. GTP) may lead to
   different conclusions, carbon sequestration from soils may drastically
   affect the results, and systems with lower carbon footprint may have
   higher energy use, soil erosion, nutrient imbalance, pesticide
   ecotoxicity, and impact on biodiversity. A multidimensional assessment
   of sustainability of meat production is therefore needed to inform

   Plateau. Our results indicated that aboveground biomass (AGB)
   significantly differed among grassland types and declined northwesterly
   from 64.07 to 11.44 g m(-2) with decreasing precipitation and increasing
   temperature. The mean ABD exhibited considerable community dependency,
   with meadow (12.47 g m(-2)) > steppe (6.91 g m(-2)) > desert steppe
   (2.54 g m(-2)), and it declined from 25.42 to 1.29 g m(-2) with
   decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature. `Good forage', i.e.
   grasses and sedges, benefited most from grazing exclusion, followed by
   edible forbs. With longer grazing exclusion durations (GEDs), the
   aboveground biomass of poisonous locoweeds initially decreased and then
   increased compared with the adjacent grazed sites. In the nested
   analysis of co-variances with a general linear model, growing season
   precipitation (GSP; from May to September) accounted for 52.67\% of the
   observed variation in AGB, followed by AGT (9.77 \%) and pasture
   management systems (PMSs; grazing or grazing-excluded, 5.31 \%). The
   variation in ABD was explained primarily by AGT (16.52 \%), GED (20.25
   \%), and the interaction of AGT x GED (19.58 \%). Our results confirm
   that precipitation is the primary factor controlling the ANPP of alpine
   grasslands on the Northern Tibetan Plateau and that the ecological
   benefits arising from grazing exclusion are also partly dependent on
   grassland type and exclusion duration. Therefore, spatial and temporal
   variations in growing season precipitation and plant functional traits
   or economic group composition should be jointly considered when
   developing policies concerning the management and spatial layouts of
   grazing exclosures in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional rural biotopes (TRBs) are semi-natural farmland habitats of
   high nature value formed through traditional agricultural activities,
   such as grazing and fodder collection. The aims of this study were to 1)
   understand manager motivations for managing TRBs and their attitudes
   toward TRB conservation and 2) determine whether TRB managers differ in
   attitude, motivation for management, experiences or area under
   management depending on whether their managed TRBs are integrated or
   separate from their farming systems. Farmers and landowners (N=27)
   managing TRBs in coastal Finland were interviewed. In addition to
   quantitative analysis, responses were mapped with DebateGraph for
   inductive analysis to discern patterns amongst the two groups and to
   explore a series of questions related to motivations. Although area
   under management and farming strategy varied amongst managers, they all
   had a positive view toward the existential value of TRBs. A small group
   of ``TRB entrepreneurs{''}, whose farming strategy was based on grazing
   primarily rented TRBs was identified. Their farming income was dependent
   upon direct sale of meat and participation in agri-environmental scheme
   for TRB management. Desire for open landscape was the primary motivation
   for managing TRBs and strongly outweighed extrinsic values such as
   fodder production and AES. Higher TRB: farm ratio was associated with
   more positive attitude toward TRBs and TRB conservation. No difference
   was found in motivation for management between the two farmer groups.
   Although motivations were similar, improved and tailored extension
   services for TRB managers could promote their conservation management.

Abstract = {{We studied the vegetation development in the Pannonian salt steppes in
   SW Slovakia (class Festuco-Puccinellietea) for eight years on permanent
   plots. The saline grassland was ploughed in 2002 to cultivate wheat and
   barley, and after two years it was left fallow. An open vegetation
   structure was typical for the initial stages, dominated by the obligate
   halophyte Tripolium pannonicum, accompanied by Atriplex littoralis and
   other annuals. Species richness significantly increased in the
   subsequent years. From the fifth year of the study, a significant
   increase of facultative halophytes (e.g. Lotus tenuis, Tetragonolobus
   maritimus, Agrostis stolonifera) and colonization of some expansive
   species (Phragmites communis, Calamagrostis epigejos) was observed and
   accompanied by a decrease in the cover of obligate halophytes (T.
   pannonicum and Puccinellia distans). Plantago maritima exhibited an
   opposite trend, and it was the only halophyte that was able to increase
   its population after the disturbance, due to vegetative propagation by
   rhizomes which increased the competitiveness of the species. The
   declining presence of salt-demanding species indicates a strong
   degradation of the saline vegetation, which might be linked to gradual
   desalinization of the soil. We conclude that population fluxes after
   adverse human disturbance and subsequent abandonment are very high, and
   succession of halophytic communities after such a strong disturbance is
   very fast, leading to deterioration of the habitat.}},

Abstract = {{For adequate conservation planning, ecologists need to understand the
   driving factors of the species richness and composition patterns of
   arthropod assemblages. The present study scrutinizes how the vegetation,
   the surrounding matrix and the process of fragmentation affects the
   diversity and the composition of arthropod assemblages in dune slack
   meadow remnants of an agricultural landscape in southern Hungary.
   Spiders, orthopterans and true bugs were sampled with sweep netting in a
   total of 25 sand steppe, mesotrophic wet meadow and alkaline meadow
   patches. Our general findings showed that the structure and species
   composition of arthropod assemblages depended primarily on the
   vegetation type. From among the size and shape of the patches, their
   extent of isolation and the types of the surrounding landscapes only the
   latter one could be shown to have a significant effect, though this was
   also restricted to the group of spiders. Therefore, the structure and
   composition of spider assemblages may be used as indicators for the
   adjacent agricultural activities. Unlike its effect on species
   composition, the effect of vegetation type was not consistent on the
   species richness of the arthropod assemblages and functional groups. The
   influence of vegetation type was greater on the species richness of
   herbivores (specialist and generalist true bugs and grasshoppers) than
   on that of the carnivores (spiders, bush crickets and carnivorous true
   bugs). Based on the fact that neither patch size nor the extent of
   isolation, i.e. the measures of fragmentation, influenced the species
   richness of the majority of the arthropod groups significantly, we
   conclude that fragmentation was not the main threat for the studied
   arthropod fauna. Furthermore, the present study calls attention to the
   limited efficiency of Island Biogeography Theory in the case of
   relatively large, traditionally managed grasslands embedded in extensive
   agricultural landscapes, like the general landscape pattern of the Great
   Hungarian Plain. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As part of a major transformation of the EU agriculture in the last few
   decades, traditional land-use types disappeared due to either
   intensification or abandonment. Grasslands are highly affected in this
   process and are consequently among the most threatened semi-natural
   habitats in Europe. However, experimental evidence is scarce on the
   effects of management types on biodiversity. Moreover, management types
   need to be feasible within the recently changed socio-economic
   circumstances in Hungary. We investigated the effects of timing and
   frequency of mowing on the abundance of the scarce large blue butterfly
   (Phengaris teleius), on the abundance of its host plant and on the
   frequency of its host ant species. In each of four study meadows, we
   applied four types of management: one cut per year in May, one cut per
   year in September, two cuts per year (May and September) and cessation
   of management. After three years of experimental management, we found
   that adult butterflies preferred plots cut once in September over plots
   cut twice per year and abandoned ones, while plots cut once in May were
   also preferred over abandoned plots. Relative host plant abundance
   remarkably increased in plots cut once in September. Management did not
   affect the occupancy pattern of Myrmica host ants. Invasive goldenrod
   was successfully retained by two cuts per year. To our knowledge, this
   is the first attempt to test management effects on the whole community
   module of a socially parasitic butterfly, its host plant and host ants.
   Based on the results, we provide recommendations on regional management
   of the scarce large blue's habitats. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Understanding what determines species co-occurrence and its consequences
   for ecosystem functioning is central to the study of plant ecology. The
   ecological similarity of species can explain co-occurrence patterns,
   species interactions, and how species affect ecosystem processes. A
   useful approach to answer these questions is to group similar species in
   functional groups and then perform removal experiments. Here, we
   conducted a scientometric review of articles about plant functional
   diversity and plant functional group removal. We identified publication
   patterns and impact; environmental and geographic gaps; ecological
   effects being tested; which groups are removed; and what the removal
   methods are. We analyzed articles published between 1991 and 2012 in
   journals indexed for the Thomson ISI Web of Science database. Although
   the number of articles and citations of experimental articles increased
   during that period, the corresponding increase for functional diversity
   articles was 12 times greater. This might be because field and cafeteria
   experiments are harder to conduct. Most studies were performed in
   temperate regions, where taxonomic knowledge and scientific investment
   is greater. Studies on herbaceous vegetation predominate, probably
   because short-lived species are more easily removed and manipulated than
   are trees. The main reason for the removal experiments was to test
   hypotheses related to competition, and clipping at ground level was the
   most common removal method. Few studies were performed in the field and
   in greenhouses, which could control for differential responses of
   natural conditions and controlled environments.}},

Abstract = {{Species turnover across elevational gradients has matured into an
   important paradigm of community ecology. Here, we tested whether
   ecological and phylogenetic structure of skipper butterfly assemblages
   is more strongly structured according to altitude or vegetation type
   along three elevation gradients of moderate extent in Serra do Mar,
   Southern Brazil. Skippers were surveyed along three different mountain
   transects, and data on altitude and vegetation type of every collection
   site were recorded. NMDS ordination plots were used to assess community
   turnover and the influence of phylogenetic distance between species on
   apparent community patterns. Ordinations based on ecological similarity
   (Bray-Curtis index) were compared to those based on phylogenetic
   distance measures (MPD and MNTD) derived from a supertree. In the
   absence of a well-resolved phylogeny, various branch length
   transformation methods were applied together with four different null
   models, aiming to assess if results were confounded by low-resolution
   trees. Species composition as well as phylogenetic community structure
   of skipper butterflies were more prominently related to vegetation type
   instead of altitude per se. Phylogenetic distances reflected spatial
   community patterns less clearly than species composition, but revealed a
   more distinct fauna of monocot feeders associated with grassland
   habitats, implying that historical factors have played a fundamental
   role in shaping species composition across elevation gradients.
   Phylogenetic structure of community turned out to be a relevant

Abstract = {{Among the techniques used for the restoration of terrestrial ecosystems,
   soil transfer has already produced encouraging results for
   re-establishing species-rich grassland plant communities. On August 7
   2009, a serious oil pipeline leak occurred in the La Crau steppe in
   south-eastern France. In 2010, more than 5 ha of steppe vegetation were
   then destroyed by the excavation, and removal of polluted soil.
   Restoration of the site was achieved by transferring 72 000 t of
   identical soil from a nearby quarry. Soil was applied in four
   treatments, each with a different degree of profile complexity. After
   three years (2011, 2012 and 2013), our results show that the replacement
   of the soil to include horizon similar to the reference steppe allows
   recovery of the vegetation in terms of composition, similarity and
   species richness of the steppe vegetation during this period. The
   ecological engineering guidelines aimed at limiting the transit time of
   the soil and the reconstitution of its vertical layer organisation
   resulted in the improved recovery of the vegetation without colonisation
   by non-target species. This system may further benefit from
   reintroduction of traditional sheep grazing to promote sustainability
   following the restoration of the steppe vegetation. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands are a crucial habitat for many butterfly species
   and the structure and extent of that grassland often dictates the
   composition of butterfly communities on the landscape. To understand
   effects on butterfly communities, we studied the impacts of different
   management schemes used to maintain semi-natural grasslands, including
   mowing every 3 y, mowing annually, and continuous summertime grazing.
   Transect count data were gathered over the 3 summers (2007-2009) in the
   Southern Appalachian Mountains of western Virginia and North Carolina.
   Eleven thousand two hundred and four butterfly individuals of 42
   different species were documented over the course of the study. Fields
   with minimal management, being mowed only once every 3 y, had the
   largest benefit to butterfly communities. Species richness, abundance,
   and Shannon diversity was significantly higher in these fields. While
   abundance was not significantly different between annually mowed fields
   and grazed fields, mowed fields were significantly higher in richness
   and diversity. The analysis of habitat specialist species revealed
   minimally managed and mowed fields were higher in abundance and richness
   than grazed fields. The response of individual butterfly species also
   showed negative effects of grazing on habitat specialists. Overall, the
   results suggest a varying response by different groups of species as
   well as individual species, indicating multiple management techniques
   are necessary for conserving a wide range of species. Specific
   techniques can be used in conservation to target specialist groups of
   butterflies and rare species.}},

Abstract = {{How grazing-induced ecosystem changes by ungulates indirectly affect
   other consumers is a question of great interest. I investigated the
   effect of grazing by American Bison (Bos bison L.) on an arthropod
   community in tallgrass prairie. Grazing increased the abundance of
   arthropods, an increase that was present in both herbivorous and
   carnivorous assemblages, but not in detritivores. The increase in
   herbivores and reduction in plant biomass from grazing resulted in an
   arthropod herbivore load almost three times higher in grazed plots
   compared with controls. Among herbivores, the sap-feeding insect guild
   was dramatically more abundant, while chewing herbivores were not
   affected. Herbivorous and carnivorous arthropod richness was higher in
   grazed plots, although the response was strongest among herbivores.
   Arthropod abundance on individual grasses and forbs was significantly
   higher in grazed areas, while plant type had no effect on abundance,
   indicating that the change was ecosystem-wide and not simply in response
   to a reduction in grass biomass from grazing. The response of arthropods
   to grazing was strongest in the early part of the growing season.
   Published research shows that ungulate grazing, although decreasing
   available biomass to other consumers, enhances plant quality by
   increasing nitrogen level in plants. The arthropod results of this study
   suggest higher plant quality outweighs the potential negative
   competitive effects of plant biomass removal, although other activities
   of bison could not be ruled out as the causative mechanism. Because
   arthropods are extremely abundant organisms in grasslands and a food
   source for other consumers, bison may represent valuable management
   tools for maintaining biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionFor over three decades, low-intensity grazing has been used to
   maintain or increase plant species richness in European natural areas,
   but the effects are highly variable. Thus far, good predictors of
   whether grazing will have positive effects on plant species richness are
   limited. How does the interplay between low-intensity grazing and
   topographic heterogeneity affect plant species richness at different
   spatial scales?
   LocationLong-term grazed and ungrazed salt marshes of the Dutch Wadden
   Sea island of Schiermonnikoog.
   MethodsWe selected ten plots of 2200m(2) in grazed and ungrazed areas of
   our study sites, and recorded and compared plant species richness in
   0.1, 1, 10, 100 and 1000m(2) subplots. Topographic heterogeneity was
   quantified at the plot scale using the standard deviation of the
   elevation derived from a high-resolution (5mx5m) digital elevation
   model. We calculated species-area relationships to analyse our data.
   ResultsWe found that large-scale topographic heterogeneity (based on the
   whole plot of 2200m(2)) positively affects plant species richness at all
   scales (even at the smallest 0.1-m(2) scale), and that grazing has a
   positive additive effect at the small scales (0.1 and 10m(2)). While
   grazing also had a positive effect on species richness at larger scales
   (1000m(2)), the strength of the effect was dependent on the topographic
   heterogeneity at that scale. The effectiveness of grazing for increased
   plant species richness was highest at low topographic heterogeneity, and
   lowest at intermediate topographic heterogeneity. Effects of
   intermediate heterogeneity were probably counterbalanced by the effects
   of grazing.
   ConclusionsOur results suggest that the variation in elevation is an
   important predictor of whether low-intensity grazing has positive
   effects on plant species richness or not. Grazing appears most
   beneficial at low topographic heterogeneity, but whether these findings
   hold for other grazed ecosystems will depend on several factors, most
   importantly, the relationship between topographic and abiotic
   heterogeneity. Results of our study are highly relevant for the
   application of low-intensity grazing as tool for conservation management
   in salt marshes and other natural areas.}},

Title = {{Effects of grazing vs mowing on the functional diversity of

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{658-669}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{QuestionsIn order to preserve the ecosystem functioning of semi-natural
   sub-Mediterranean calcareous grasslands of the Central Apennines, it is
   vital to understand how functional diversity (FD) changes in relation to
   different types of disturbance. To compare the effects of sheep grazing
   and those of late-summer mowing, we asked: do different types of
   disturbance (grazing and mowing) affect FD; are FD and species diversity
   positively correlated in both grazed and mown grasslands; do FD and
   species diversity take different paths in the two disturbance regimes;
   and are different FD values related to changes in the composition of
   traits linked to competitive ability, resource acquisition and
   resistance strategies?
   LocationGrazed and mown sites in the Central Apennines (Italy).
   MethodsWe performed redundancy analysis and indicator species analysis
   to characterize the trait composition of the two disturbance regimes. We
   calculated FD for each selected trait and a compound FD for multiple
   traits, using Rao's quadratic entropy index. Differences in FD between
   disturbance regimes were tested with a nested ANOVA. We performed a
   regression analysis between FD and species diversity indices under the
   two disturbance types.
   ResultsSpecies and functional diversity were positively correlated in
   both disturbance types. FD was generally less correlated with species
   diversity variations in mown grasslands than in grazed ones, suggesting
   that late mowing leads to higher levels of functional redundancy (i.e.
   to a wider overlap of species functional composition). Late mowing
   promoted higher species and functional diversities and a wider variety
   of functional traits in the plant community. Grazing, besides negatively
   affecting the species diversity of grasslands, reduced their FD by
   favouring the dominance of traits related to avoidance and tolerance
   strategies.
   ConclusionThe continuation of late mowing is recommended to preserve the
   richness and variability of functional groups and the ecosystem
   functioning of sub-Mediterranean grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Limited information is available about the impact of grazing on soil and
   plant nutrient contents in Mediterranean deciduous oak forests grazed by
   both livestock and wild life. Thus, the main objective of this study was
   to investigate the effect of wild boar and small ruminants grazing in a
   coppice oak forest in N Greece. Eight even-aged stands of similar canopy
   cover and site quality were selected: four stands with long-time grazing
   mainly by wild boar and four stands with longtime grazing by sheep and
   goats. A plot of 150 m(2) in each of the stands was fenced in order to
   be protected from grazing. A similarly sized plot open to grazing was
   assigned next to the fenced plot. Species composition was recorded in
   fenced and grazed plots. Soil samples and individual plants of the
   dominant palatable grass species Dactylis glomerata and Brachypodium
   sylvaticum were collected in every fenced and grazed plot. These samples
   were analysed for contents of nutrients. The results indicated that
   grazing increased organic matter, C, and total N, P and Ca, while it had
   no effect on the plant nutrients Mg, Na, K and all micronutrients, and
   pH as well. Wild boar grazing had a significantly negative impact on the
   concentrations of Na, Fe, Zn, and Mn in the soil. Beside a decrease in K
   and Mn, grazing had minimal effects on the contents of plant nutrients.
   Conversely, wild boar grazing increased the contents of several
   nutrients such as N, Na, Cu and Fe in plant tissue. It seems that
   species composition was more affected by the topography and management
   than by the soil features as revealed by RDA analysis. The results of
   this study indicate that it is important to maintain moderate small
   ruminant grazing intensity for the sustainable multi-disciplinary
   management of coppice oak forests. It is also important to control wild
   boar population in order to facilitate ecosystem process, soil
   preservation and forage quality.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal grazing pressure on rocky pastures is beneficial to the
   development of plant species and maintenance of plant diversity. Both
   abandonment of grazing and over-grazing gradually reduce plant
   diversity. This paper correlated abundance patterns of the flora on
   rocky pastures with the values of the chemical composition of the soil
   resulting from the degree of sheep grazing intensity. The study was
   carried out in the period from 2008 to 2010 on the islands of Pag, Krk
   and Cres. At 30 sites, 310 taxa of vascular plants were found. The
   highest plant diversity and 220 plant taxa were found on moderately
   grazed pastures. Abandoned pastures with a total of 93 plant taxa
   observed show the dominance of phanerophytes (35.5\%) and the highest
   proportion of the Mediterranean floral element when compared to pastures
   of moderate and heavy grazing intensity. The highest concentration of
   total nitrogen in the soil (0.71\%) was recorded on plots of heavy
   grazing intensity. The results of the study indicate that moderate
   grazing intensity, from 1 to 1.5 sheep ha(-1), can be recommended on the
   northern Adriatic islands. This should contribute not only to the
   preservation of plant diversity, but also to the improvement of
   ecological sheep farming.}},

Title = {{The impact of grazing management on Orthoptera abundance varies over the

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},

Abstract = {{As semi-natural grassland has a high level of biological diversity,
   understanding the effects of grazing and its variation over time is
   important in order to identify sustainable grazing practices. We
   measured temporal variation in Orthoptera abundance and spatial
   vegetation structure during seasonal grazing in an extensive
   sheep-farming system. We studied five grazed pasture areas (pre-grazing
   and post-grazing) and two adjacent ungrazed grasslands. We recorded the
   total abundance of Orthoptera and described the vegetation structure of
   175 replicate plots (25 per pasture/grassland) during six field sampling
   sessions. We demonstrated that the impact of grazing on Orthoptera
   abundance is species-specific and greatly varies over the grazing
   season. The decrease of phytovolume is significant after 4-7 weeks of
   sheep grazing. Total Orthoptera abundance was higher in pre-grazed plots
   than in ungrazed plots, and higher in ungrazed plots than in post-grazed
   plots. These differences were particularly high during the peak of adult
   abundance. No difference in species richness was observed between
   grazing intensities. Total Orthoptera abundance positively correlated to
   phytovolume only when grazing pressure was high. However, the
   relationship between abundance and phytovolume differed between species.
   Extensive grazing by sheep tends to homogenize spatial vegetation
   structure and to temporarily reduce total Orthoptera abundance at
   pasture scale. However, rotational grazing allows spatial and temporal
   heterogeneity in vegetation structure to be maintained at farm scale,
   heterogeneity that is beneficial for Orthoptera. In contrast, absence of
   grazing has a negative impact on Orthoptera abundance as it favours the
   accumulation of litter, which is detrimental for a high proportion of
   xerothermophilic Orthoptera associated with bare ground and short
   vegetation. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.}},

Abstract = {{Grazed pastures have been historically used in Japan for animal
   production with little concern to biodiversity. However, pasturing has
   significant effects on biodiversity and productivity because it produces
   gaps in the distribution of vegetation due to animal activities. We
   hypothesized that different grazing activities would have effects on the
   diversity of plant species and forage quality in different ways and that
   the sward type would modify these effects. Therefore, we attempted to
   predict the diversity of plant species and changes in total nutrient
   content per area at the time since treatment on the basis of simulations
   of cattle activities in three pastures with different vegetation
   compositions. We created three ground types (grazed areas, cleared
   ground, and undisturbed areas) in three pastures (improved, partially
   improved semi-natural, and semi-natural pasture) and recorded the
   percentage cover of each plant within the plots. We repeatedly
   calculated the biodiversity indices from these community data by varying
   the sampling probabilities for each ground type, which provided us with
   the expected species diversity indices with the changing proportions of
   each ground type. Furthermore, we investigated the dry matter and forage
   qualities. For improved and partially improved semi-natural pasture, our
   models predicted that plant diversity increased as a saturating function
   of the proportion of cleared ground and grazed area relative to the
   undisturbed area, although our models also showed exponential curves for
   the semi-natural pasture. Forage samples from cleared ground plots and
   semi-natural pasture had the lowest forage quality among all pastures.
   Based on the predicted effects of cattle pasturing on the plant species
   biodiversity and forage quality, it may be more beneficial to maintain a
   small proportion of cleared ground in the improved pasture during
   intensive grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Roots and root-derived C compounds are increasingly recognised as
   important resources for soil animal food webs. We used C-13-labelled
   glucose as a model C compound representing root exudates to follow the
   incorporation of root-derived C into the soil animal food web of a
   temperate grassland over a period of 52 weeks. We investigated
   variations in glucose C incorporation with fertilizer addition and sward
   composition, i.e. variations in plant functional groups. The approach
   allowed the differentiation of trophic chains based on primary
   decomposers feeding on litter and phytophagous species feeding on roots
   (i.e. not incorporating glucose C) from those based on secondary
   decomposers feeding on microorganisms (thereby assimilating glucose C).
   Each of the studied soil animal species incorporated glucose C,
   indicating that the majority of grassland soil animal species rely on
   microorganisms as food resources with microorganisms being fuelled by
   root exudates. However, incorporation of glucose C into soil animal
   species varied markedly with species identity, suggesting that
   detritivorous microarthropods complement each other in channelling
   microbial C through soil food webs. Fertilizer addition markedly reduced
   the concentration of glucose C in most soil animal species as well as
   the absolute transfer of glucose C into oribatid mites as major
   secondary decomposers. The results suggest that fertilizer addition
   shifts the basis of the decomposer food web towards the use of
   unlabelled resources, presumably roots, i.e. towards a herbivore system,
   thereby lessening the link between microorganisms and microbial grazers
   and hampering the propagation of microbial C to higher trophic levels.}},

Abstract = {{Temporal and spatial patterns of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and
   glomalin and soil enzyme activities were investigated in different
   managed semiarid steppes located in Inner Mongolia, North China. Soils
   were sampled in a depth up to 30 cm from non-grazed, overgrazed, and
   naturally restored steppes from June to September. Roots of Leymus
   chinense (Trin.) Tzvel. and Stipagrandis P. Smirn. were also collected
   over the same period. Results showed that overgrazing significantly
   decreased the total mycorrhizal colonization of S. grandis; total
   colonization of L. chinensis roots was not significantly different in
   the three managed steppes. Nineteen AMF species belonging to six genera
   were isolated. Funneliformis and Glomus were dominant genera in all
   three steppes. Spore density and species richness were mainly influenced
   by an interaction between plant growth stage and management system (P <
   0.001). Spore densities were higher in 0-10-cm soil depth. AMF species
   richness was significantly positively correlated with soil acid
   phosphatase activity, alkaline phosphatase activity, and two
   Bradford-reactive soil protein (BRSP) fractions (P < 0.01). It is
   concluded that the dynamics of AMF have highly temporal and spatial
   patterns that are related to soil glomalin and phosphatase activity in
   different managed semiarid steppes. Based on these observations, AMF
   communities could be useful indicators for evaluating soil quality and
   function of semiarid grassland ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The three main landscape dynamics now underway in Europe urban sprawl,
   agricultural intensification and rural abandonment are observed in a
   Catalan study area located in an edge environment between a metropolitan
   fringe and two natural protected sites. In this context, ecological
   connectivity becomes a key to host biodiversity. By applying to the
   available land cover maps several landscape metrics and modelling, we
   perform a historical landscape analysis of the changes experienced in
   land-use patterns and ecological processes. The results show up the
   relevant connectivity role played by the traditional agro-forest mosaics
   that linked both sides of the edge, providing a heterogeneous but
   continuous land matrix able to maintain high species richness. However
   these agro-forest mosaics are currently disappearing due to the ongoing
   urban sprawl and agricultural intensification in the plain, and
   reforestation leading to rural abandonment in the mountains. The current
   location of Mediterranean orchids in the study area is used to
   demonstrate that the results obtained through the ecological landscape
   assessment are not an analytical construct, but reflect the actual loss
   of meadows and open grazing spaces formerly created in woodland areas by
   a traditional multiple-use of forest and pastures now abandoned. The
   results show up that recovering the historical dynamics behind the
   current land-use patterns is a necessity for the emerging approaches to
   integrated biological conservation seeking a more complex and
   multidimensional management of sustainable cultural landscapes. (C) 2014

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{645-657}},

Abstract = {{Questions(1) Does grassland vegetation differ in its taxonomic,
   phylogenetic and functional alpha diversity between strictly grazed
   parcels (SGP) and mowed-and-grazed parcels (MGP)? (2) Do we observe
   differences in the responses of functional diversity (reflecting
   differences in the interspecific variation of a trait in the plant
   community) and community-weighted mean trait values (CWMs, reflecting
   the characteristics of the dominant species)? (3) How do diversity and
   CWM patterns respond to disturbance and fertilization gradients measured
   by agronomic descriptors in both parcel types?
   LocationFrench Jura Mountains.
   MethodsWe compared taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversities
   (based on Rao quadratic entropy) and CWMs between the two management
   types (SGP and MGP). We then used agronomic variables, describing both
   defoliation regime and fertilization intensity over the past 10yrs to
   explain diversity indices and CWMs in a partial redundancy analysis
   (pRDA).
   ResultsTaxonomic and phylogenetic diversities were higher in SGP than in
   MGP, as well as functional diversity computed for qualitative traits
   (clonal growth organs and leaf distribution along the stem). Contrary to
   expectations from literature, we found higher CWM for leaf dry matter
   content (LDMC) in intensively and regularly cut grasslands compared to
   only grazed grasslands, which can be explained by the higher dominance
   of grass species in hay meadows. In addition, constrained ordination
   revealed that taxonomic, phylogenetic and some functional diversity
   metrics were negatively affected by defoliation intensity (mowing
   frequency), while most CWMs were mainly influenced by fertilization
   intensity, either by the available N input or by the role of commercial
   inorganic fertilizers, depending on the trait considered.
   ConclusionsOur study revealed consistent patterns between the various
   facets of biodiversity in grasslands according to the main management
   regime. Taking agronomic gradients into account suggests the importance
   of considering both CWMs and functional diversity, which respond
   variously to agricultural practices. Conservation of high diversity in
   grasslands, whatever the facet considered, implies keeping some parcels
   exclusively grazed and limiting N inputs, especially those from
   inorganic commercial fertilizers.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing represents one of the most common disturbances in drylands
   worldwide, affecting both ecosystem structure and functioning. Despite
   the efforts to understand the nature and magnitude of grazing effects on
   ecosystem components and processes, contrasting results continue to
   arise. This is particularly remarkable for the biological soil crust
   (BSC) communities (i.e., cyanobacteria, lichens, and bryophytes), which
   play an important role in soil dynamics. Here we evaluated
   simultaneously the effect of grazing impact on BSC communities
   (resistance) and recovery after livestock exclusion (resilience) in a
   semiarid grassland of Central Mexico. In particular, we examined BSC
   species distribution, species richness, taxonomical group cover (i.e.,
   cyanobacteria, lichen, bryophyte), and composition along a disturbance
   gradient with different grazing regimes (low, medium, high impact) and
   along a recovery gradient with differently aged livestock exclosures
   (short-, medium-, long-term exclusion). Differences in grazing impact
   and time of recovery from grazing both resulted in slight changes in
   species richness; however, there were pronounced shifts in species
   composition and group cover. We found we could distinguish four highly
   diverse and dynamic BSC species groups: (1) species with high resistance
   and resilience to grazing, (2) species with high resistance but low
   resilience, (3) species with low resistance but high resilience, and (4)
   species with low resistance and resilience. While disturbance resulted
   in a nova diversity configuration, which may profoundly affect ecosystem
   functioning, we observed that 10 years of disturbance removal did not
   lead to the ecosystem structure found after 27 years of recovery. These
   findings are an important contribution to our understanding of BCS
   dynamics from a species and community perspective placed in a land use
   change context.}},

Abstract = {{Wooded grasslands are the most widespread agro-forestry systems in
   Europe, and are included in the Natura 2000 network due to their
   importance in biodiversity conservation. Similar to many man-made
   systems, long-term wooded grasslands conservation depends on sustainable
   use practices. Regeneration of the tree layer is indispensable to assure
   wooded grassland maintenance. Several studies in Spanish dehesas and
   Portuguese montados generated concerns regarding the long-term
   conservation of these agro-silvo-pastoral systems. In the present study,
   we tested if tree regeneration issues documented for the Iberian
   Peninsula also affected wooded grasslands located in another
   Mediterranean area inside and outside Natura 2000 network. The size
   structure of Quercus suber L. stands, and the abundance and height of
   seedlings and saplings were determined at farm and landscape scales, in
   grazed, grazed and tilled wooded grasslands, and non-grazed woodlands to
   test the compatibility of management type for tree regeneration. A
   frequency model of size structure was calculated to estimate the
   probability of cork oak stand survival in a medium and long term time
   period. New evidences of a generalised absence of regeneration in grazed
   wooded grasslands emerged from all the study sites. Some management
   practices are indicated for the long-term conservation of the habitat.

Abstract = {{Understanding the ecological mechanisms that constrain forest succession
   in tropical degraded anthropogenic grasslands is a prerequisite for the
   design of techniques for restoring biodiversity and ecosystem processes.
   In this context, succession on post-agricultural lands may be arrested
   by a variety of site-specific biotic and abiotic factors. Here we
   synthesise our research on the effects of five biotic factors (seed
   dispersal, development of a soil seed bank, seedling emergence,
   herbivory, competition) and five abiotic factors (fire, microclimatic
   conditions, soil nutrients, water availability, disturbance) as
   constraints to forest succession on degraded anthropogenic grasslands in
   a tropical lower montane forest landscape in Sri Lanka. The aim of this
   research was to deduce ecologically and socially acceptable restoration
   techniques to accelerate forest recovery. Colonisation of grasslands by
   trees is constrained by limited seed dispersal from adjacent remnant
   forest patches and their incorporation into grassland soil seed banks.
   For the few tree seeds that are dispersed into grasslands, a combination
   of vertebrate herbivory and annual dry season fires reduces the
   likelihood that they emerge as seedlings. Removal of the grass canopy by
   clipping or tilling increases the emergence of woody plant seedlings
   close to the boundaries of forest patches, but has no effect beyond 20 m
   into the established grassland. Our research shows that isolation of
   seedling root systems from those of competing grasses increases the
   growth and survival of tree seedlings transplanted directly into
   grassland swards, while above-ground competition and exclusion of
   vertebrate herbivores has no effects on seedling growth and survival.
   These experiments identified that the early-successional species
   Macaranga indica Wight and Symplocos cochinchinensis (Lour.) S. Moore
   are potential candidates for use in reforestation programmes on
   abandoned grasslands. We propose a strategy for a model forest
   restoration programme based on the creation of vegetation islands using
   early-successional native tree species, the application of a tilling
   treatment around remnant forest patches, creation of fire breaks around
   vegetation islands, and the protection of isolated individual trees and
   tree patches within established grasslands. We highlight the importance
   of further research on the ecology and biology of seed dispersers and
   seed predators, and expansion of knowledge on the regeneration traits of
   native tree species, for future refinements of this restoration
   strategy. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{AimWe analysed the effects of grazing on the diversity and structure of
   dung beetle communities to see whether the biogeographical and
   ecological contexts influence dung beetle responses. We hypothesized
   that the responses of dung beetle communities are modulated by both the
   ecological conditions resulting from the transformation of native
   vegetation into grazing areas, and the history of the species inhabiting
   different biogeographical provinces.
   LocationThe state of Hidalgo, in the Mexican Transition Zone, central
   Mexico.
   MethodsWe used a standardized hierarchical sampling procedure in three
   biogeographical provinces located in Hidalgo. Within each province, we
   identified the dominant vegetation types, and within these we identified
   the sites with native vegetation and those modified by grazing. The
   design included 800 baited pitfall traps, and allowed us to study the
   response of dung beetle communities with different biogeographical
   histories to ecological context.
   ResultsWe captured 8707 beetles belonging to 37 species and 17 genera in
   the subfamily Scarabaeinae. We found that grazing areas only had a
   negative effect on dung beetle diversity in tropical forest; conversely,
   in dry environments (pine-oak forest and xerophilous scrubland)
   diversity in grazing areas was higher than in the native vegetation
   sites. We did not detect a clear effect in cloud forest sites. Species
   turnover between the native vegetation and pastures was high locally,
   and low over larger spatial scales (vegetation type or biogeographical
   province). In all four vegetation types grazing was associated with
   differences in dung beetle community composition.
   Main conclusionsThe impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity is
   dependent to a considerable degree on the local ecological conditions
   and the biogeographical context that has shaped the composition of
   communities over time.}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of most temperate grassland habitats and their
   characteristic fauna and flora requires regular low-intensive forms of
   land-use to counteract natural succession. Although many species
   tolerate moderate disturbance regimes, some are known to be susceptible
   to grazing or mowing, thereby causing a management dilemma. One of these
   species is the Woodland Ringlet butterfly, Erebia medusa. In this study,
   we analysed which environmental factors determine the occurrence of E.
   medusa in the Diemel Valley (Central Germany). Furthermore, we conducted
   microclimatic measurements during the winter months to investigate the
   role of the litter layer as a microclimatic buffer. Patch occupancy in
   the Diemel Valley was well explained by the amount of litter present in
   a patch and connectivity to other inhabited patches. The role of local
   climatic conditions could not be clarified, due to inter-correlations
   with connectivity. During the winter, the air temperature inside the
   litter layer was significantly less variable than above it. We conclude
   that the current distribution of E. medusa in the Diemel Valley is
   caused by the combined effect of habitat quality and connectivity, and
   perhaps also by climatic factors. The importance of the litter layer
   reflects the dependence of E. medusa on low-intensive or absent
   land-use. In addition, the litter layer possibly constitutes an
   essential habitat element, as it buffers temperature fluctuations and
   thus probably reduces the energy consumption of overwintering larvae.
   Given the species' preference for abandoned grasslands, the conservation
   of E. medusa requires a low-intensity habitat management, for example,
   by rotational grazing or mowing of small parts of the sites. On the
   landscape level, the preservation of well-connected habitat networks is
   important.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive agriculture is often bad for wildlife. Does this imply that a
   goal to boost wildlife on agricultural land is best met through a
   general reduction in intensity? We argue that such an approach may not
   be optimal, since cost functions for provision of wildlife on
   agricultural land may be non-convex, due to fixed costs associated with
   such provision. This implies that, even when farms are identical, it may
   be preferable to split them into groups of high providers and low
   providers. We test our hypothesis in a study of the optimal management
   of mown grasslands in southern Sweden, where the two products are silage
   and successful reproduction of ground-nesting birds, and the variable
   controlled by the farmer is the date of the first mowing. We show that
   the optimal solution is likely to involve some farmers maintaining
   profit-maximizing practices while other-identical-farmers delay their
   first mowing significantly. The superiority of such split solutions may

Title = {{Sheep and wolves: Is the occurrence of large predators a limiting factor

Abstract = {{Extensive sheep grazing in the West Carpathians is a very important
   management tool for the protection of the traditional landscape
   character of the Central European countryside, as well as providing
   biologically valuable habitats of pastures and meadows. In this paper we
   describe the main characteristics of sheep farming in the Beskydy region
   and test the hypothesis that large carnivores are a limiting factor for
   sheep grazing management of landscapes in this region, the only area of
   the Czech Republic where all three species of large European carnivores
   - the Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx), grey wolf (Canis lupus) and brown bear
   (Ursus arctos) - occur. Data obtained from the monitoring of large
   carnivores and a questionnaire-based survey of the perspective of sheep
   farmers in the Beskydy region were analysed. Although the lynx is the
   most abundant large predator within the study area, the highest number
   of attacks on sheep was attributed to wolves. However, the annual
   frequency of attacks was very low and, moreover, an important number of
   the attacks could have been committed by dogs rather than wolves. From
   the perspective of sheep breeders, the major economic factor is a low
   consumer demand for sheep products, and not the presence of large
   carnivores. However farmers expressed a view that some level of
   safeguarding was needed and this should come in the form of financial
   compensation for damage resulting from attacks on sheep by large
   predators and a modification of the current system of agricultural
   subsidies. Subsidies for sheep breeders should respect the regional
   specifics including the risk arising from the presence of large
   carnivores and provide support for active measures to protect the
   livestock against them. Regarding the protection of populations of large
   carnivores in the Beskydy Mountains, it will be necessary to continue to
   monitor their presence. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{How Ecosystem Services Knowledge and Values Influence Farmers'
   Decision-Making}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 30}},
Abstract = {{The ecosystem services (ES) concept has emerged and spread widely
   recently, to enhance the importance of preserving ecosystems through
   global change in order to maintain their benefits for human well-being.
   Numerous studies consider various dimensions of the interactions between
   ecosystems and land use via ES, but integrated research addressing the
   complete feedback loop between biodiversity, ES and land use has
   remained mostly theoretical. Few studies consider feedbacks from
   ecosystems to land use systems through ES, exploring how ES are taken
   into account in land management decisions. To fill this gap, we carried
   out a role-playing game to explore how ES cognition mediates feedbacks
   from environmental change on farmers' behaviors in a mountain grassland
   system. On a close to real landscape game board, farmers were faced with
   changes in ES under climatic and socio-economic scenarios and prompted
   to plan for the future and to take land management decisions as they
   deemed necessary. The outcomes of role-playing game were complemented
   with additional agronomic and ecological data from interviews and
   fieldwork. The effects of changes in ES on decision were mainly direct,
   i.e. not affecting knowledge and values, when they constituted
   situations with which farmers were accustomed. For example, a reduction
   of forage quantity following droughts led farmers to shift from mowing
   to grazing. Sometimes, ES cognitions were affected by ES changes or by
   external factors, leading to an indirect feedback. This happened when
   fertilization was stopped after farmers learned that it was inefficient
   in a drought context. Farmers' behaviors did not always reflect their
   attitudes towards ES because other factors including topographic
   constraints, social value of farming or farmer individual and household
   characteristics also influenced land-management decisions. Those results
   demonstrated the interest to take into account the complete feedback
   loop between ES and land management decisions to favor more sustainable
   ES management.}},

Title = {{Traditional vs Modern: Role of Breed Type in Determining Enteric Methane
   Emissions from Cattle Grazing as Part of Contrasting Grassland-Based
   Systems}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Ruminant livestock turn forages and poor-quality feeds into human edible
   products, but enteric methane (CH4) emissions from ruminants are a
   significant contributor to greenhouse gases (GHGs) and hence to climate
   change. Despite the predominance of pasture-based beef production
   systems in many parts of Europe there are little data available
   regarding enteric CH4 emissions from free-ranging grazing cattle. It is
   possible that differences in physiology or behaviour could influence
   comparative emissions intensities for traditional and modern breed types
   depending on the nutritional characteristics of the herbage grazed. This
   study investigated the role of breed type in influencing CH4 emissions
   from growing beef steers managed on contrasting grasslands typical of
   intensive (lowland) and extensive (upland) production systems. Using the
   SF6 dilution technique CH4 emissions were estimated for a modern,
   fast-growing crossbred (Limousin cross) and a smaller and hardier native
   breed (Welsh Black) when grazing lowland perennial ryegrass (high
   nutritional density, low sward heterogeneity) and semi-improved upland
   pasture (low/medium nutritional density, high sward heterogeneity).
   Live-weight gain was substantially lower for steers on the upland system
   compared to the lowland system (0.31 vs. 1.04 kg d(-1); s.e.d. = 0.085
   kg d(-1); P < 0.001), leading to significant differences in estimated
   dry matter intakes (8.0 vs. 11.1 kg DM d(-1) for upland and lowland
   respectively; s.e.d. = 0.68 kg DM d(-1); P < 0.001). While emissions per
   unit feed intake were similar for the lowland and upland systems, CH4
   emissions per unit of live-weight gain (LWG) were substantially higher
   when the steers grazed the poorer quality hill pasture (760 vs 214 g
   kg(-1) LWG; s.e.d. = 133.5 g kg(-1) LWG; P < 0.001). Overall any effects
   of breed type were relatively small relative to the combined influence
   of pasture type and location.}},

Title = {{Plant Diversity Impacts Decomposition and Herbivory via Changes in
   Aboveground Arthropods}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Loss of plant diversity influences essential ecosystem processes as
   aboveground productivity, and can have cascading effects on the
   arthropod communities in adjacent trophic levels. However, few studies
   have examined how those changes in arthropod communities can have
   additional impacts on ecosystem processes caused by them (e. g.
   pollination, bioturbation, predation, decomposition, herbivory).
   Therefore, including arthropod effects in predictions of the impact of
   plant diversity loss on such ecosystem processes is an important but
   little studied piece of information. In a grassland biodiversity
   experiment, we addressed this gap by assessing aboveground decomposer
   and herbivore communities and linking their abundance and diversity to
   rates of decomposition and herbivory. Path analyses showed that
   increasing plant diversity led to higher abundance and diversity of
   decomposing arthropods through higher plant biomass. Higher species
   richness of decomposers, in turn, enhanced decomposition. Similarly,
   species-rich plant communities hosted a higher abundance and diversity
   of herbivores through elevated plant biomass and C:N ratio, leading to
   higher herbivory rates. Integrating trophic interactions into the study
   of biodiversity effects is required to understand the multiple pathways
   by which biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning.}},

   Experimental Test in California Grasslands}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The concept of ecosystem services - the benefits that nature provides to
   human's society - has gained increasing attention over the past decade.
   Increasing global abiotic and biotic change, including species
   invasions, is threatening the secure delivery of these ecosystem
   services. Efficient evaluation methods of ecosystem services are
   urgently needed to improve our ability to determine management
   strategies and restoration goals in face of these new emerging
   ecosystems. Considering a range of multiple ecosystem functions may be a
   useful way to determine such strategies. We tested this framework
   experimentally in California grasslands, where large shifts in species
   composition have occurred since the late 1700's. We compared a suite of
   ecosystem functions within one historic native and two non-native
   species assemblages under different grazing intensities to address how
   different species assemblages vary in provisioning, regulatory and
   supporting ecosystem services. Forage production was reduced in one
   non-native assemblage (medusahead). Cultural ecosystem services, such as
   native species diversity, were inherently lower in both non-native
   assemblages, whereas most other services were maintained across grazing
   intensities. All systems provided similar ecosystem services under the
   highest grazing intensity treatment, which simulated unsustainable
   grazing intensity. We suggest that applying a more comprehensive
   ecosystem framework that considers multiple ecosystem services to
   evaluate new emerging ecosystems is a valuable tool to determine
   management goals and how to intervene in a changing ecosystem.}},

Title = {{Resource-Mediated Indirect Effects of Grassland Management on Arthropod
   Diversity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Intensive land use is a driving force for biodiversity decline in many
   ecosystems. In semi-natural grasslands, land-use activities such as
   mowing, grazing and fertilization affect the diversity of plants and
   arthropods, but the combined effects of different drivers and the chain
   of effects are largely unknown. In this study we used structural
   equation modelling to analyse how the arthropod communities in managed
   grasslands respond to land use and whether these responses are mediated
   through changes in resource diversity or resource quantity (biomass).
   Plants were considered resources for herbivores which themselves were
   considered resources for predators. Plant and arthropod (herbivores and
   predators) communities were sampled on 141 meadows, pastures and mown
   pastures within three regions in Germany in 2008 and 2009. Increasing
   land-use intensity generally increased plant biomass and decreased plant
   diversity, mainly through increasing fertilization. Herbivore diversity
   decreased together with plant diversity but showed no response to
   changes in plant biomass. Hence, land-use effects on herbivore diversity
   were mediated through resource diversity rather than quantity. Land-use
   effects on predator diversity were mediated by both herbivore diversity
   (resource diversity) and herbivore quantity (herbivore biomass), but
   indirect effects through resource quantity were stronger. Our findings
   highlight the importance of assessing both direct and indirect effects
   of land-use intensity and mode on different trophic levels. In addition
   to the overall effects, there were subtle differences between the
   different regions, pointing to the importance of regional land-use
   specificities. Our study underlines the commonly observed strong effect
   of grassland land use on biodiversity. It also highlights that
   mechanistic approaches help us to understand how different land-use
   modes affect biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Alpine Alnus viridis (=Alnus alnobetula) communities were studied. A
   total of 306 phytosociological releves of Austrian, French, German,
   Italian and Swiss alpine regions were analysed. Data analysis showed the
   existence of two associations distinguished on an ecological basis. The
   first agrees with the classic description of Alnetum viridis found on
   hygronitrophilous soils in avalanche gullies and moderately steep slopes
   and is characterized by perennial tall herbs. The second, proposed as
   new association Rhododendro ferruginei-Alnetum viridis, colonizes
   mesoacidophilous soils on moderate slopes and disused pastures and is
   characterized by shrubby invasive species. The association's variability
   was also examined. Four subunits were identified, distinguished by
   ecological factors. Comparison tests and constrained ordination of the
   ecological features (i.e. geomorphology, biodiversity, Ellenberg's
   indicator values) allowed the discrimination of the main ecological
   factors that affect the distinction of the coenoses. These were soil
   reaction, water and soil nitrogen availability, slope, altitude and the
   influence of grazing. The absence of biogeographical influences and its
   biodiversity contribution are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Alpine plants of the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (Sichuan, China)
   are developed under long-lasting grazing by wild and domestic yaks.
   Among morphological features of plants, life forms may reflect their
   adaptation to grazing. We studied life-form composition of four typical
   communities within the alpine belt (3930-3960m a.s.l.) subjected to
   grazing of various intensity: alpine fen (heavily grazed), alpine shrub
   meadow (heavily grazed), Spiraea alpina thicket (grazed), and
   Rhododendron thicket (practically not grazed). The following
   morphological traits were studied: (1) life form according to Raunkiaer,
   (2) life form according to Serebryakov, (3) canopy structure, and (4)
   rate of lateral spreading. We derived life-form spectra based on (1) the
   number of species per life form and (2) the cumulative abundance of
   species which have the same life form. One-way ANOVA and nonparametric
   ANOVA were run to test for significance of differences between spectra.
   The studied communities differed significantly by the proportion of
   different life forms. The main life forms are caudex and short rhizome
   hemicryptophytes, nonclonal species, or species with a low rate of
   lateral spreading. Therophytes made up 10-11\% of the communities except
   in Rhododendron thickets, where such were absent. These life forms can
   indicate grazing in the study area.}},

Title = {{The growth form of dominant grasses regulates the invasibility of
   Uruguayan grasslands}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we report the results of a small-scale experiment on
   patches of natural grasslands in Uruguay. We analyzed whether growth
   form of C-4 grasses affects invasion success. The experimental plots
   represented three patch-types arising from short-term grazing effects
   and were dominated by prostrate C-4 grasses, erect C-4 grasses and
   codominated by prostrate C-4 grasses and forbs. We seeded the plots with
   four exotic species: one perennial C-4 grass, one annual C-3 grass, one
   perennial forb and one annual legume. Contrary to many studies conducted
   at small spatial scales, our results suggest that in our system, the
   processes that control invasibility are not directly linked with
   resident species richness or biomass, but rather are driven by growth
   form. Emergence of invaders did not differ among patch-types, but
   seedlings survived less in plots dominated by erect grasses. We suggest
   that the erect growth form of C-4 grass species is more successful in
   preventing invasion by mediating seedling competition for light under
   the canopy for a longer period of time. Grazing management, through its
   ability to regulate canopy architecture, is a potentially important tool
   in controlling invasion.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Litter-removing disturbances such as fire in grasslands temporarily
   increase available resources for plants, opening a window of opportunity
   for new establishment as communities recover. At this time, new
   individuals or species could be added to the community as a result of
   germination from the local seed bank. In reconstructed grasslands this
   may be problematic, as the seed bank may contain a suite of undesired
   species reflective of prior and surrounding land uses. In two,
   25-year-old, low-diversity reconstructed grasslands, we tested the
   effect of local seed bank establishment following litter-removing
   disturbance using seedling removal plots (1m(2)) and plots where natural
   seedling establishment was allowed. Following disturbance, the
   vegetation was either left intact or hayed to enhance seedling
   establishment (a common practice following inter-seeding efforts).
   Although the seed bank and seedling community were dominated by resident
   grasses (Andropogon gerardii and Poa pratensis), recruitment from the
   seed bank increased species richness and reduced evenness through the
   addition of forb species (including Cirsium arvense) in one of the study
   sites. Haying temporarily altered the abundances of the dominant
   grasses, but did not consistently affect seedling recruitment.
   Disturbances that facilitate seed bank recruitment may promote
   establishment of undesired species within reconstructed grassland
   communities, and we need to take steps to better manage the
   contributions into and recruitment from the seed bank to reconstruct
   sustainable grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of native rainforest ecosystems in Limon Province of Costa
   Rica to banana and pineapple monoculture has led to reductions in
   biodiversity and soil quality. Agroforestry management of cacao
   (Theobroma cacao) is an alternative system that may maintain the
   agricultural livelihood of the region while more closely mimicking
   native ecosystems. This study compared physical, biological and chemical
   soil quality indicators of a cacao plantation under organic agroforestry
   management with banana, pineapple, and pasture systems; a native forest
   nearby served as a control. For bulk density and earthworm analysis, 18
   samples were collected between March and April 2012 from each ecosystem
   paired with 18 samples from the cacao. Cacao had a lower bulk density
   than banana and pineapple monocultures, but greater than the forest
   (p<0.05). Cacao also hosted a greater number and mass of earthworms than
   banana and pineapple (p<0.05), but similar to forest and pasture. For
   soil chemical characteristics, three composite samples were collected in
   March 2012 from each agroecosystem paired with three samples from the
   cacao plantation. Forest and pineapple ecosystems had the lowest pH,
   cation exchange capacity, and exchangeable nutrient cations, while cacao
   had the greatest (p<0.05). Total nutrient levels of P and N were
   slightly greater in banana, pineapple and pasture than in cacao;
   probably related to addition of chemical fertilizer and manure from
   cattle grazing. Forest and cacao also had greater \%C, than other
   ecosystems, which is directly related to soil organic matter content
   (p<0.0001). Overall, cacao had more favorable physical, biological and
   chemical soil characteristics than banana and pineapple monocultures,
   while trends were less conclusive compared to the pastureland. While
   organic cacao was inferior to native forest in some soil characteristics
   such as bulk density and organic carbon, its soil quality did best mimic
   that of the native forest. This supports the organic cultivation of
   cacao as a desirable alternative to banana and pineapple monoculture.}},

Abstract = {{Invertebrates are rarely considered when designing protected areas, and
   their biodiversity patterns in these areas are almost always unknown. We
   studied the spatial and temporal diversity of Ichneumonidae in five
   selected habitats of Cabaneros National Park: grazing pastureland,
   shrubland, and three types of woodland (Pyrenean oak, cork oak, and ash
   woodlands). We focused on 11 subfamilies, with species classified into
   trophic guilds. The highest diversity and richness of Ichneumonidae were
   found in ash woodland and pastureland, each with similar structural
   habitat complexity. Species turnover between habitats was about 50\% and
   it contributed more to the total species richness than the fauna
   inherent to the habitats, though less to the total species diversity.
   Shrubland is transitional between pasture and woodland and Ichneumonidae
   assemblages in this habitat are rather different in their species
   composition from the others. Parasitoids of phytophages are well
   represented in all habitats; other guilds are more related to specific
   habitats, e.g. parasitoids of xylophages in shrubland. We suggest that
   shrub may be invading and isolating some of the woodlands. The mosaic
   landscape of the National Park, including open areas, is essential to
   ensure the conservation of parasitoids.}},

Abstract = {{Andean grasslands ecosystems are fragile environments with rigorous
   climatologic conditions and low and variable food for the grazing. The
   Apolobamba area is located in the Bolivian Andean Mountains. Its high
   grasslands provide a natural habitat for wild and domestic camelids such
   as vicuna (Vicugna vicugna) and alpaca (Lama pacos). The botanical
   diversity plays an essential role in maintaining vital ecosystem
   functions. The objectives of this research were to determine the
   seasonal changes in soil properties, to study the vegetation changes
   during the wet and dry seasons and the influence of soil properties and
   camelid densities on the vegetation in the Apolobamba grasslands. Four
   zones with different vicuna populations were selected to be studied. The
   following soil parameters were determined: total organic carbon, total
   nitrogen, available phosphorous, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable
   cations, pH and texture. The vegetation season changes were studied
   through botanical identification, above-ground biomass, plant cover and
   species richness. Results showed that some soil properties such as C/N
   ratio, CEC, silt and clay percentages kept stable against the seasonal
   changes. Generally, soil nutrients were relatively higher during the dry
   season in the surface and subsurface. The results did not point out the
   predominant vegetation growth during the wet season. The seasonal
   vegetation growth depended on each species. The good soil fertility
   corresponded to the highest plant cover. Soil fertility presented no
   influence on the above-ground biomass of the collected species. The
   negative influence of camelid grazing on soil properties could not be
   assessed. However, overgrazing could affect some plant species.
   Therefore, protection is needed in order to preserve the biodiversity in
   the Andean mountain grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated whether species richness, diversity and density of
   understory herbaceous plants differed along logging (gap) and grazing
   (primarily by cattle) disturbance gradients, and sought to identify
   drivers of richness, diversity and density of understory vegetation of
   logged sites. A factorial experiment was conducted in the mixed conifer
   forest of Gidakom in Western Bhutan. Levels of the logging treatment
   included small (0.15-0.24 ha), medium (0.25-0.35 ha) and large
   (0.36-1.31 ha) gaps. The grazing treatment included grazed (primarily by
   cattle) and ungrazed (where herbivores were excluded by a fence) plots
   nested within each gap. Data were collected from 12 gaps (4 replicates
   at each level of logging) using the point intercept method. Shannon
   Weaver Diversity and Margalef's indices were used to estimate species
   diversity and describe species richness, respectively. Soil samples were
   analyzed for pH and nutrients. The interaction effect of logging and
   grazing was significant (pa parts per thousand currency sign0.001) only
   on species diversity. Relative to ungrazed areas, species diversity was
   significantly higher (0.01a parts per thousand currency signpa parts per
   thousand currency sign0.05) in medium grazed gaps. Under grazed
   conditions, soil P was negatively correlated with gap size and species
   diversity. While species diversity was positively correlated (0.01a
   parts per thousand currency signpa parts per thousand currency sign0.05)
   with soil N in grazed plots species richness was positively correlated
   (0.001a parts per thousand currency signpa parts per thousand currency
   sign0.01) with soil N in ungrazed plots. Relative density of Yushania
   microphylla and Carex nubigena were higher under ungrazed conditions.
   Our study suggests that the combined effect of cattle grazing and
   logging results in higher species diversity of understory vegetation in
   medium and grazed gaps in mixed conifer forests of Bhutan,whereas
   increase or decrease in relative density of major species is determined
   primarily by the independent effects of grazing and logging. From
   management perspective, forest managers must refrain from creating large
   gaps to avoid loss of nutrients (mainly P and N), which may eventually
   affect tree regeneration. Managers intending to maintain understory
   vegetation diversity must consider the combined effects of grazing and
   logging, ensuring low to moderate grazing pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Research to understand and manage ecosystems to supply services has
   recently spurred a functional view of their biodiversity. In particular,
   approaches based on functional traits rather than species diversity are
   increasingly used to reflect interactions between organisms and their
   environment. These approaches bring a functional perspective to the
   study of community structure responses to disturbances and resources,
   and of their effects on ecosystem functioning and services. From an
   academic perspective, we propose a conceptual framework based on species
   functional traits to better infer how grassland management practices
   (fertilization, defoliation regime) along with abiotic factors influence
   plant, animal and microbial community composition and a range of
   services in grassland ecosystems. The core of the framework relies on
   combinations of plant functional traits and associated microbial
   features that specifically respond to environmental and management
   factors and influence ecosystem services. To overcome stakeholders'
   difficulty in applying the concept of functional traits, we propose an
   operational approach implying the mapping of plant communities
   distributed into five plant functional types (PFTs). The approach was
   used for fields in grassland-based livestock farms from two French
   grassland networks. We evaluated its ability to predict a range of
   services including forage provision and non-market services according to
   environmental and management drivers. PFT-based plant community
   composition predicted forage services reasonably well but responded
   weakly to environmental gradients. To cope with the observed limitations
   of current predictive approaches, we suggest including soil microbial
   functional types and adaptive management rather than using a
   prescriptive scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Fennoscandian calcareous wooded meadows have high conservation value due
   to very high diversity which has been maintained by consistent mowing,
   but undergo species loss when this management is abandoned. We compared
   species richness and composition of regularly mown and abandoned wooded
   meadows in Estonia and established species groups with respect to their
   response to abandonment. These meadows were very species rich with a
   maximum of 43 species per 0.25 m(2). Species whose populations are
   maintained by mowing constituted > 60 \% of the floristic diversity of
   the mown wooded meadows. Abandonment suppressed species with a
   preference for dry infertile open habitats. Response to abandonment was
   related to clonality, height and growth form. The greatest negative
   response was associated with low graminoids, short-lived and non-clonal
   species, rosette and semi-rosette growth form. Weak competitors with low
   height and light seeds exhibited a slow decline; perennial life span and
   clonality enable a delay in local extinction of these species. Response
   groups had similar persistence at a national level, revealing that
   earlier assessment of species dynamics at larger spatial scales could
   underestimate the number of threatened species. Application of
   restoration measures could avoid local extinctions of many
   mowing-supported species, whereas some of the mowing-dependent species
   likely need reintroduction.}},

Abstract = {{This study quantifies the impact of four different grazing regimes
   (heavy, moderate, light and ungrazed) on the vegetation dynamics of
   rangeland ecosystems along the southern boundary area of the Mu Us
   Desert, China. As the grazing intensities decreased, the soil quality,
   canopy cover, height, density, above-and below-ground biomass, litter,
   root/shoot ratio and native plant (Aneurolepidium dasystachys) and grass
   abundances significantly increased; the above-ground biomass of grasses
   increased, but the above-ground biomass of forbs decreased. Ungrazed
   grassland has significantly improved from grasslands experiencing three
   other levels of grazing pressure, especially in the grassland biomass.
   Species richness increased as the grazing intensity decreased in the
   grazing grasslands, but peak species richness appeared under moderate
   and light grazing against lower productivity. Grazing exclusion causes
   desirable transitions in plant communities of desert steppe rangelands.
   Therefore, appropriate and efficient grazing exclusion is an available
   way to counteract local grassland degradation and promote rangeland
   sustainability.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Have millennia of human land use fundamentally altered the
   vegetation of a large proportion of the high Andean puna biome, with
   natural vegetation now restricted to inaccessible areas? Can
   inaccessible ledges be used as surrogates to infer the potential natural
   vegetation (PNV) in heavily impacted areas of the puna ecosystem of the
   high Andes? Is there a difference in plant community composition and
   diversity between the potential natural puna vegetation, represented by
   areas inaccessible to grazing and burning, and the anthropogenically
   disturbed vegetation found on nearby, but accessible, slopes?
   Location: Abra Maalaga Private Conservation Area, Cusco, southern
   Peruvian Andes.
   Methods: Four study habitats were chosen that comprised ledges and
   slopes from within and outside of the conservation area. For each
   habitat, vegetation composition was recorded using eight to twelve 2 x
   2-m(2) plots studied for species cover and abiotic variables.
   Results: Analysis of species richness using two-way ANOVAs with Tukey
   test found that plots from the three habitats inaccessible to
   anthropogenic disturbance exhibited similar richness levels, whereas
   plots accessible to grazing and anthropogenic burning had significantly
   higher species richness. Likewise, CCA separated out plots of the three
   habitats inaccessible to anthropogenic disturbance from the unconserved
   slope plots. Species indicator analyses found the three inaccessible
   habitats to share the largest number of indicator species, with none
   being shared by the accessible, unconserved slope habitat. The PNV,
   inferred from the inaccessible vegetation, comprises a mosaic of
   Polylepis pepei woodland and tussock grassland, dominated by Festuca
   aff. procera, Luzula gigantea, Valeriana mandoniana and Carex
   pichinchensis.
   Conclusions: As both the conserved and unconserved ledge habitats
   contain a vegetation that approaches that of the conserved slope, ledges
   can be taken as a surrogate to infer the PNV in heavily impacted areas
   where no conserved slopes are available. From preliminary data, the
   presumed PNV of the study area corresponds to a distinct vegetation
   assemblage including species previously unknown to science. Adjacent
   disturbed, accessible land contained a higher species diversity, with a
   flora that may have originated from localized, disturbed natural
   habitats.}},

   methodology after 35 yr. At the local scale (0.25 ha), we analysed alpha
   diversity, site colonization and extinction rates, and changes in
   species and functional type composition. Site colonization rates were
   calculated separately for new species (not recorded in the original
   inventory) and old species (present in the first survey at other sample
   sites of the community). Correspondence analysis was applied to the
   presence/absence species matrix for all sites in both periods. At
   regional scale, we evaluated gamma diversity, heterogeneity within and
   between communities, changes in proportion of functional types (growth
   season, longevity and life form) and species origin.
   Results: In the mesophytic prairie, average local species richness
   increased 46\% and regional richness 28\%, while in the halophytic
   steppe changes were not significant. The colonization rate was higher
   and the extinction rate lower in the richest community (mesophytic
   prairie). Differences in colonization rates between natives and exotics
   were not found. Principal variability between sites in species
   composition was associated with abiotic conditions explaining 20.9\% of
   inertia, temporal changes were relegated to the second axis with 6.38\%.
   Proportions of warm-season exotics among new arrivals were higher than
   expected. Biotic homogenization was evidenced in the mesophytic prairie
   as a significant reduction in species turnover between sampling dates.
   Conclusions: After 35 yr under moderate grazing intensity we found
   increases in species richness, no biodiversity loss and no losses of
   native species. Instead of those species favoured by grazing, as
   expected, warm season species increased. Different grassland communities
   showed clear differences in richness changes, in degree of
   homogenization and in species turnover.}},

Abstract = {{Treelines are expected to rise to higher elevations with climate
   warming; the rate and extent however are still largely unknown. Here we
   present the first multi-proxy palaeoecological study from the treeline
   in the Northwestern Swiss Alps that covers the entire Holocene. We
   reconstructed climate, fire and vegetation dynamics at Iffigsee, an
   alpine lake at 2,065 m a.s.l., by using seismic sedimentary surveys,
   loss on ignition, visible spectrum reflectance spectroscopy, pollen,
   spore, macrofossil and charcoal analyses. Afforestation with Larix
   decidua and tree Betula (probably B. pendula) started at similar to
   9,800 cal. b.p., more than 1,000 years later than at similar elevations
   in the Central and Southern Alps, indicating cooler temperatures and/or
   a high seasonality. Highest biomass production and forest position of
   similar to 2,100-2,300 m a.s.l. are inferred during the Holocene Thermal
   Maximum from 7,000 to 5,000 cal. b.p. With the onset of pastoralism and
   transhumance at 6,800-6,500 cal. b.p., human impact became an important
   factor in the vegetation dynamics at Iffigsee. This early evidence of
   pastoralism is documented by the presence of grazing indicators (pollen,
   spores), as well as a wealth of archaeological finds at the nearby
   mountain pass of Schnidejoch. Human and fire impact during the Neolithic
   and Bronze Ages led to the establishment of pastures and facilitated the
   expansion of Picea abies and Alnus viridis. We expect that in mountain
   areas with land abandonment, the treeline will react quickly to future
   climate warming by shifting to higher elevations, causing drastic
   changes in species distribution and composition as well as severe
   biodiversity losses.}},

Abstract = {{Stoichiometric relations drive powerful constraints on many ecosystem
   processes. However, our understanding of the hierarchical responses of
   plant C:N:P stoichiometry at different levels of biological organization
   to global change factors remains limited.
   we examined the plant C:N:P stoichiometric responses to N deposition and
   mowing (hay making) at both species- and community-level by carrying out
   a 4-year field experiment in the temperate steppe of northern China.
   Our results showed that N addition and mowing resulted in higher plant N
   concentrations, lower C:N, and higher N:P at both species- and
   community-level. Mowing had a limited negative influence on the effects
   of N addition. We observed divergent responses of both plant P
   concentrations and C:P to N addition at species-level and
   community-level: N addition led to higher plant P and lower C:P at
   species-level, but this effect was not observed at the community-level.
   Our results indicate that stoichiometric responses at community-level to
   N addition and mowing diverge from more traditionally examined
   species-specific responses. Our results suggest that the hierarchical
   responses of plant stoichiometry to anthropogenic disturbance deserves
   more attention when we model the interactions of terrestrial ecosystem
   C, N, and P cycling under scenarios of increasing N availability
   concomitantly occurring with active land management.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Liverwort heath is considered in Scotland to be one of the
   vegetation types most vulnerable to environmental change, yet detailed
   insights into its dynamics are lacking.Aims: To assess the nature and
   extent of plant compositional changes in liverwort heath over 50 years
   and relate this to environmental change drivers.Methods: Vegetation
   plots previously recorded 20 and 50 years ago were re-surveyed to assess
   changes in species composition, plot-level species richness and
   between-plot variability, using several -diversity indices and
   partitioning. The environmental indicator values of the species that
   showed most change were used to identify the environmental drivers of
   change.Results: Liverwort heath in north-west Scotland has undergone
   compositional changes over 50 years, becoming more heterogeneous, and
   losing some of its distinct character. Dwarf shrubs and specialist
   liverworts have decreased, while graminoids have increased. Partitioning
   of change in diversity indicated that mainly changes in species
   richness, rather than species turnover, have driven the taxonomic
   differentiation over time. Grazing, eutrophication and warmer and drier
   conditions were found to be potentially important drivers of the
   observed vegetation change.Conclusions: Our results highlight the
   vulnerability of liverwort heath to environmental change.}},

   agricultural landscape}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{Non-native plant species can provide native generalist insects,
   including pests, with novel food and habitats. It is hypothesized that
   local and landscape-level abundances of non-native plants can affect the
   population size of generalist insects, although generalists are assumed
   to be less sensitive to habitat connectivity than specialists. In a
   heterogeneous landscape in Japan, the relationship between the density
   of a native pest of rice (Stenotus rubrovittatus (Matsumura)
   (Heteroptera: Miridae)) and the abundance of Italian ryegrass (Lolium
   multiflorum Lam. (Poales: Poaceae)), a non-native meadow grass known to
   facilitate S. rubrovittatus, was analyzed. Statistical analyses of data
   on bug density, vegetation, and the spatial distribution of fallow
   fields and meadows dominated by Italian ryegrass, obtained by field
   surveys, demonstrated that local and landscape-level abundances of
   Italian ryegrass (the unmowed meadow areas within a few hundred meters
   of a sampling plot) positively affected bug density before its
   immigration into rice fields. Our findings suggest that a generalist
   herbivorous insect that prefers non-native plants responds to spatial
   availability and connectivity of plant species patches at the
   metapopulation level. Fragmentation by selective mowing that decreases
   the total area of source populations and increases the isolation among
   them would be an effective and environmentally-friendly pest management
   method.}},

Title = {{Are There Consistent Grazing Indicators in Drylands? Testing Plant
   Functional Types of Various Complexity in South Africa's Grassland and
   Savanna Biomes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{AUG 11}},
Abstract = {{Despite our growing knowledge on plants' functional responses to
   grazing, there is no consensus if an optimum level of functional
   aggregation exists for detecting grazing effects in drylands. With a
   comparative approach we searched for plant functional types (PFTs) with
   a consistent response to grazing across two areas differing in climatic
   aridity, situated in South Africa's grassland and savanna biomes. We
   aggregated herbaceous species into PFTs, using hierarchical combinations
   of traits (from single-to three-trait PFTs). Traits relate to life
   history, growth form and leaf width. We first confirmed that soil and
   grazing gradients were largely independent from each other, and then
   searched in each biome for PFTs with a sensitive response to grazing,
   avoiding confounding with soil conditions. We found no response
   consistency, but biome-specific optimum aggregation levels. Three-trait
   PFTs (e.g. broad-leaved perennial grasses) and two-trait PFTs (e. g.
   perennial grasses) performed best as indicators of grazing effects in
   the semi-arid grassland and in the arid savanna biome, respectively.
   Some PFTs increased with grazing pressure in the grassland, but
   decreased in the savanna. We applied biome-specific grazing indicators
   to evaluate if differences in grazing management related to land tenure
   (communal versus freehold) had effects on vegetation. Tenure effects
   were small, which we mainly attributed to large variability in grazing
   pressure across farms. We conclude that the striking lack of
   generalizable PFT responses to grazing is due to a convergence of
   aridity and grazing effects, and unlikely to be overcome by more refined
   classification approaches. Hence, PFTs with an opposite response to
   grazing in the two biomes rather have a unimodal response along a
   gradient of additive forces of aridity and grazing. The study advocates
   for hierarchical trait combinations to identify localized indicator sets
   for grazing effects. Its methodological approach may also be useful for
   identifying ecological indicators in other ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Grazing intensity affects insect diversity via sward structure and

Abstract = {{1. In the past, insect diversity in grasslands showed a severe decline
   due to management intensification or abandonment. In this study, we
   investigate the long-term influence of grazing and the potential for
   spatial patterns created by different grazing intensities to enhance
   insect diversity.
   2. In a long-term experiment (2002-2011), three grazing intensities were
   applied to 1-ha paddocks in a triplicate block design: moderate grazing
   (MC), lenient grazing (LC) and very lenient grazing (VLC, since 2005).
   The experiment was conducted in a moderately species-rich grassland at
   the edge of the Solling Uplands in Lower Saxony, Germany. Orthoptera
   (grasshoppers) and Lepidoptera (butterflies) on three 50-m transects per
   paddock were counted in 2002-2004 and again in 2010 and 2011. Statistics
   were performed using linear mixed modelling.
   3. Grasshopper diversity measures (species richness and abundance) were
   significantly affected by grazing intensity; abundance increased from
   2002 to 2011 more strongly in the LC than in the MC treatment. Butterfly
   species richness response to grazing intensity varied among years. Data
   from 2010 and 2011 did not reveal any advantage of the lowest grazing
   intensity (VLC) compared to the intermediate grazing intensity treatment
   (LC) in either insect group.
   4. Multiple regressions were used to investigate diversity patterns.
   Along with compressed sward height, spatial patchiness was important for
   grasshopper species richness and abundance as well as for butterfly
   species numbers. Butterfly abundance was mainly influenced by vertical
   sward height heterogeneity in addition to the significant effects of
   thistle abundance and number of nectar plant species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Cattle grazing intensity affects the
   proportions and spatial heterogeneity of short and tall sward patches on
   pastures. The less mobile grasshoppers particularly benefitted from the
   structural modifications created by cattle at lenient grazing levels
   (stocking rate 1.14 SLU ha(-1), standard livestock unit (SLU) = 500 kg).
   In the final study years, areas with intermediate grazing intensity
   revealed high diversity indices and the most distinct patchiness,
   therefore a further reduction in grazing intensity is not recommended.
   This indicates that commercial livestock production may be compatible
   with conservation targets.}},

Title = {{Using filter-based community assembly models to improve restoration
   outcomes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{997-1005}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Ecological filter models derived from community assembly theory can
   inform restoration planning by highlighting management actions most
   likely to affect community composition. Despite growing interest in
   these models, many restoration studies solely manipulate a single
   assembly filter - the biotic filter by altering interspecific
   competition - while ignoring abiotic and dispersal filters that may also
   influence restoration success.
   2. To examine how manipulating all three assembly filters (biotic,
   abiotic, dispersal) affected restoration in an annual-type grassland, we
   seeded native forbs from the same functional group as a target invader
   to increase biotic resistance to invasion (biotic filter), cut standing
   biomass and either removed it or returned it to plots as litter to alter
   light conditions (abiotic filter), and added native forbs at different
   seeding rates to alter density of establishing native populations
   (dispersal filter). We measured grassland restoration success by
   recording native species and invader cover in plots.
   3. The addition of native species with phenological and morphological
   traits similar to the target invader reduced invasion and increased
   native populations, but only in litter-free plots when high densities of
   native seed were added.
   4. Seeding two species with functional traits similar to the invader was
   more effective for achieving restoration goals than seeding just one
   functionally similar species. As such, trait differences among
   restoration species, even species belonging to the same functional
   group, may increase biotic resistance to invasion in restored
   communities.
   5. Litter removal altered native-invader interactions. When litter was
   left on the plots, added natives did not reduce invader cover. However,
   when litter was removed, added natives led to declines in invader cover.
   6. Increasing native seeding rates led to larger native populations and
   increased invasion resistance.
   7. Synthesis and applications. In this study, simultaneously
   manipulating biotic, abiotic and dispersal filters was necessary to
   optimize grassland restoration outcomes. In particular, the biotic
   filter only contributed to successful restoration outcomes under abiotic
   and dispersal conditions that were created through management actions
   specifically targeting these two additional filters. Restoration
   planning based on filter models should incorporate actions that target
   all three assembly filters, rather than solely focusing on the biotic
   filter.}},

Abstract = {{Wood-pastures are fragile ecosystems because they were formed by, and
   depend on specific, low-intensity multifunctional management. Although
   their ecological and cultural significance is high, wood-pastures are
   rapidly deteriorating all over Europe, mainly due to changing land use.
   We still lack a basic understanding of the ecological value of
   wood-pastures, and in which features they differ from other landscape
   elements. In this paper we investigated the ecological value of
   wood-pastures for passerine birds by (i) comparing bird assemblages of
   wood-pastures with those of closed forests and open pastures and (ii)
   exploring the relationships between variables describing wood-pastures
   and species traits of the bird assemblages. Our study region (Southern
   Transylvania, Romania) provides a unique opportunity to understand the
   importance of a traditional cultural and ecological environment for many
   different organisms. Wood-pastures had a higher overall number of bird
   species, and a higher spatial turnover in bird community composition
   than closed forests and open pastures. We found significant associations
   between bird species traits and habitat structural elements in
   wood-pastures such as large trees, oak- and pear trees and shrubs. Our
   findings suggest that traditional wood-pastures in Southern Transylvania
   have distinct and rich passerine bird communities. This richness is
   inextricably linked to the multifunctional, low-intensity land use
   traditionally applied in the wood-pastures that promotes high niche
   diversity. For effective conservation of the biodiversity of
   wood-pastures, a detailed understanding is needed of how different
   management regimes may influence the key structural elements of
   wood-pastures relevant for biodiversity and these should be protected.}},

Abstract = {{Plant communities differ in their species composition, and, thus, also
   in their functional trait composition, at different stages in the
   succession from arable fields to grazed grassland. We examine whether
   aerial hyperspectral (414-2501 nm) remote sensing can be used to
   discriminate between grazed vegetation belonging to different grassland
   successional stages. Vascular plant species were recorded in 104.1 m(2)
   plots on the island of Oland (Sweden) and the functional properties of
   the plant species recorded in the plots were characterized in terms of
   the ground-cover of grasses, specific leaf area and Ellenberg indicator
   values. Plots were assigned to three different grassland age-classes,
   representing 5-15, 16-50 and >50 years of grazing management. Partial
   least squares discriminant analysis models were used to compare
   classifications based on aerial hyperspectral data with the age-class
   classification. The remote sensing data successfully classified the
   plots into age-classes: the overall classification accuracy was higher
   for a model based on a pre-selected set of wavebands (85\%, Kappa
   statistic value = 0.77) than one using the full set of wavebands (77\%,
   Kappa statistic value = 0.65). Our results show that nutrient
   availability and grass cover differences between grassland age-classes
   are detectable by spectral imaging. These techniques may potentially be
   used for mapping the spatial distribution of grassland habitats at
   different successional stages.}},

Journal = {{ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{1-6}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the effects of nutrient availability in cut
   grasslands on growth characteristics of Urtica dioica and its
   aboveground chemical composition (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn).
   The effects of N, P and K application on the growth of U. dioica were
   studied over five years in a Dactylis glomerata grassland cut twice per
   year under unfertilized control, P, N, NP and NPK treatments (300, 80
   and 200 kg of N, P and K ha(-1) per year).
   Nitrogen application in the form of NH4NO3 over five years decreased the
   soil pH, while P and K application increased P and K availability in the
   soil. Over five years, cover of U. dioica increased from 1\% initially
   to 7, 9, 58, 83 and 99\% in the control, P, N, NP and NPK treatments,
   respectively. Concentrations of N, P and Ca in the aboveground biomass
   of U. dioica were very high in comparison to other species and
   concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were comparable with other grassland
   species. N and P limitation of U. dioica growth was expected if
   concentrations of N and P in the aboveground biomass were lower than 25
   g N kg(-1) and 4 g P kg(-1) in the phenological stage of flowering.
   We concluded that two cuts per year are not sufficient to suppress
   expansion of U. dioica under high N, P and K availability. This probably
   explains why U. dioica survive also in frequently cut intensive
   grasslands under adequately high nutrient supply. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purse-web spiders Atypus spp. (Araneae: Atypidae) are the only
   representatives of the archaic spider infraorder Mygalomorphae in the
   Central European fauna. These burrow-dwelling spiders are red-listed in
   all Central European countries. Atypus muralis occurs on relics of
   continental steppes, Atypus piceus on dry submediterranean grassland and
   dry herb-rich forest fringes, while Atypus affinis inhabits sparse dwarf
   dry forests, usually those dominated by oaks. Long-term sustainability
   of their habitats in the relatively humid Central European climate was
   maintained by grazing. Since the 1950s, pasturing was terminated across
   most of Central Europe, which led to immediate overgrowth of pastures by
   aggressive grasses and woody plants. Grazing was later reinstated in
   some reserves, but in cases of poorly controlled grazing intensity,
   footsteps had immediate detrimental effects on the residual populations
   of purse-web spiders and other invertebrates. Therefore, grazing
   intensity needs to be regulated, considering its double-edge effects on
   the biota of xerothermophilic habitats. Nests of European Atypus species
   have never been found in habitats subject to recent or even regular
   distribution. Therefore, they may serve as reliable indicators of well
   preserved xerothermic habitats. Their nests are easy to detect, and the
   European Atypus spiders can be utilized as model species for monitoring
   impacts of conservation management. Monitoring population dynamics of
   Atypus requires establishing permanent study plots of uniform size,
   documentation of vegetation by phytocenological relev,, counting their
   density (number of purse-webs found in the plot) and age structure
   (diameter of purse webs).}},

Abstract = {{Intensification of Brazilian cattle ranching systems has attracted both
   national and international attention due to its direct relation with
   Amazon deforestation on the one hand and increasing demand of the global
   population for meat on the other. Since Brazilian cattle ranching is
   predominantly pasture-based, we particularly focus on pasture
   management. We summarize the most recurrent opportunities and risks
   associated with pasture intensification that are brought up within
   scientific and political dialogues, and discuss them within the
   Brazilian context. We argue that sustainable intensification of
   pasturelands in Brazil is a viable way to increase agricultural output
   while simultaneously sparing land for nature. Since environmental
   degradation is often associated with low-yield extensive systems in
   Brazil, it is possible to obtain higher yields, while reversing
   degradation, by adopting practices like rotational grazing,
   incorporation of legumes and integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems.
   Technical assistance is however essential, particularly for small-and
   medium-scale farmers. Sound complementary policies and good governance
   must accompany these measures so that a `rebound effect' does not lead
   to increased deforestation and other adverse social and environmental
   impacts. It is also important that animal welfare is not compromised.
   Although the discussion is presented with respect to Brazil, some
   aspects are relevant to other developing countries.}},

Abstract = {{In experimental grasslands, a positive relationship between biomass
   production and plant diversity has often been found. Here, we compared a
   moderately species-rich old sward with its grass-dominated counterpart
   (12 vs. 8 species per 2.5 m(2), or 8.3 vs. 0.7\% yield proportion of
   dicots at the start of the experiment) established by herbicide
   application. We hypothesized an increased N, P and K uptake in the
   diverse sward related to a higher colonization rate with arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), the presence of legumes, and complementary
   nutrient use of plant species. Phosphorus or N fertilizer application
   (according to contributions of AMF or legumes) were expected to balance
   the assumed smaller biomass production of the grass compared to the
   diverse sward. In two experimental years, N, P and K uptake, biomass
   production, N-2 fixation, and intra-and extraradical AMF colonization
   were investigated in an untreated control and plots that were fertilized
   with P and N in a low (P1: 20 kg P ha(-1); N1: 50 kg N ha(-1)) or a high
   dose (P2: 100 kg P ha(-1); N2: 500 kg N ha(-1)) in both swards. Biomass
   production was larger in the grass compared to the diverse sward. The N,
   P and K uptake, accumulated over three harvests (or 1.5 years), was also
   larger in the grass sward. The biomass production ranged from 5.3 to
   10.0 t ha(-1) and accumulated nutrient uptake from 82 to191 kg N ha(-1),
   19 to 31 kg P ha(-1) and 112 to 221 kg K ha(-1). Small legume
   proportions resulted in an accumulated N-2 fixation between 0 and 3 kg
   ha(-1). In the second year, the root length colonized with AMF
   structures was larger in the diverse compared to the grass sward, and
   the root length colonized with arbuscules and coils was larger in the N2
   treatment compared to the control in the diverse sward. There were hints
   to higher AMF abundance under conditions of limited P availability (low
   soil P content, high N: P ratio in plant biomass). We conclude that in
   semi-natural grassland of moderate species richness several factors may
   affect the relationship between plant diversity and productivity, i.e.,
   management, plant species identity, and the number of the plant species
   of the low-diversity level.}},

Abstract = {{Latin American subtropical dry ecosystems have experienced significant
   human impact for more than a century, mainly in the form of extensive
   livestock grazing, forest products extraction, and agriculture
   expansion. We assessed the regional-scale effect of land use and land
   cover (LULC) on patterns of richness distribution of trees, birds,
   amphibians, and mammals in the Northern Argentine Dry Chaco (NADC) over
   c. 19 million hectares. Using species distribution models in a
   hierarchical framework, we modeled the distributions of 138 species.
   First, we trained the models for the entire Argentinean Chaco with
   climatic and topographic variables. Second, we modeled the same species
   for the NADC including the biophysical variables identified as relevant
   in the first step plus four LULC-related variables: woody biomass,
   distance to crops, density of livestock-based rural settlements
   (puestos), and vegetation cover. Third, we constructed species richness
   maps by adding the models of individual species and considering two
   situations, with and without LULC variables. Four, richness maps were
   used for assessing differences when LULC variables are added and for
   determining the main drivers of current patterns of species richness. We
   found a marked decrease in species richness of the four groups as a
   consequence of inclusion of LULC variables in distribution models. The
   main factors associated with current richness distribution patterns
   (both negatively) were woody biomass and density of livestock puestos.
   Species richness in present-day Semiarid Chaco landscapes is strongly
   affected by LULC patterns, even in areas not transformed to agriculture.
   Regional-scale biodiversity planning should consider open habitats such
   as grasslands and savannas in addition to woodlands.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous studies have focused on vegetation traits and soil properties
   in grassland, few of which concerned about effects of human utilization
   patterns on grassland yet. Thus, this study hypothesized that human
   disturbance (e.g., grazing, mowing and fencing) triggered significant
   variation of biomass partitioning and carbon reallocation. Besides,
   there existed some differences of species diversity and soil fertility.
   To address these hypotheses of grassland with diverse utilization
   patterns in Hulun Buir City, Inner Mongolia, China, we sampled in situ
   about aboveground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) to
   evaluate their biomass allocation. Species diversity and soil properties
   were also investigated. Subsequently, we discussed the relationship of
   species diversity with environmental conditions, using data collected
   from 23 sites during the ecological project period of Returning Grazing
   Lands to Grasslands (RGLG) program. The results were as follows: 1) both
   AGB and BGB were lower on grazing regime than those on fencing and
   mowing, but the ratio of root-to-shoot (R/S) was higher on grazing
   regime than the other two utilization patterns; 2) neither of evenness
   and Simpson Index was different significantly among all grassland
   utilization patterns in desert, typical, and meadow grassland at 0.05.
   In meadow grassland, species richness of fencing pattern was
   significantly higher than that of grazing pattern (p < 0.05); 3) both of
   soil organic carbon content and soil available phosphorous content were
   increased significantly on fencing pattern than grazing pattern (p <
   0.05) in desert grassland, and mowing patterns increased the soil
   nutrients (soil organic carbon, soil total phosphorous, soil available
   phosphorous, and soil total nitrogen) significantly compared with
   grazing patterns (p < 0.05) in typical grassland. However, there were no
   significant differences among utilization patterns in meadow grassland.
   In conclusion, both of AGB and BGB were increased significantly by
   fencing. Moreover, species diversity and soil nutrients can be promoted
   via mowing and fencing. This study suggested that implementation of
   Ecological Project played a positive role in sustainable grassland
   utilization of Hulun Buir City and a strong positive influence on the
   entire temperate grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing exclusion is widely adopted in restoring degraded alpine
   grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. However, its effectiveness
   remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the effects of
   grazing exclusion on plant productivity, species diversity and soil
   organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) storage along a
   transect spanning from east to west of alpine meadows in northern Tibet,
   China. After six years of grazing exclusion, plant cover, aboveground
   biomass (AGB), belowground biomass (BGB), SOC and STN were increased,
   but species diversity indices declined. The enhancement of AGB and SOC
   caused by grazing exclusion was correlated positively with mean annual
   precipitation (MAP). Grazing exclusion led to remarkable biomass
   increase of sedge species, especially Kobresia pygmaea, whereas decrease
   of biomass in forbs and no obvious change in grass, leguminous and
   noxious species. Root biomass was concentrated in the near surface layer
   (10 cm) after grazing exclusion. The effects of grazing exclusion on SOC
   storage were confined to shallow soil layer in sites with lower MAP. It
   is indicated that grazing exclusion is an effective measure to increase
   forage production and enhance soil carbon sequestration in the studied
   region. The effect is more efficient in sites with higher precipitation.
   However, the results revealed a tradeoff between vegetation restoration
   and ecological biodiversity. Therefore, carbon pools recover more
   quickly than plant biodiversity in the alpine meadows. We suggest that
   grazing exclusion should be combined with other measures to reconcile
   grassland restoration and biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Due to agricultural intensification and cessation of traditional land
   use, alkaline fens of the Caricion davallianae alliance (EU-FFH 7230)
   are among the most endangered ecosystems in Europe. This study exhibits
   a vegetation analysis of these systems in Schleswig-Holstein (Northern
   Germany). We analyzed across three scales the effects of grazing and
   mowing on phytodiversity of core areas and recorded their adjacent
   vegetation to estimate the capability for habitat enlargement of fen
   species. Results revealed that species richness, evenness and number of
   endangered species varied insignificantly between mowing and grazing
   treatments, regardless of scale. The high proportion of fen species and
   Red-Book-listed species in core areas, along with a state-wide
   representation of only 2 ha of these vegetation types, underlines the
   need for further conservation measures. Floristic differences between
   grazed and mowed sites derived from the individual appearance of species
   within one treatment. Thus, to preserve the species pool of alkaline
   fens, both management strategies have to be considered. Moreover, as
   most small sedge reed species are low-productive and light-demanding,
   sufficient biomass removal of dominant tall-growing species is required.
   One cut per year in late summer, the traditional management, does not
   satisfy the requirements of target species, which is indicated by an
   increase of Phragmitetea species at larger plot sizes. Additionally, in
   grazed fens, vegetation adjacent to the core areas consisted mainly of
   more eutrophic wet grasslands, and, in mowed fens, mainly of reeds or
   woods. We recommend therefore several changes in current conservation
   measures that include an increase to two cuts per year in mowed fens,
   and stocking rates of at least 2 LU ha(-1) (summer grazing) or 0.7 LU
   ha(-1) (year-round grazing). (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Title = {{Effects of altered precipitation on insect community composition and

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Precipitation can be a key driver of ecosystem functioning in
   semi-arid and arid grasslands. Altered precipitation patterns had
   significant impacts on plant community dynamics, which in turn
   influenced the community composition and structure of higher trophic
   levels, especially insects, in grasslands.
   2. A field experiment was conducted by manipulating the amount of
   natural precipitation (control, +30\% rainfall, and 30\% rainfall) to
   examine the effects of altered precipitation patterns on insect
   diversity, abundance, and imp-hie structure in a meadow steppe over 3
   years (2007-2009),
   3. The, results showed that the increased precipitation treatment
   significantly enhanced above-ground biomass of the entire plant
   community and particularly grasses, whereas the decreased precipitation
   treatment significantly reduced them. There were year-to-year changes in
   species richness, Shannon Wiener index, and abundance of the whole
   insect community. Both increased and decreased precipitation caused
   declines in insect species richness and abundance owing to potentially
   complex vegetation-mediated effects and direct habitat effects. The
   abundance of each trophic guild in the insect community responded
   differently to altered precipitation patterns, with lower herbivore
   abundance and unchanged abundance of predators and parasitoids, Thus
   changes in precipitation may generate an insect community that is
   increasingly dominated by secondary consumers.
   4. The present results suggest that altered precipitation causes a
   declines in insect diversity and shifts in trophic structure,
   potentially influencing ecosystem functioning in grasslands.
   Additionally, the inter-annual variation in the insect community under
   altered precipitation highlights the importance of long-term experiments
   for drawing correct conclusions about the impacts of climate change on
   grassland ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},

Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing demand for spatially explicit assessment of multiple
   ecosystem services (ES) and remote sensing (RS) can provide valuable
   data to meet this challenge. In this study, located in the Central
   French Alps, we used high spatial and spectral resolution RS images to
   assess multiple ES based on underpinning ecosystem properties (EP) of
   subalpine grasslands. We estimated five EP (green biomass, litter mass,
   crude protein content, species diversity and soil carbon content) from
   RS data using empirical RS methods and maps of ES were calculated as
   simple linear combinations of EP. Additionally, the RS-based results
   were compared with results of a plant trait-based statistical modelling
   approach that predicted EP and ES from land use, abiotic and plant trait
   data (modelling approach). The comparison between the RS and the
   modelling approaches showed that RS-based results provided better
   insight into the fine-grained spatial distribution of EP and thereby ES,
   whereas the modelling approach reflected the land use signal that
   underpinned trait-based models of EP. The spatial agreement between the
   two approaches at a 20-m resolution varied between 16 and 22\% for
   individual EP, but for the total ecosystem service supply it was only
   7\%. Furthermore, the modelling approach identified the alpine grazed
   meadows land use class as areas with high values of multiple ES (hot
   spots) and mown-grazed permanent meadows as areas with low values and
   only few ES (cold spots). Whereas the RS-based hot spots were a small
   subset of those predicted by the modelling approach, cold spots were
   rather scattered, small patches with limited overlap with the modelling
   results. Despite limitations associated with timing of assessment
   campaigns and field data requirements, RS offers valuable data for
   spatially continuous mapping of EP and can thus supply RS-based proxies
   of ES. Although the RS approach was applied to a limited area and for
   one type of ecosystem, we believe that the broader availability of high
   fidelity airborne and satellite RS data will promote RS-based assessment
   of ES to larger areas and other ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the evolution from the mid-nineteenth century to the present
   of the cultural landscape in two Catalan townships that jointly
   constitute an edge environment between Mediterranean plain and mountain.
   This environmental edge has changed over time, from a border between an
   agricultural plain confronting an area of forestry and livestock-raising
   in the mid-nineteenth century, to a limit of the Barcelona Metropolitan
   Region confronting two `natural' protected sites in the present. Over a
   century and a half land use changes in this area have brought about the
   two main, but superficially `opposed' dynamics that characterise
   landscape evolution throughout Catalonia and great parts of Europe
   today: intensification and abandonment. The most salient ecological
   impact of both processes has been the loss of landscape mosaics. In the
   plain those mosaics interwove cereal cropping with vineyards and olive
   orchards together with patches of woodland, scrubland and pastureland
   into an agricultural land matrix. In the mountains, a woodland matrix of
   holm oaks and pines became cleared through timber and firewood
   extraction, and the pruning of branches for charcoal making, creating a
   mixture of open forest articulated by grazing areas, cropland and scrub.
   Both sides of the edge interlinked, and jointly played a key role as
   ecological connectors to maintain biodiversity. From the 1960s onwards
   the ecological dynamics attendant upon the abandonment of the prevailing
   integrated management of forests, livestock breeding and cropland has
   led to a significant loss of these landscape mosaics. In spite of the
   transformation of much of this area into natural protected sites, the
   growth of a uniform and continuous reforested woodland canopy, directly
   confronted with urban sprawl, is endangering its richness in terms of
   species such as Mediterranean orchids, whose habitats are disappearing.}},

Abstract = {{Use of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is often recommended to
   relieve knowledge deficit in conservation. However, studies on
   traditional knowledge of threatened species are scarce, especially in
   Europe. Twenty-three interviews about 20 threatened plant species (name,
   habitat, flowering time, human use, population trends, causes of decline
   or growth) were conducted in each of the two contrasting landscapes,
   traditional in Romania (Gyimes), abandoned in Hungary (Zala). Amount of
   knowledge relevant to conservation was less than expected. Habitat and
   flowering time was known the best, and causes of population decline and
   growth the least. Better known plants had richer TEK on their dynamics
   (65\% of species in Gyimes, and 35\% in Zala). We documented many cases
   of positive and negative effects of manuring, fertilization,
   eradication, grazing, mowing, picking, drought, succession, and
   abandonment. Most knowledge originated from personal experience, and
   shared knowledge seemed to be limited. Knowledge deficiency may be
   explained by the stability of the landscape, and the ignorance of many
   threatened species by locals in Gyimes (lack of knowledge), and by the
   abandonment of traditional land use and ignorance in Zala (loss of
   knowledge). We argue that substantial TEK on threatened species maybe
   expected for those species that have been utilized as a resource or have
   hindered the utilization of a resource. We argue that TEK can provide
   relevant information to conservation less at the population, and more at
   the habitat and landscape level. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier GmbH.}},

   to disentangle the effects of individual drivers and quantify the time
   required for a biodiversity response are seldom available. Management
   decisions are often based on short-term experiments or observational
   data.
   2. A 15-year field experiment, comprising a factorial combination of
   fertilization, mowing and removal of the dominant species Molinia
   caerulea, was established in an oligotrophic wet meadow in Czech
   Republic. Each of the eight factorial combinations was replicated three
   times. Percentage cover for all species was monitored annually in 1-m(2)
   plots and species' presence recorded in each cell of a continuous square
   grid of 25 cells (0.1 x 0.1 m each). These data enabled various
   scale-dependent estimates of species richness.
   3. The species composition of individual treatment combinations diverged
   over time, particularly at the start of the experiment, and by the
   latter stages resembled various typical grassland communities from the
   surrounding landscape. Fertilization had the most pronounced effect,
   leading to a sharp decrease in species richness, most rapidly at the
   smallest spatial scale. Mowing had on average a positive effect on
   species richness and led in most cases to spatially homogeneous species
   composition. The removal of Molinia had a positive effect on species
   richness, especially in unmown unfertilized plots.
   4. The effects of each factor were dependent on the combination of the
   other two factors, and also on time, with some effects continuously
   increasing throughout and some diminishing by the end of the experiment.
   The process of competitive exclusion with fertilization and cessation of
   mowing was, in some treatment combinations, rather slow.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Land-use change drivers act in
   combination, and their effects on the structure of species-rich wet
   meadows are dependent on both the temporal and spatial scales
   considered. Short-term experiments might underestimate the response of
   vegetation and thus provide erroneous conservation recommendations.
   Mowing was only effective in preventing species richness decline caused
   by fertilization in the short term. The presence of a single dominant
   species can modify the effectiveness of conservation measures.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{67-76}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Vegetated buffer strips alongside watercourses are commonly used to
   counteract diffuse pollution from agricultural activities. If properly
   designed, they can provide multiple environmental benefits by increasing
   wildlife habitats and biodiversity. Little attention has been paid to
   the effects of buffer strips on soil quality. This study was conducted
   to determine the impact of different buffer designs on soil biochemical
   parameters and to define relevant quality parameters for soil
   monitoring. We compared four buffer arrangements: 3m wide grass buffer;
   3m grass with one tree row; 6 m grass with one tree row; 6 m grass with
   two tree rows; plus two controls: an adjacent maize crop field and a
   plot without buffer. Buffers were established 13 years ago at the Padua
   University Experimental Farm in the Po Valley, north-east Italy. Studied
   parameters included soil organic matter composition and soil microbial
   and enzymatic assays. As expected, control plots showed the lowest
   values for all the studied parameters. Among buffer designs, 3m grass
   and 3m grass with 1 tree row buffers gave the highest values.
   Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the increase of soil organic
   carbon content distinguished buffers from controls, whereas soil humic
   carbon quality parameters such as humic compounds apparent molecular
   weight, together with acetyl esterase (fluorescein test) enzyme
   activity, were discriminatory in separating buffer designs. These
   results are an important contribution to the knowledge base and can help
   to improve the management of these systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Ecological Consequences of Shifting the Timing of Burning Tallgrass
   Prairie}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{In the Kansas Flint Hills, grassland burning is conducted during a
   relatively narrow window because management recommendations for the past
   40 years have been to burn only in late spring. Widespread prescribed
   burning within this restricted time frame frequently creates smoke
   management issues downwind. A potential remedy for the concentrated
   smoke production in late spring is to expand burning to times earlier in
   the year. Yet, previous research suggested that burning in winter or
   early spring reduces plant productivity and cattle weight gain while
   increasing the proportion of undesirable plant species. In order to
   better understand the ecological consequences of burning at different
   times of the year, plant production and species abundance were measured
   for 20 years on ungrazed watersheds burned annually in autumn, winter,
   or spring. We found that there were no significant differences in total
   grass production among the burns on either upland or lowland topographic
   positions, although spring burned watersheds had higher grass culm
   production and lower forb biomass than autumn and winter burned
   watersheds. Burning in autumn or winter broadened the window of grass
   productivity response to precipitation, which reduces susceptibility to
   mid-season drought. Burning in autumn or winter also increased the
   phenological range of species by promoting cool-season graminoids
   without a concomitant decrease in warm-season grasses, potentially
   widening the seasonal window of high-quality forage. Incorporating
   autumn and winter burns into the overall portfolio of tallgrass prairie
   management should increase the flexibility in managing grasslands,
   promote biodiversity, and minimize air quality issues caused by en masse
   late-spring burning with little negative consequences for cattle
   production.}},

Title = {{Seed Rain and Seed Bank Reveal that Seed Limitation Strongly Influences
   Plant Community Assembly in Grasslands}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{Dispersal is an important factor in plant community assembly, but
   assembly studies seldom include information on actual dispersal into
   communities, i.e. the local propagule pool. The aim of this study was to
   determine which factors influence plant community assembly by focusing
   on two phases of the assembly process: the dispersal phase and the
   establishment phase. At 12 study sites in grazed ex-arable fields in
   Sweden the local plant community was determined and in a 100-m radius
   around the centre of each site, the regional species pool was measured.
   The local seed bank and the seed rain was explored to estimate the local
   propagule pool. Trait-based models were then applied to investigate if
   species traits (height, seed mass, clonal abilities, specific leaf area
   and dispersal method) and regional abundance influenced which species
   from the regional species pool, dispersed to the local community
   (dispersal phase) and which established (establishment phase). Filtering
   of species during the dispersal phase indicates the effect of seed
   limitation while filtering during the establishment phase indicates
   microsite limitation. On average 36\% of the regional species pool
   dispersed to the local sites and of those 78\% did establish. Species
   with enhanced dispersal abilities, e.g. higher regional abundance,
   smaller seeds and dispersed by cattle, were more likely to disperse to
   the sites than other species. At half the sites, dispersal was
   influenced by species height. Species establishment was however mainly
   unlinked to the traits included in this study. This study underlines the
   importance of seed limitation in local plant community assembly. It also
   suggests that without information on species dispersal into a site, it
   is difficult to distinguish between the influence of dispersal and
   establishment abilities, and thus seed and microsite limitation, as both
   can be linked to the same trait.}},

Title = {{Socio-Cultural and Economic Valuation of Ecosystem Services Provided by
   Mediterranean Mountain Agroecosystems}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 18}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this work was to elucidate the socio-cultural and economic
   value of a number of ecosystem services delivered by mountain
   agroecosystems (mostly grazing systems) in Euro-Mediterranean regions.
   We combined deliberative (focus groups) and survey-based
   stated-preference methods (choice modelling) to, first, identify the
   perceptions of farmers and other citizens on the most important
   ecosystem services and, second, to value these in economic terms
   according to the willingness to pay of the local (residents of the study
   area) and general (region where the study area is located) populations.
   Cultural services (particularly the aesthetic and recreational values of
   the landscape), supporting services (biodiversity maintenance) and some
   regulating services (particularly fire risk prevention) were clearly
   recognized by both farmers and citizens, with different degrees of
   importance according to their particular interests and objectives. The
   prevention of forest fires (approximate to 50\% of total willingness to
   pay) was valued by the general population as a key ecosystem service
   delivered by these agroecosystems, followed by the production of
   specific quality products linked to the territory (approximate to 20\%),
   biodiversity (approximate to 20\%) and cultural landscapes (approximate
   to 10\%). The value given by local residents to the last two ecosystem
   services differed considerably (approximate to 10 and 25\% for
   biodiversity and cultural landscape, respectively). The Total Economic
   Value of mountain agroecosystems was approximate to 120 (sic) person(-1)
   year(-1), three times the current level of support of agro-environmental
   policies. By targeting and quantifying the environmental objectives of
   the European agri-environmental policy and compensating farmers for the
   public goods they deliver, the so-called ``green'' subsidies may become
   true Payments for Ecosystems Services.}},

Title = {{Factors influencing natural regeneration of totara (Podocarpus totara
   D.Don) on grazed hill country grassland in Northland, New Zealand}},
Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF FORESTRY SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{44}},
Month = {{JUL 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: There is increasing interest in establishing indigenous
   forests on marginal pastoral hill country in New Zealand to improve soil
   conservation, water quality and indigenous biodiversity. Large-scale
   reforestation using native seedlings is extremely costly. However, given
   suitable seed sources, it is possible to encourage natural regeneration
   of grassland into native plants.
   Methods: A grazed, sloping pasture site in Northland where totara
   (Podocarpus totara D.Don) regeneration had been allowed to develop over
   a 10-year period was assessed using a grid of 2-metre diameter plots.
   Counts of regenerating woody species and cover of herbaceous species
   were obtained in each plot. Plots were classified on the basis of
   herbaceous species cover using the TWINSPAN classification procedure.
   Regression analyses were used to identify site factors and
   characteristics of the herbaceous vegetation associated with totara
   regeneration.
   Results: More than 7,000 stems ha(-1) of woody species, mostly totara
   and gorse (Ulex europaeus L.), had accumulated over the 10-year period
   despite the presence of cattle grazing. Regeneration of totara was
   associated with steeper slopes and sites with the greatest diversity of
   herbaceous species but with lower overall levels of herbaceous cover.
   The regeneration pattern of the other main woody species was similar
   although gorse colonised a wider range of sites. Regeneration of woody
   species was absent on flatter sites, which were dominated by a few
   high-fertility tolerant herbaceous species and had high levels of
   herbaceous cover.
   Conclusion: This study has shown that regeneration of totara on a
   pastoral hill-country site was most prevalent on steeper slopes of lower
   fertility with typically sparse vegetation cover comprising low
   fertility tolerant herbaceous species. Conversely, totara regeneration
   was absent on flatter areas of higher fertility. It seems likely that
   grazing assists totara regeneration by keeping pasture cover short, thus
   increasing light levels near ground level for newly germinated
   seedlings. The propensity for totara to regenerate on pastoral hill
   country in the presence of grazing and where there is a nearby seed
   source could provide a practical option for re-establishing indigenous
   woody vegetation on erosion-prone marginal land.}},

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how different herbivores make forage patch use choices
   explains how they maintain an adequate nutritional status, which is
   important for effective conservation management of grazing ecosystems.
   Using telemetry data, we investigated nonruminant zebra (Equus
   burchelli) and ruminant red hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus subspecies
   camaa), use of burnt patches in a landscape mosaic of nutrient-poor, old
   grassland interspersed with young, recently burnt, nutrient-rich grass
   patches. The Mkambati Nature Reserve landscape on the east coast of
   South Africa provided large grazers with a challenge in finding and
   using appropriate patches in which to forage to meet their nutritional
   requirements. In Mkambati, grassland fires, mostly ignited by poachers,
   induce regrowth of young nutrient-rich grass, which subsequently attract
   grazers. We tested if the study animals foraged more in burnt patches
   than in the unburned grassland and whether burnt patch use was related
   to the distance to the previously visited burnt patch, burnt patch size,
   burnt patch age, and distance to areas with high poaching risk using
   MANOVA. In general, zebra moved faster than red hartebeest, and both
   species moved faster in unburnt grassland than in burnt patches. Red
   hartebeest and zebra patch selection were influenced by interpatch
   distance, patch age, patch size, and poaching risk. A limited set of
   intrinsic traits, i.e., body mass, digestion strategy, and muzzle width,
   yielded different patch use rules for the two species. Large ungulates
   patch use behaviour varied among species and across conditions and was
   influenced by anthropogenic impacts such as poaching and changed fire
   regimes. This could potentially affect biodiversity negatively and needs
   to be factored into management of conservation areas.}},

Title = {{Can Organic Amendments Be Useful in Transforming a Mediterranean

Abstract = {{Transforming a shrubland into a dehesa system may be useful for
   recovering certain productive and regulatory functions of ecosystems
   such as grazing potential, soil erosion control, and also for reducing
   the risk of wildfire. However, the productivity of the herbaceous cover
   and tree development in the transformed system may be limited by soil
   fertility, especially after wildfire events. Previous studies have shown
   that adequate doses of sewage sludge may improve soil fertility and
   facilitate plant recovery, but few studies have focused on plant
   biodiversity assessment. Here, we compare the effects of sewage sludge
   that has undergone different post-treatments (dewatering, composting, or
   thermal drying) as a soil amendment used to transform a fire-affected
   shrubland into a dehesa, on tree growth and pasture composition
   (vegetation cover, species richness, and diversity). In the short term,
   sewage sludge causes changes in both pasture cover and tree growth.
   Although no major differences in vegetation species richness and
   composition have been detected, fertilization using sewage sludge was
   shown to modify the functional diversity of the vegetation community.
   Rapid replacement of shrubs by herbaceous cover and ruderal plants (e.g.
   Bromus hordeaceus and Leontodon taraxacoides) and of the three grass
   species sown (Festuca arundinacea, Lolium perenne, and Dactylis
   glomerata) was observed, whereas N-fixing species (leguminous) tended to
   be more abundant in nonfertilized soils and soils amended with composted
   sludge. These results indicate that sewage sludge modifies the
   functionality of vegetation when applied to soils, and that the response
   varies according to the treatment that the sludge has undergone.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how plant species richness influences the diversity of
   herbivorous and predatory/parasitic arthropods is central to community
   ecology. We explore the effects of crop species richness on the
   diversity of pest insects and their natural enemies. Using data from a
   four-year experiment with five levels of crop species richness, we found
   that crop species richness significantly affected the pest species
   richness, but there were no significant effects on richness of the
   pests' natural enemies. In contrast, the species richness of pest
   insects significantly affected their natural enemies. These findings
   suggest a cascade effect where trophic interactions are strong between
   adjacent trophic levels, while the interactions between connected but
   nonadjacent trophic levels are weakened by the intermediate trophic
   level. High crop species richness resulted in a more stable arthropod
   community compared with communities in monoculture crops. Our results
   highlight the complicated cross-trophic interactions and the crucial
   role of crop diversity in the food webs of agro-ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Brown hares and rabbits are widely distributed in agricultural
   landscapes across the UK, occupy similar habitats and have considerable
   dietary overlap. However, as agriculture in the UK has intensified,
   hares have declined and become a species of conservation concern while
   rabbits have become an increasing pest. An intensive study of hares,
   rabbits and the dynamics of pastures over two grazing seasons was
   undertaken, in order to understand the environmental factors associated
   with hare and rabbit abundance at field level. Linear mixed models were
   used to assess the environmental variables, in terms of the structure,
   nutritional components and effects of livestock grazing that are
   associated with the abundance of the two species. The models revealed
   that hares were negatively associated with grazing intensity and plant
   diversity, whereas rabbits showed the strongest associations with
   nutritional content of pastures, in particular fat, nitrogen and fibre
   content in forage, as well as a positive association with short grass
   swards. The data suggest that, at the field-scale intensification of
   pasture use may have contributed to declines in hares and increases in
   rabbits. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{82-93}},

Abstract = {{Compositional indicators (i.e. indices that focus on the identity of
   species, genes or phylogeny) have been widely used to estimate and
   monitor biodiversity, however, their use in combination with species
   and/or community functional characteristics remains limited. Using
   large-scale, spatio-temporal data, we use both compositional and
   functional indices to investigate land-use change impacts on the
   vegetation of a semi-natural grassland ecosystem (Machair) for fourteen
   regions in Scotland, UK. Our study aimed to identify national- and
   regional-scale temporal vegetation patterns, and through use of simple
   compositional and functional indices (e.g. Competitor, Stress, Ruderal
   and Ellenberg scores) link observed changes to agricultural
   intensification and/or land-use abandonment. Using linear-mixed
   modelling and nonmetric multi-dimensional scaling, we showed significant
   national and regional-scale changes in species composition over time.
   Increases in diversity, particularly gains in Machair grassland,
   identified several regions that may have benefited from past government
   incentivised schemes to protect the Machair, but which may also be
   suffering from an extinction lag. Shifts in plant functional signatures
   (CSR \& Ellenberg values) identified varying degrees of internal
   (competition) and external (land-use) factors, highlighting several
   regions where biodiversity change could be linked to reduced disturbance
   (i.e. lower grazing intensity) or greater disturbance (i.e. land-use
   intensification). Our results demonstrate the utility of simple
   compositional and functional indices for monitoring biodiversity of
   semi-natural grasslands and identifying land-use drivers of change
   across different spatial scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},

Volume = {{175}},

Abstract = {{Balancing biodiversity conservation and rural food security is a
   pressing challenge for developing countries, with tropical
   agro-grasslands facing particularly high human dependence and species'
   endangerment. We explored the potential influences of agricultural
   growth and allocation of multiple landuses on the status of two
   threatened species inhabiting semiarid agro-grasslands of India.
   Sampling 1 km(2) cells for flagship lesser florican Sypheotides indica
   and 0.03 ha plots for spiny-tailed lizard Saara hardwickii, we modeled
   species' abundances with land-cover, vegetation structure, and
   disturbances using N-mixture (florican) and poisson (lizard) models.
   Florican abundance responded unimodally to herbaceous biomass (grassland
   proportion x ground-vegetation height), wherein, numbers peaked at
   optimally large combinations of grassland proportion (0.5-1) and
   ground-vegetation height (35-65 cm). Whereas, lizard abundance was
   positively influenced by grassland occurrence and ground-vegetation < 50
   cm cover but negatively influenced by cropland occurrence. Livestock
   grazing promoted short vegetation over tall vegetation, partially
   hindering florican but facilitating lizard. Such inter-specific
   differences in landuse response invoked multi-criteria planning based on
   surrogates of ecologically distinct species-groups. Fitting our models
   to simulated landuse scenarios, we demonstrated that managing florican
   habitats as grassland interspersed with croplands and pastures spared
   rotationally provided optimal results at low production-level. However,
   projected agricultural growth would cause considerable declines of
   florican (>30\%) and lizard (>20\%) populations. To prevent this,
   remaining florican occupied agro-grasslands should be secured as
   Community/Conservation reserves so that further landuse conversions can
   be legally restricted. Simultaneously, government schemes like food
   provisioning to small farmers through public distribution system could
   be harnessed to compensate for production deficit within/adjoining
   reserves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Conservation value of silvopastures to Neotropical migrants in Andean
   forest flocks}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{175}},
Pages = {{140-147}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In the face of continued loss of Andean forests, shade agroforestry is a
   promising approach where agricultural production and conservation can
   co-occur to support environmental and socioeconomic needs. Agroforestry
   systems provide habitat for a diverse avifauna, including several
   migratory species of concern. Unfortunately, shaded crops continue to be
   converted to sun monocultures and pastures which provide fewer ecosystem
   services, reduce habitat complexity, and support less biodiversity.
   Silvopastoral systems, which combine grazing pastures and trees, have
   recently been drawing worldwide attention. In an effort to evaluate the
   conservation value of little-studied silvopastures to Andean birds, we
   compared mixed-species flock communities associated with different
   forested habitats. In January-February of 2011-2013, species
   composition, flock size, and individual foraging heights were recorded
   for 446 flocks at 9 study areas in Antioquia, Colombia. We sampled
   shade-coffee, shade-cardamom, secondary forest, and silvopasture at
   similar to 1,150-1,850 m elevation and measured vegetative structure in
   each habitat. Less structurally-complex silvopastures supported smaller,
   less diverse flocks with fewer Neotropical migrants and resident forest
   specialists. Further, fewer male Blackbumian Warblers flocked in
   silvopastures compared to other habitats, which is consistent with other
   studies showing that overwintering male migrants tend to occupy the
   highest quality habitats. Although forest birds may be better served by
   silvopastures than conventional treeless pastures, our findings suggest
   that silvopastoral systems are less suitable for flocking birds than
   other forested habitats. However, agroforestry remains an important
   complementary approach to other strategies to maintain Andean forests
   and improve the conservation potential of degraded land. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Understanding decadal-scale land-cover changes has the potential to
   inform current conservation policies. European mountain landscapes that
   include numerous protected areas provide a unique opportunity to weigh
   the long-term influences of land-use practices and climate on
   forest-grassland ecotone dynamics. Aerial photographs from four dates
   (1948, 1978, 1993, and 2009) were used to quantify the extent of forest
   and grassland cover at 5-m resolution across a 150-km(2) area in a
   protected area of the southwestern French Alps. The study area included
   a grazed zone and a nongrazed zone that was abandoned during the 1970s.
   We estimated time series of a forestation index (FI) and analyzed the
   effects of elevation and grazing on FI using a hierarchical linear mixed
   effect model. Forest extent (composed primarily of mountain pine, Pinus
   uncinata) expanded from 50.6 km(2) in 1948 to 85.5 km(2) in 2009, i.e.,
   a 23\% increase in relative cover at the expense of grassland
   communities. Over the sixty-year period, the treeline rose by 118 m,
   from 1564 to 1682 m. Rapid forest expansion within the nongrazed zone
   followed the cessation of logging activities and was likely accelerated
   by climate warming during the 1980s. Within the grazed zone, the
   maintained presence of sheep did not fully counteract mountain pine
   expansion and led to highly contrasting rates of land-cover change based
   on the location of shepherds' cabins and water sources. Projections of
   FI for 2030 showed remnant patches of intensively used grasslands
   interspersed in a densely forested matrix. Our analysis of mountain
   land-cover dynamics provided strong evidence for forest encroachment
   into grassland habitat despite consistent grazing pressure. This pattern
   may be attributed to the disappearance of traditional land-use practices
   such as shrub burning and removal. Our findings prompt land managers to
   reconsider their initial conservation priority (i.e., the protection of
   a renowned mountain pine forest) and to implement proactive management
   strategies in order to preserve landscape heterogeneity and biological
   diversity. Projecting historical trends in the forest-grassland ecotone
   to 2030 provides stakeholders with a policy relevant tool for near-term
   land management.}},

Abstract = {{1. The inherent complexity of nature produces a diverse and varied set
   of outcomes for any given ecological process. However, the advance of
   ecology requires making generalizations that synthesize current
   knowledge and guide new basic research and practical applications. Among
   the synthesis tools available for this specific purpose, meta-analysis
   is one of the most accurate and powerful methods.
   2. This Special Feature examines the use that meta-analysis has received
   in plant ecology over the last two decades and provides examples of
   synthesis applied to contemporary topics in different areas of plant
   ecology from populations to ecosystems.
   3. The number of meta-analyses in plant ecology has been increasing
   rapidly in the last two decades. However, this increase has not been
   accompanied by a parallel increase in quality. The opening review paper
   in this Special Feature provides a checklist of quality criteria
   specific to ecological meta-analysis that will largely contribute to
   improvement of the methodological and reporting standards of
   meta-analyses.
   4. The following five papers in the Special Feature demonstrate the
   advantages of application of meta-analysis compared with other
   techniques of research synthesis. Meta-analysis is applied here to
   demonstrate the consistency of ecological hypotheses across large
   spatial scales (e.g. Janzen-Connell hypothesis), understand sources of
   variation in the magnitude of ecological processes (e.g. herbivory
   effects on leaf life span, effects of intraspecific genetic diversity on
   communities and ecosystems), measure synergistic impacts of
   environmental change drivers (e.g. CO2, drought, land use) or assess
   research gaps within a certain sub-discipline of plant ecology (e.g.
   landscape fragmentation).
   5. Synthesis. Meta-analysis can contribute to the advance of ecological
   theory by synthesizing the available evidence on specific topics and
   informing the scope of generalizations. However, plant ecologists can
   only take full advantage of this capacity if we improve our knowledge on
   how and when to conduct a proper meta-analysis, and by avoiding the
   frequent misuses that have characterized the use of this statistical
   tool in the ecological literature thus far.}},

Title = {{Land management trumps the effects of climate change and elevated CO2 on
   grassland functioning}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{102}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{896-904}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Grasslands cover similar to 30\% of the Earth's terrestrial surface
   and provide many ecosystem services. Many grasslands are heavily managed
   to maximize these services for human benefit, but the outcome of
   management is anticipated to be increasingly influenced by various
   aspects of climate change and elevated atmospheric CO2. The relative
   importance of global change vs. land management on grasslands is largely
   unknown.
   2. A meta-analysis is used here to examine drivers at both scales
   primarily targeting services provided by grasslands relating to plant
   productivity (above- and below-ground biomass) and soil processes
   (nutrients and soil respiration) in 38 manipulative experiments
   published in the last decade. We specifically target effects of (i)
   single and combined land management practices (LMs), (ii) single and
   combined factors relating to broad-scale climate change and elevated
   CO2, and (iii) combined management practices and changes to climate and
   CO2. Collectively, this examines the general efficacy of global change
   models in predicting changes to grassland functioning.
   3. We found that combinations of management practices had approximately
   double the explanatory power for variation in grassland services
   compared with individual or interactive effects of factors associated
   with climate change and CO2. These interacting management practices such
   as nutrient additions and defoliation predominantly influenced functions
   associated with productivity or biomass both below and above ground. The
   effects of interacting factors of climate and CO2 influenced a wider
   range of ecosystem functions, but the magnitude of these effects was
   relatively smaller.
   4. Interactions between management practices or between climate
   change/CO2 factors always had higher explanatory power than any factor
   in isolation indicating that multivariate synergistic models of
   environmental change can better describe impacts on ecosystem function
   in plant communities (e.g. relative to univariate climate-based models).
   Given that the magnitude and direction (positive or negative) of the
   interactions varied widely, this also implies that the outcomes of these
   multivariate interactions can vary spatially, temporally or by immediate
   context (e.g. management prescriptions).
   5. Synthesis. Although our work confirms how climate change and CO2 can
   affect many ecosystem-based functional attributes, it suggests that
   combinations of LMs remain the dominant set of factors in determining
   the performance of grassland plant communities. Land management may thus
   be critical for influencing projected responses to future climate change
   and elevated CO2 in models of grassland function at least for factors
   relating to primary production.}},

Abstract = {{Rangeland birds in the Southern High Plains, USA evolved within a
   context of fire and grazing (i.e., pyric herbivory), a disturbance
   regime that played a dominant role in shaping rangelands in this region
   but has been absent since the 1880s. A management technique known as
   patch-burn grazing was used to mimic the heterogeneity in vegetation
   created by the historical disturbance regime of fire and grazing in sand
   sagebrush (Artemisia filifolia) rangelands. We compared nest survival of
   Cassin's sparrows (Peucaea cassinii), field sparrows (Spizella pusilla),
   and lark sparrows (Chondestes grammacus); species richness; and
   densities of 11 bird species between rangelands managed with patch-burn
   grazing and rangelands managed with traditional management (i.e.,
   seasonal grazing) in Oklahoma from 2006 to 2008. Estimates of nest
   survival were similar between patch-burn and traditional pastures
   (Cassin's sparrows: 51\% and 57\%; field sparrows: 18\% and 22\%; and
   lark sparrows: 14\% and 12\%, patch-burn and traditional, respectively).
   Species richness was higher in patch-burn pastures compared to
   traditionally managed pastures. Densities of the majority of avian
   species (73\%) were similar between treatments; however, lark sparrow
   densities were 5 times more abundant in patch-burn pastures and
   grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and brown-headed cowbirds
   (Molothrus ater) were >3 times more abundant on traditional pastures.
   Our results suggest that introducing patch-burn grazing management to
   sand sagebrush rangelands is not detrimental to nesting shrubland birds,
   and the creation of heterogeneity through patch-burn grazing can
   increase avian species diversity. Furthermore, some species such as lark
   sparrows may benefit from patch-burn grazing. Patch-burn management may
   be an important tool to assist in the recovery of biodiversity in this
   ecosystem. (c) 2014 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{For many years, we have seen an increasing specialization of
   agricultural systems and territories, with a clear separation between
   territories with very high animal densities and those devoted to the
   growing of annual crops. This development is explained by market and
   sector economic logic and has been reinforced by the availability of
   low-cost inputs and animal housing systems based on direct grazing not
   requiring straw. It has, however, also involved negative environmental
   impacts and, in some cases, the impoverishment of soil fertility, a loss
   of biodiversity, and excesses of N and P, leading to eutrophication and
   hot spots of ammonia emission in livestock-breeding territories. Having
   recapped the mechanisms behind the specialization of systems and
   territories, we examined the extent to which the development of
   innovative mixed-farming systems that reconnect livestock and crop
   production on various territorial scales (farm, district, region) can
   reduce the negative impacts of agriculture on the environment, produce
   valuable ecosystem services and achieve acceptable economic efficiency
   for farming enterprises. Examples from temperate regions will be used to
   show that mixed-farming systems increase the possibilities of better
   recycling of nutrients within systems, limiting recourse to the purchase
   of increasingly expensive inputs and safeguarding the biodiversity of
   agricultural ecosystems. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Field margins: a comparison of establishment methods and effects on
   hymenopteran parasitoid communities}},
Journal = {{INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{289-307}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Field margins within intensively managed ecosystems are often seen as
   a last refuge for biodiversity, and are typically targeted with measures
   within many agri-environment schemes. Grassland accounts for 81 million
   ha of land within the EU; however, the ecology of field margins
   associated with permanent grassland has not been well studied.
   2. This study investigated the effects of experimental field margin
   measures on hymenopteran parasitoid communities over a 5-year period.
   Hymenopteran parasitoids were chosen because they occupy high trophic
   levels, feed on a diverse range of plant and invertebrate hosts, and are
   considered good indicators of arthropod diversity. Establishment methods
   included: fencing, natural regeneration, and reseeding with a wildflower
   mixture, at three margin widths.
   3. Field margin establishment method had a significant effect on
   abundance of parasitoids. Establishment method did not have a
   significant effect on parasitoid genera diversity, but did affect
   parasitoid community composition. Margin width had no significant impact
   on parasitoid communities.
   4. Grazing had a significant negative effect on parasitoid genus
   richness and community structure. This suggests that structural
   diversity of vegetation plays an important role in parasitoid community
   structure.
   5. Plant species richness did not significantly affect parasitoid
   abundance or genera richness. Noxious species within plots resulted in a
   significantly greater abundance and diversity of parasitoids and of
   idiobionts in particular.
   6. Where plant species richness is limited, simple measures such as

Abstract = {{1. Remotely sensed data are frequently employed for monitoring
   vegetation and for estimating herbivore diversity. Their use for
   predicting predator arthropod species abundance and richness has also
   been investigated with success for ants and beetles in forests using
   normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) and for beetles in
   mountain forests using light detection and ranging data.
   2. We investigated whether vegetation indices, derived from
   multispectral SPOT imagery could predict abundance and species richness
   of ground active spiders and ground beetles in a new ecological context,
   the floodplain meadows of the Loire River in Western Europe. Using
   pitfall traps, we collected carabids and spiders in the field.
   3. Maximum vegetation height, litter-depth and plant species richness
   best explained species assemblages of both groups (multivariate
   analyses). NDVI and enhanced vegetation index (EVI 2) were strongly
   related to activity-density and species richness for ground beetles
   only, EVI 2 being the best surrogate. Relationships between vegetation
   indices and spider assemblage patterns were either non-significant or
   weak.
   4. We demonstrated that EVI 2 is a good surrogate of the abundance and
   richness of carabid species in a temperate floodplain, and has potential
   as a low cost method for mapping arthropod assemblages at large spatial
   scales.
   5. Our approach provides a tool which contributes to biodiversity
   assessment at large spatial scales. It can also contribute to the
   prioritisation of conservation areas and early change detection, as
   carabids are keystone indicators.}},

   residents and colonists increased with grazing pressure. As compared
   with perennials, many species among the colonists had strong affinity to

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Fire is an important component of many natural ecosystems affecting
   plant communities and arthropods by mortality during combustion and/or
   indirectly through the modification of the habitat. The Ibera Natural
   Reserve (INR) is one of the most diverse ecosystems in northern
   Argentina; it is dominated by grasslands commonly affected by
   disturbances, such as grazing and fire. The objective of this work was
   to study the response of ground-foraging ant assemblages, particular
   species, and functional groups to an extended fire of high intensity in
   four natural INR habitats with >5 years of cattle exclusion (strict
   conservation area). A total of 12,798 ant workers of 67 species were
   captured in 39 sampling stations. The ant fauna was less abundant in
   burned sites only a few days after the fire; 6 months later, no effect
   was detected. Richness and abundance of ants differed among unburned
   habitats. However, fire effect on species richness and composition
   remained unclear. The rapid recovery of the ant fauna made these insects
   poor indicators of long-term fire-promoted changes on biodiversity in
   open habitats dominated by grassland, though some ant species showed a
   high level of habitat fidelity mainly in unburned habitats. These
   results agree with those from other areas of the world, indicating that
   ants are particularly unreliable biodiversity indicators, with the
   exception of severe disturbance with long-term habitat restoration.
   Management decisions at the INR should be oriented to preserve the
   closed savanna, one of the most diverse and threatened habitat of
   Argentina.}},

Abstract = {{The desert steppe exclosure system was constructed in 2003 to implement
   the Chinese policy that banned livestock grazing to permit recovery of
   overgrazed rangeland. Empirical data on the effectiveness of excluding
   livestock grazing on restoring degraded desert soils and vegetation in
   western China is limited. Additional data are necessary for making
   alternative grassland management decisions and implementing effective
   subsidy policy. In this paper, desert vegetation in an extremely dry
   area, which was fenced to exclude winter sheep grazing in 2003, was
   compared to adjacent sites where winter grazing has been continued.
   Vegetation was sampled to determine plant species richness, vegetation
   composition and herb-shrub layer cover. Soil properties were also
   measured. Results showed that excluding sheep grazing from desert steppe
   for 8years increased plant cover and approximately tripled the biomass
   of standing vegetation, especially the shrub component. Livestock
   exclusion was more favorable for the growth of perennial grasses. Annual
   forbs were more abundant in the grazed area than in the ungrazed area.
   Species richness, evenness and diversity as measured by Simpson or
   Shannon-Wiener indices did not differ between the grazed and ungrazed
   areas (0.05), which indicated that species composition of the desert
   vegetation is difficult to restore. Excluding livestock grazing
   increased soil organic carbon in the 0-10cm (by 66\%) and 10-20cm (26\%)
   soil depths, total nitrogen in the 0-10cm (110\%) and 10-20cm (60\%)
   soil depths and total phosphorus in the 0-10cm (114\%) and 10-20cm
   (64\%) soil depths (P<0.05). Our results demonstrated that vegetation
   biomass and soil properties can be improved by removal of sheep grazing,
   but had less impact on the species richness and diversity in this
   extremely dry region. It also affirms the current central government's
   policy of banning grazing to benefit the recovery of ecological
   services.}},

Abstract = {{The C sequestration capacity of grassland soils depends on both the net
   primary production of the ecosystem that determines the C flows from
   atmosphere to vegetation and soil, and on the mean residence time of C
   within the different compartments. Within grassland ecosystems, C and N
   cycles are strongly coupled by elemental stoichiometry of plant
   autotrophy and of soil microbial heterotrophy. Plasticity in plant form
   and function, plant species diversity and regulation of biological N
   fixation all contribute to stabilize the C:N ratio of organic matter
   inputs to soil. Soil processes such as the priming effect and nitrate
   leaching tend to restore stoichiometry by releasing elements in excess.
   Nevertheless, domestic herbivores tend to uncouple the C and N cycles,
   by releasing digestible C as CO2 and CH4, and by returning digestible N
   at high concentrations in urine patches. At low stocking density,
   herbivores enhance soil N cycling and net primary productivity, leading
   to an increased soil C sequestration, which however declines at high
   stocking density. Assuming no overgrazing, the environmental impacts of
   grassland intensification are therefore controlled by a trade-off
   between increased C N coupling by vegetation and increased C N
   decoupling by animals. Stimulation of vegetation by adequate N and P
   fertilizer applications increases the C flows from the atmosphere to the
   soil, while increasing stocking density reduces mean C residence time
   within the system.
   Intensification of grassland productivity by manipulation of both
   primary production and stocking density leads to complex responses in
   terms of environmental impacts: as intensification increases, positive
   impacts, such as C sequestration are progressively impaired by negative
   impacts linked to excessive active N forms. Hence, in each unique
   environmental setting, a threshold level of grassland intensification
   can be determined above which any additional animal production would be
   associated with unacceptable environmental risks. Improved grassland
   management and integration with crop systems may help minimize the
   harmful environmental effects of C-N decoupling by domestic herbivores,
   thereby enhancing synergies among food production, biodiversity and
   various other ecosystem services. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Heathlands and grasslands occur in montane regions, naturally or due to
   anthropogenic land-use. These are typically nutrient-poor but exposure
   to elevated nitrogen deposition and intensive livestock grazing causes
   large-scale ecological change. We studied the long-term implications of
   grazing removal on soil and drainage water biogeochemistry and the
   implications for nitrogen cycling in 50-year replicated grazing
   exclosures on a montane grassland exposed to high rates of ambient
   nitrogen deposition. Evidence of `ecosystem recovery' represented by
   successional change from graminoid to shrub-dominance after cessation of
   grazing was not reflected in the soil biogeochemistry. Cessation of
   grazing had a negative impact, with increased soil extractable and soil
   solution nitrate concentrations; an apparent shift towards a more
   nitrogen-rich, bacterially dominated microbial community; and the
   acidification of soils and leachate. The increase in nitrate leaching
   appears to have been counterbalanced by a decrease in dissolved organic
   nitrogen leaching, approximately maintaining the overall nitrogen
   balance of the system, whilst apparently altering ecosystem functioning.
   High rates of organic matter cycling and inorganic nitrogen uptake in
   grazed grassland may have sustained ecosystem N limitation under
   elevated nitrogen deposition. Grazing removal caused long-term
   over-supply of nitrogen from mineralisation of enriched organic matter,
   exacerbated by continued high nitrogen deposition, exceeding the uptake
   demand of heath vegetation and resulting in nitrification and nitrate
   leaching. This disequilibrium between vegetation and soil following
   grazing removal has implications for restoration after periods of
   intensive grazing. Grazing may not simply leave a legacy of nutrient
   enrichment but its cessation may trigger nitrogen saturation and soil
   and freshwater eutrophication and acidification which counteract the
   immediate benefits of natural vegetation recovery. Long term, nitrogen
   saturation of abandoned grasslands is likely to reduce ecosystem
   resilience to invasion by nitrophilous species, pathogen attack and
   vulnerability to environmental pressures such as climate change. We
   conclude that partial and/or phased reduction in grazing levels may
   permit the more synchronised recovery of soils and vegetation, thereby
   avoiding imbalances between nitrogen supply and nitrogen demand and
   detrimental ecological effects.}},

   grassland}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{174}},
Pages = {{101-110}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Coastal dunes are dynamic systems maintained and renewed by disturbance.
   Concerns have been raised over shrub and tree encroachment, changes in
   species composition and decreasing species richness in coastal dunes
   with nitrogen (N) deposition and loss of natural dynamics acknowledged
   as pressures. We tested the effects of N-deposition and disturbance on
   Danish dune grassland vegetation. We applied simulated trampling,
   grazing, blowouts and N-deposition in a randomized design to ten sites
   along the major natural gradient in the area. After three years we
   recorded plant, bryophyte and lichen biomass as well as species
   frequency, foliar N and P, soil pH and soil organic matter content. We
   hypothesized that species richness would increase with disturbance and
   decrease with N-addition while biomass was expected to increase with
   N-addition. Disturbance was expected to counteract the effects of
   N-addition. The hypotheses were tested using linear mixed effects models
   on species richness, biomass and phylogenetic community structure with
   treatments and interactions among treatments as explanatory variables
   and site as a random effect. Although N-deposition affected plant
   nutrient balance, the effect of N-addition on vegetation was
   consistently smaller than the effect of disturbance, especially cutting.
   Disturbances all had the opposite effect to N-addition causing an
   increase in species richness and decrease of biomass. The subordinate
   effect of N-addition likely reflects that growth is limited by moisture
   rather than nitrogen. Disturbances apparently relaxed the ecological
   filtering during community assembly, resulting in a more diverse
   community of less related species. Anthropogenic suppression of
   disturbances by wind, coastal erosion or grazing animals may potentially
   be a larger threat to dune biodiversity than increased N-deposition. (C)

Title = {{Vegetation dynamics in a novel ecosystem: agroforestry effects on
   grassland vegetation in Uruguay}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Human activities have resulted in novel ecosystems around the globe, but
   many of these ecosystems are poorly understood, particularly when
   multiple disturbances interact to create novel combinations of species.
   The Campos ecoregion of South America is one of the most extensive
   grasslands globally, yet is unique in the fact that there has been
   little historical evidence of herbivory or fire that traditionally
   maintain grassland ecosystems. Livestock were introduced several
   centuries ago, and afforestation began several decades ago. Introducing
   afforestation to an already grazed system can further alter light
   conditions, soil characteristics, and moisture regimes, which may result
   in decreased species richness, increased plant species introductions,
   and altered abundances of grasses, herbs, and woody species. We examined
   agroforestry management cycle effects on vegetation species richness,
   frequency, and composition in Eucalyptus grandis plantations, studying
   five phases of the management cycle (grassland, young forest, mid-stage
   forest, old forest, and post-harvest). At each of 25 sites, we recorded
   species presence in 40 quadrats (1 m(2)) and categorized species by
   origin (native or introduced) and life form (annual graminoid, annual
   herb, perennial graminoid, perennial herb, woody, or fern). Impacts on
   species richness and composition were greatest in mid-stage forests. The
   proportion of introduced species did not differ by management phase.
   Life form categories responded strongly but differently to management
   phases. Our research suggests that afforestation initially reduces
   vegetation richness and alters composition from that in grasslands,
   although there is considerable recovery following thinning and tree
   harvest. Factors that enhance recovery in this system include the
   presence of disturbance-adapted vegetation, proximity to remnant
   grassland patches, and the short rotation cycles of plantation forests.
   Further research is needed to understand the effects of multiple
   rotations, effects of afforestation on taxa other than plants, and
   consequences of landscape fragmentation across the Campos. While our
   research suggests that afforestation has created a novel ecosystem that
   is a variant of the system that evolved under long-term grazing, the
   extent to which this new condition will evolve over time with the
   continued presence of grazing and repeated forest management cycles
   remains unknown.}},

Abstract = {{Payment for ecosystem services programs are being implemented in a wide
   variety of settings, but whether and in what contexts such programs
   present `win-win' scenarios that simultaneously improve human wellbeing
   and achieve conservation goals remains poorly understood. Based on
   semi-structured interviews with early program participants enrolling
   either collectively- or individually-held land, we evaluated whether and
   how SocioParamo, a national-scale PES program targeting Ecuadorian
   Andean grasslands (paramos), has the potential to contribute to local
   livelihoods (financial, natural, social, human, and physical capital)
   and sustainable resource management. Low conservation opportunity costs
   associated with pre-existing constraints on land use and the existence
   of alternative livelihood options appeared to facilitate largely
   positive financial capital outcomes, although we found reduced financial
   capital among some smaller and medium-sized landholders who were
   required to eliminate burning and grazing We found the greatest
   potential for improved social, financial, and natural capital among
   well-organized community participants enrolling collective land, while
   greater attention to building capacity of individual smaller landholders
   could improve outcomes for those participants. These results help fill a
   gap in knowledge by drawing on empirical data to demonstrate how
   divergent outcomes have begun to emerge among different groups of
   SocioParamo participants, providing lessons for PES program design. (C)

Abstract = {{Despite their considerable relevance as biodiversity hotspots, alpine

   gamma-diversity components in epilithic lichen communities of
   pasturelands in the Maritime Alps (north-west Italy). Our aims were: (1)
   to estimate the shift in functional groups for nitrogen tolerance along
   a gradient of increasing cattle load; (2) to establish the cattle
   critical load. High cattle load reduced the species replacement and
   significantly increased the similarity in the oligotrophic component of
   the lichen communities. The oligotrophic component was the most
   sensitive functional group to nitrogen. Based on the relative abundance
   of oligotrophs we set the cattle critical load of the area at 0.12
   grazing animals per hectare. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and The British

   two exotic grass species. Soil conditions were the most significant
   factor for influencing seedling performance, for both species; the grass
   species used in the pasture was less important. The flooding conditions
   in Gleysols may have potentially limited the seedling growth by
   affecting the height and diameter of C. xanthocarpa. Our results support
   the claim that soil conditions are the primary factors that negatively
   affect the growth and survival of native tree seedlings in abandoned
   farmlands. Restoration efforts that employ fast-growing native species
   should be chosen to increase the chances of restoration success in wet
   pasture areas. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier GmbH.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain areas boast high levels of biodiversity due to the wide variety
   in topography, climates and traditional land-use practices they embrace.
   Recent changes in the mountain agro-ecosystems of Europe have led to a
   decline in these traditional practices (above all grazing) and have had
   negative effects on biodiversity. In this study we evaluated the effects
   of grazing pressure on plant species diversity and also focused on the
   common and rare species diversity, forage quality and forage production
   in the Festuca airoides, Festuca eskia, Festuca gautieri, Festuca
   paniculata and Nardus stricta grassland communities. These analyses
   could be of great importance in identifying the pastoral management
   practices that are most consistent with the conservation of plant
   diversity in the Andorran subalpine and alpine grasslands. Data were
   collected at 113 sampling sites exposed to either high or low grazing
   pressures. In all, 222 vegetation line-transects were established from
   which samples were collected and analysed using the NIRS method. In
   addition the lignin, protein and fibre fractions were obtained in order
   to evaluate the quality of the forage. In the Andorran summer pastures,
   the Festuca gautieri calcareous grasslands had the greatest plant
   species diversity, while the Festuca eskia, Festuca airoides and Nardus
   stricta grasslands had the lowest plant species diversity and a lack of
   common species due to their less homogeneous spatial structure. The
   highest quality forage corresponds to the Festuca gautieri and Nardus
   stricta grasslands, while the Festuca eskia grasslands have the lowest
   quality forage. Although high grazing pressure can lead to greater
   species diversity, it also tends to diminish forage quality and/or
   energy content by increasing the lignin content. Thus, domestic
   livestock is a fundamental element in these grasslands and an increase
   in the grazing pressure of the different types of livestock (cattle,
   sheep and horses) is necessary since a more balanced distribution of
   grazers between the grassland types - rather than an increase in grazers
   will not be sufficient to maintain plant biodiversity. Likewise, there
   is a need to re-establish the practice of transhumance, a traditional
   pastoral practice based on the movement of livestock between winter
   lowland pastures and upland summer pastures. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Disturbances are important drivers in natural ecosystems, affecting the
   vegetation structure and functioning. Invasions of exotic plant species
   are often associated to disturbances in a complex manner, because they
   depend on the type, intensity, spatial and temporal arrangement of
   disturbances, and the particular abiotic and biotic context. Field
   studies that evaluate the dynamics of plant invasions under different
   disturbance regimes have a great importance for the understanding of the
   disturbance effects on invasion spread. In this work we evaluated,
   through a field manipulative experiment, the early colonization and
   expansion dynamics of an aggressive invader of grasslands, Hieracium
   pilosella L., under two disturbance types. We used a split-plot
   experiment by crossing three levels for a local, sporadic, of increasing
   intensity disturbance {[}i.e., 1-undisturbed, 2-vegetation mowing, and
   3-ploughing], within two levels for an extensive and chronic disturbance
   (i.e., grazed and ungrazed). In the range of intensities of disturbance
   evaluated, the intermediate intensity (i.e., mowing) accelerated the
   colonization when it is grazed and the expansion of H. pilosella in
   ungrazed condition. In contrast, lower and higher intensity
   disturbances, such as ungrazed and ploughing treatments decelerated both
   invasion processes. Changes in resource availability, interspecific
   competition and particular characteristics of the invader, i.e., high
   light requirements, prostrate growth and the presence of stolons, could
   explain these early invasion patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Although the effects of non-grazing and heavy grazing on vegetation
   structure have been extensively studied in a wide range of ecosystems,
   the effects of moderate grazing on desert land are still largely
   unknown. Many management opportunities exist for increasing forage
   intake. In order to determine an optimal management method of desert
   rangelands with high heritage value, we examined the respective effects
   of heavy grazing, moderate grazing and non-grazing on total vegetation
   cover, species richness, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and
   rangeland productivity. Sampling was done from 2010 to 2012 (from the
   second year after treatments were imposed) using permanent transects
   under different grazing intensities. While total vegetation cover,
   species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, species composition
   and primary production were significantly greater on the un-grazed site
   and significantly weaker on the heavily grazed site, in contrast,
   moderate grazing had no significant effect on total vegetation cover,
   species richness, Shannon diversity index, species composition and
   primary production. These studies suggest that desert rangelands plant
   communities in general lack response to moderate grazing disturbance,
   and if managed properly they can provide a valuable source of feed for
   livestock.}},

   in an alpine meadow: contrasting short and medium term responses to
   simulated global change}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY 22}},
Abstract = {{We studied the impact of simulated global change on a high alpine meadow
   plant community. Specifically, we examined whether short-term (5 years)
   responses are good predictors for medium-term (7 years) changes in the
   system by applying a factorial warming and nutrient manipulation to 20
   plots in Latnjajaure, subarctic Sweden. Seven years of experimental
   warming and nutrient enhancement caused dramatic shifts in dominance
   hierarchies in response to the nutrient and the combined warming and
   nutrient enhancement treatments. Dominance hierarchies in the meadow
   moved from a community being dominated by cushion plants, deciduous, and
   evergreen shrubs to a community being dominated by grasses, sedges, and
   forbs. Short-termresponses were shown to be inconsistent in their
   ability to predict medium-term responses for most functional groups,
   however, grasses showed a consistent and very substantial increase in
   response to nutrient addition over the seven years. The non-linear
   responses over time point out the importance of longer-term studies with
   repeated measurements to be able to better predict future changes.
   Forecasted changes to temperature and nutrient availability have
   implications for trophic interactions, and may ultimately influence the
   access to and palatability of the forage for grazers. Depending on what
   anthropogenic change will be most pronounced in the future (increase in
   nutrient deposits, warming, or a combination of them both), different
   shifts in community dominance hierarchies may occur. Generally, this
   study supports the productivity-diversity relationship found across
   arctic habitats, with community diversity peaking in mid-productivity
   systems and degrading as nutrient availability increases further. This
   is likely due the increasing competition in plant-plant interactions and
   the shifting dominance structure with grasses taking over the
   experimental plots, suggesting that global change could have high costs
   to biodiversity in the Arctic.}},

Abstract = {{Overgrazing has been the primary cause of grassland degradation in the
   semi-arid grasslands of the agro-pastoral transition zone in northern
   China. However, there has been little evidence regarding grazing
   intensity impacts on vegetation change and soil C and N dynamics in this
   region. This paper reports the effects of four grazing intensities
   namely un-grazed (UG), lightly grazed (LG), moderately grazed (MG) and
   heavily grazed (HG) on vegetation characteristics and soil properties of
   grasslands in the Guyuan county in the agro-pastoral transition region,
   Hebei province, northern China. Our study showed that the vegetation
   height, canopy cover, plant species abundance and aboveground biomass
   decreased significantly with increased grazing intensity. Similarly,
   soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (STN) in the 0-50 cm were
   highest under UG (13.3 kg C m(-2) and 1.69 kg N m(-2)) and lowest under
   HG (9.8 kg C m(-2) and 1.22 kg N m(-2)). Soil available nitrogen (SAN)
   was significantly lower under HG (644 kg N hm(-2)) than under other
   treatments (725-731 kg N hm(-2)) in the 0-50 cm. Our results indicate
   that the pasture management of `'take half-leave half'' has potential
   benefits for primary production and livestock grazing in this region.
   However, grazing exclusion was perhaps the most effective choice for
   restoring degraded grasslands in this region. Therefore, flexible
   rangeland management should be adopted in this region.}},

Title = {{Traditional Cattle Grazing in a Mosaic Alkali Landscape: Effects on
   Grassland Biodiversity along a Moisture Gradient}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{Extensively managed pastures are of crucial importance in sustaining
   biodiversity both in local-and landscape-level. Thus, re-introduction of
   traditional grazing management is a crucial issue in grassland
   conservation actions worldwide. Traditional grazing with robust cattle
   breeds in low stocking rates is considered to be especially useful to
   mimic natural grazing regimes, but well documented case-studies are
   surprisingly rare on this topic. Our goal was to evaluate the
   effectiveness of traditional Hungarian Grey cattle grazing as a
   conservation action in a mosaic alkali landscape. We asked the following
   questions: (i) How does cattle grazing affect species composition and
   diversity of the grasslands? (ii) What are the effects of grazing on
   short-lived and perennial noxious species? (iii) Are there distinct
   effects of grazing in dry-, mesophilous-and wet grassland types?
   Vegetation of fenced and grazed plots in a 200-ha sized habitat complex
   (secondary dry grasslands and pristine mesophilous-and wet alkali
   grasslands) was sampled from 2006-2009 in East-Hungary. We found higher
   diversity scores in grazed plots compared to fenced ones in
   mesophilous-and wet grasslands. Higher cover of noxious species was
   typical in fenced plots compared to their grazed counterparts in the
   last year in every studied grassland type. We found an increasing effect
   of grazing from the dry-towards the wet grassland types. The
   year-to-year differences also followed similar pattern: the
   site-dependent effects were the lowest in the dry grassland and an
   increasing effect was detected along the moisture gradient. We found
   that extensive Hungarian Grey cattle grazing is an effective tool to
   suppress noxious species and to create a mosaic vegetation structure,
   which enables to maintain high species richness in the landscape.
   Hungarian Grey cattle can feed in open habitats along long moisture
   gradient, thus in highly mosaic landscapes this breed can be the most
   suitable livestock type.}},

Abstract = {{Plant community properties such as species richness, evenness, and
   composition vary along environmental gradients. Arid and semi-arid
   ecosystems, such as the central Tibetan Plateau, are thought to be
   sensitive to changes in temperature and water availability, and also
   influenced by a long history of herbivore grazing. We used linear mixed
   effect models and Canonical Correspondence Analysis to explore how plant
   community properties varied along gradients of elevation, soil moisture,
   grazing intensity, solar radiation, ground surface roughness (ground
   concavity), and pika abundance in an alpine meadow ecosystem in central
   Tibet. We found that species richness increased with elevation. Species
   evenness increased with soil moisture at lower elevation, but decreased
   with soil moisture at higher elevation. Species composition was
   significantly associated with all environmental variables except solar
   radiation. The abundance of the dominant plant species, K. pygmaea,
   which is driven primarily by soil moisture, was also an important
   variable. We conclude that open patches (habitat), associated with
   elevation, number of pika burrows and surface roughness, and soil
   moisture and its effects on K pygmaea were the most important
   environmental variables creating variation in plant community properties
   across this landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Tibetan alpine grasslands are viewed to be sensitive to climate change
   and grazing disturbance. But it is not well understood how and to what
   extent grazing exclusion affects species assembly on the Northern
   Tibetan Plateau. We conducted a multisite transect along a precipitation
   gradient to detect species compositional changes at 25 grazed versus
   nongrazed paired pastures in summers of 2009 and 2010 in the Changtang
   Natural Reserve. Species richness and relative frequency were estimated
   for plant functional groups (PFGs: grasses, sedges, forbs, and legumes).
   Species richness at community level responds positively to precipitation
   and differs among vegetation types: meadow (22.63 +/- 1.73) > steppe
   (11.23 +/- 1.00) > desert-steppe (6.75 +/- 0.63). Variations in species
   richness and relative frequency of PFGs are partly dependent on
   vegetation type. Three to four years of grazing exclusion has not
   significantly changed species richness or relative frequency at PFG
   level. Grazing exclusion has slightly changed PFGs' correlations in
   species richness but significantly altered their correlations in
   relative frequency within and across vegetations. Stepwise linear
   regressions indicate that PFGs respond to climate gradients in discrete
   ways. This study implies that specific adaptation mechanisms of
   different taxonomic groups to climatic change and grazing disturbance
   should be seriously considered in further studies.}},

Abstract = {{Wet grasslands of nature conservation importance have been maintained
   for centuries by agricultural management such as grazing and mowing for
   hay, but are now threatened by abandonment despite recent restoration
   initiatives. This paper is the first to synthesise published information
   to elucidate the main patterns, timescales, and consequences of wet
   grassland abandonment with an international perspective, and to evaluate
   restoration success. Results showed that abandonment is a particular
   concern in Europe, especially in central European and Baltic countries,
   but is also a factor in the deterioration of North American wet
   grasslands. In Europe, abandonment peaked in the second half of the 20th
   century, driven by inter-related political and socio-economic changes.
   Nearly all ecological studies of wet grassland abandonment (94\%) focus
   upon vegetation and they reveal that community changes have been
   measured within three years, including species elimination as
   competitors expand and woody plants encroach. However, some wet
   grasslands show resilience as dominant herbaceous species can persist
   for up to 50 years, restricting woody invasion. Herbaceous species
   dominating abandoned grasslands are typically native, tall, productive
   and competitive grasses or sedges, while small, stress-tolerant, rare
   species characteristically decrease. Few studies have measured soil
   properties (II\%) or animals (6\%) during abandonment, although it seems
   that invertebrates may increase (for up to 20 years) and then decline in
   unmanaged wet grasslands. Evidence suggests that wet grasslands that
   have been abandoned for <40 years can be rehabilitated within 10 years
   by reinstating vegetation management, but fully successful restoration
   to a previous condition is elusive. Long-abandoned grasslands may need
   more interventionist restoration efforts to create regeneration niches
   and introduce species. Although managers should assess specific site
   characteristics and potential constraints before restoring abandoned wet
   grasslands, it is recommended that restoration initiatives should
   generally prioritise treeless wet grasslands with low soil nutrients
   that have been abandoned for <20 years. (C) 2013 Elsevier By. All rights

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic changes to ecosystems typically result in decreased
   species richness and abundance relative to that of adjacent
   semi-pristine or pristine areas. Yet, there is debate about the
   generality of this result for bees given that most studies have included
   extremely disturbed areas and are from a limited set of biogeographical
   areas. Repeat sampling of an unusually specialised, species-rich bee
   community was done in the north-western Chihuahuan Desert, North America
   at sites in five habitats (riparian, mesquite forest, abandoned field,
   grassland, and desert scrub) that either had been intensely grazed by
   cattle in the previous year or not been grazed for 22+ years. Species
   density and species composition of bees did not change in response to
   grazing, abundance and proportion of singleton species (those
   represented by one specimen) did. In all habitats, other than the
   riparian, there was lower overall abundance and a greater proportion of
   singleton species at sites that had been recently grazed than at sites
   that had not been grazed since 1979. The proportion of singletons was
   greater in recently grazed than in long-term ungrazed areas, but
   pollen-specialist species did not respond more strongly than pollen
   generalists. The substantial variation in bee abundance and rarity was
   probably associated with differences in floral resources. Overall, lower
   bee abundance in grazed areas reflects the continuous removal by grazers
   of the flowers that bees use. Despite reduced bee abundance due to
   long-term grazing, species richness, and composition in this desert bee
   community remained high.}},

Abstract = {{Soil arthropod communities can provide valuable information regarding
   the impacts of human disturbances on ecosystem structure. Our study
   evaluated the structure, composition and diversity of soil meso-micro
   arthropod communities, in six different vegetation types and assessed
   the impacts of human activity. A completely randomized design, including
   3 replicates from 6 sites (mowing steppe, natural grassland, severe
   degradation grassland, farmland, artificial shelter forest, and wetland)
   was used. Soil samples from the depth of 0 to 20 cm were collected
   during May, July, and September 2007. Soil meso-micro arthropod were
   separated using the Tullgren funnels method, and were identified and
   counted. Soil pH value, organic matter, and total nitrogen were measured
   in topsoil (0-20 cm) from each site. A total of 5,602 soil meso-micro
   arthropod individuals were collected, representing 4 classes, 14 orders,
   and 57 families. Most soil arthropods were widely distributed; however,
   some species appeared to be influenced by environment variables, and
   might serve as bioindicators of adverse human impacts. Canonical
   correspondence analysis indicated the soil arthropod distribution in the
   severely degraded grassland, mowing steppe, farmland, and shelter forest
   differed from the natural grassland. Arthropod density and diversity
   were greatest in May, and the forestland community was the most stable.
   Because of the vital role soil arthropods have in maintaining a healthy
   ecosystem, mechanisms to maintain their abundance and diversity should
   be further evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Question
   To what extent do historical and present-day management regimes and
   landscape characteristics affect the functional structure of
   semi-natural grassland communities?
   Location
   Semi-natural grasslands, the Baltic island of oland, Sweden.
   Methods
   We assessed community functional structure within 475 (50cmx50cm)
   semi-natural grassland vegetation plots using two indices:
   community-weighted mean trait values (CWM) and functional divergence
   (FD), calculated using the Rao quadratic entropy index. Spatially
   explicit regressions were used to assess the extent to which the CWM and
   FD for different plant traits are explained by past and present levels
   of local grazing management, and the present and historical
   characteristics of the surrounding landscape.
   Results
   Across traits, the CWM and FD of individual grasslands were strongly
   associated with current grazing intensity, but also with local
   management history and past landscape structure.
   Conclusions
   Our results indicate that grassland functional structure in the
   fragmented present-day landscape reflects not only present conditions,
   but also the historical context of the grassland fragments - where the
   presence of extensive grassland habitat in the surroundings provided a
   diverse pool of grazing-tolerant species. The study also suggests that
   information on landscape history, and its effects on the local species
   pool, may improve predictions of future plant community structure.}},

Abstract = {{Storage of carbohydrates in organs protected from disturbance is an
   important adaptation of plants in disturbed habitats. We carried out a
   field experiment involving 31 herbaceous plant species in two cultural
   meadows to find out whether roots or belowground stem-derived organs
   (stem bases, stem tubers and rhizomes) are the main storage organs, to
   study how reserves accumulate in individual organs in the long term
   (growing season) and to ascertain whether meadow abandonment affects the
   distribution of carbohydrate reserves in plants. We also conducted a
   22-day pot experiment with four meadow plant species to determine how
   removal of roots and aboveground parts affects the use of carbohydrates
   stored in roots and stem-derived organs in the short term. From the
   long-term perspective of the field experiment, mowing had a positive
   effect on the concentration of carbohydrate reserves. From the
   short-term perspective of the pot experiment, however, the effect on
   concentration and pools of carbohydrates was negative. In the field
   experiment, carbohydrate concentrations before winter were generally
   higher than in mid-season, and more often higher in roots than in
   stem-derived organs. Roots and stem-derived organs of plants in the pot
   experiment were depleted similarly after both types of disturbance. Our
   results indicate a need for including both types of belowground plant
   organs in future studies of the carbon economy of plants from disturbed
   habitats.}},

Volume = {{175}},

Pages = {{305-313}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal limitation between habitat fragments is a known driver of
   landscape-scale biodiversity loss. In Europe, agricultural
   intensification during the twentieth century resulted in losses of both
   grassland habitat and traditional grassland seed dispersal vectors such
   as livestock. During the same period, populations of large wild
   herbivores have increased in the landscape. Usually studied in woodland
   ecosystems, these animals are found to disperse seeds from grasslands
   and other open habitats. We studied endozoochorous seed dispersal by roe
   deer (Capreolus capreolus) in fragmented grasslands and grassland
   remnants, comparing dispersed subcommunities of plant species to those
   in the established vegetation and the seed bank. A total of 652
   seedlings of 67 species emerged from 219 samples of roe deer dung. This
   included many grassland species, and several local grassland
   specialists. Dispersal had potentially different effects on diversity at
   different spatial scales. Almost all sites received seeds of species not
   observed in the vegetation or seed bank at that site, suggesting that
   local diversity might not be dispersal limited. This pattern was less
   evident at the landscape scale, where fewer new species were introduced.
   Nonetheless, long-distance dispersal by large wild herbivores might
   still provide connectivity between fragmented habitats within a
   landscape in the areas in which they are active. Finally, as only a
   subset of the available species were found to disperse in space as well
   as time, the danger of future biodiversity loss might still exist in
   many isolated grassland habitats.}},

Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},

Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{126-133}},

Abstract = {{Landscape ecological networks (ENs) are used to mitigate the negative
   effects of commercial forestry plantations on the biodiversity of
   southern Afromontane grasslands. Annually-burned firebreaks are
   fundamental to plantation forestry management, as they protect timber
   compartments from runaway fires. Here, we investigated the effect of
   annual burning with different levels of domestic cattle grazing in ENs,
   and annual burning without domestic cattle grazing in the adjacent
   protected area (PA). Sampling was conducted on three firebreak types, as
   well as two natural control grasslands (in the EN and PA each). The
   first two types (PA firebreaks and peripheral EN firebreaks) were on
   either side of the PA/plantation fenceline. The third type, plantation
   EN firebreaks, had forestry compartments on two sides and heavy cattle
   grazing. Although plant species richness was not significantly affected,
   plant communities of annually-burned firebreaks differed compositionally
   from those in the reference grasslands in the EN and PA respectively.
   Furthermore, plant species turnover was lower in annually-burned
   firebreaks than in reference EN and PA grasslands. Comparisons among
   different annually-burned firebreak types showed no difference in plant
   species richness. However, species composition and turnover of plant
   communities in peripheral EN fenceline firebreaks were similar to those
   of PA fenceline firebreaks, but both differed from the plantation EN
   firebreaks. Plant communities of longer-rotation burned grassland in the
   EN and PA were similar in species richness, composition and turnover.
   Overall, these results indicate that annual burning of firebreaks leads
   to homogeneous plant communities but not necessarily a reduction in
   species richness. High levels of cattle grazing exacerbate the effect of
   annual burning, as in plantation EN firebreaks. We recommend that
   managers should control heavy cattle grazing in annually-burned areas to
   maintain the natural plant communities as much as possible, while at the
   same time protecting the plantation blocks from runaway fires through
   necessary annual burning of appropriate firebreaks. (c) 2014 SAAB.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{591-599}},

Abstract = {{Aim
   Species are lost world-wide because of habitat destruction and
   fragmentation. Impacted communities can exhibit transient dynamics in
   response to such environmental changes, where slow extinctions and
   immigration delay the arrival to a new equilibrium. Life history traits
   such as generation time, resource use and dispersal capacity, as well as
   landscape history can be expected to affect possible extinction debt,
   but few have examined this for multiple taxa in the same study and
   particularly so for arthropods. The aim was to assess under which
   current and historical land use circumstances an extinction debt occurs
   for vascular plants and three insect taxa.
   Location
   South-eastern Sweden.
   Method
   We sampled current species richness of habitat specialist and generalist
   butterflies, bees, hoverflies, and vascular plants in 45 dry to mesic
   semi-natural grassland fragments of various size and degree of
   connectivity, and situated in landscapes with contrasting land use
   conversion history. Habitat loss was estimated in each landscape by
   comparing modern maps to \~{}45year old digitized aerial photographs. An
   extinction debt can be assumed if historical habitat size and
   connectivity better explain current species distribution than current
   habitat variables do.
   Results
   Bees responded rapidly to habitat loss possibly as a result of their
   primary nesting resource being destroyed. Interestingly, species
   richness of specialist plants was best explained by historical habitat
   connectivity, richness of hoverflies by historical habitat area, and
   richness of butterflies by both historical habitat area and
   connectivity, indicating extinction debt for these taxa. Habitat
   generalist butterflies and hoverflies, but not plants and bees,
   exhibited extinction debt mainly in relation to habitat area. No effect
   of landscape type was found on the observed extinction debt.
   Main conclusions
   Slow extinctions of persistent and long-lived plants might explain
   extinction debt for both plants and herbivorous insects linked to these
   plants.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Grassland birds have experienced greater population declines than any
   other guild of birds in North America, and yet we know little about
   habitat use and the affects of management during their non-breeding
   period on wintering grounds. The paucity of information on wintering
   grassland birds limits our ability to develop effective conservation
   strategies. We investigated habitat use by the winter bird community in
   grasslands with restored heterogeneity resulting from the interactive
   effects of fire and grazing. We used 500 m line transects distributed
   across patches (i.e., <13, 13-24, and >24 months post disturbance)
   resulting from spring burning with growing season grazing (April-Sept)
   and quantified avian relative abundance, community structure, and
   probability of patch occupancy while accounting for imperfect detection.
   Grassland structure that resulted from the fire-grazing interaction
   created heterogeneity among patches that influenced avian habitat use
   during winter. Generalist birds such as the Savannah Sparrow
   (Passerculus sandwichensis) and meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) were
   relatively common in all patch types while more specialized species such
   as the Smith's Longspur (Calcarius pictus) and Le Conte's Sparrow
   (Ammodramus leconteii) reached greatest abundance and probability of
   occupancy in the patches with the least and greatest time post
   disturbance, respectively. This research provides novel information on
   the response of wintering birds to restored ecological processes in
   grasslands and can improve efforts to create effective conservation
   strategies. Our findings add to a growing body of literature supporting
   the use of fire and grazing to create a shifting grassland mosaic that
   increases vegetation structural and compositional heterogeneity and
   maximizes native biodiversity within rangeland ecosystems through the
   conservation of natural patterns and processes.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying drivers of species diversity is a major challenge in
   understanding and predicting the dynamics of species-rich semi-natural
   grasslands. In particular in temperate grasslands changes in land use
   and its consequences, i.e. increasing fragmentation, the on-going loss
   of habitat and the declining importance of regional processes such as
   seed dispersal by livestock, are considered key drivers of the diversity
   loss witnessed within the last decades.
   It is a largely unresolved question to what degree current temperate
   grassland communities already reflect a decline of regional processes
   such as longer distance seed dispersal. Answering this question is
   challenging since it requires both a mechanistic approach to community
   dynamics and a sufficient data basis that allows identifying general
   patterns. Here, we present results of a local individual- and
   trait-based community model that was initialized with plant functional
   types (PFTs) derived from an extensive empirical data set of
   species-rich grasslands within the `Biodiversity Exploratories' in
   Germany. Driving model processes included above- and belowground
   competition, dynamic resource allocation to shoots and roots, clonal
   growth, grazing, and local seed dispersal. To test for the impact of
   regional processes we also simulated seed input from a regional species
   pool. Model output, with and without regional seed input, was compared
   with empirical community response patterns along a grazing gradient.
   Simulated response patterns of changes in PFT richness, Shannon
   diversity, and biomass production matched observed grazing response
   patterns surprisingly well if only local processes were considered.
   Already low levels of additional regional seed input led to stronger
   deviations from empirical community pattern. While these findings cannot
   rule out that regional processes other than those considered in the
   modeling study potentially play a role in shaping the local grassland
   communities, our comparison indicates that European grasslands are
   largely isolated, i.e. local mechanisms explain observed community
   patterns to a large extent.}},

Abstract = {{In many grassland ecosystems, mowing, nitrogen (N) addition, and
   watering are carried out to improve plant productivity for the
   development of livestock husbandry. However, as a result of human
   activities, N deposition rate is predicted to increase and precipitation
   is Expected to change. These environmental changes affect biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning, and most of the previous studies have
   primarily focused on their effects on macro-organisms, neglecting the
   responses of soil microbial communities. In this study, we examined the
   changes in three community attributes (abundance, richness, and
   composition) of the entire bacterial kingdom and 16 dominant bacterial
   phyla/classes in response to mowing, N addition, watering, and their
   combinations, by conducting a 5-year experiment in a steppe ecosystem in
   Inner Mongolia, China. Overall, various bacterial groups responded
   differentially to these experimental treatments, with Acidobacteria,
   Proteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and
   Gammaproteobacteria being the most sensitive. Furthermore, the
   treatments produced different effects, with N addition and watering
   having much greater effects than mowing. Addition of N primarily
   affected these bacterial groups by reducing soil pH, while watering
   affected the bacterial groups by elevating both soil water content and
   soil pH. As N addition and watering had contrasting effects on soil pH,
   they also produced counteractive effects on many bacterial groups. The
   counteractive effects of N addition and watering suggest that the
   combination of these two treatments or the concurrence of N deposition
   and increased precipitation may be helpful for the maintenance of soil
   bacterial diversity and their ecosystem functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Human alterations to nutrient cycles(1,2) and herbivore communities(3-7)
   are affecting global biodiversity dramatically(2). Ecological theory
   predicts these changes should be strongly counteractive: nutrient
   addition drives plant species loss through intensified competition for
   light, whereas herbivores prevent competitive exclusion by increasing
   ground-level light, particularly in productive systems(8,9). Here we use
   experimental data spanning a globally relevant range of conditions to
   test the hypothesis that herbaceous plant species losses caused by
   eutrophication may be offset by increased light availability due to
   herbivory. This experiment, replicated in 40 grasslands on 6 continents,
   demonstrates that nutrients and herbivores can serve as counteracting
   forces to control local plant diversity through light limitation,
   independent of site productivity, soil nitrogen, herbivore type and
   climate. Nutrient addition consistently reduced local diversity through
   light limitation, and herbivory rescued diversity at sites where it
   alleviated light limitation. Thus, species loss from anthropogenic
   eutrophication can be ameliorated in grasslands where herbivory
   increases ground-level light.}},

Abstract = {{Land use intensification reduces natural areas and alters landscape
   heterogeneity diminishing species richness and changing ecosystem
   functionality. The analysis of interaction networks is a useful tool for
   estimating the degree of change experienced by ecosystems. Here,
   plant-floral visitor networks from fragments of grassland restored by
   agricultural activities discontinued over a long time were compared with
   networks from agriculturalized fragments nearby. The hypothesis
   evaluated was that land use intensification changes the structure of the
   original networks by modifying species richness and the network degree
   of specialization. The study was carried out at three sites located over
   a 700 km transect across the provinces of Buenos Aires and La Pampa,
   Argentina. At each site, four fragments were selected (two restored and
   two agricultural). Five monthly samplings were taken between November
   and March along three consecutive years. Entomophilous plants and their
   floral visitors were identified and all plant-floral visitor
   interactions were recorded. With these data, richness of plants and
   visitors were calculated, interaction networks were constructed and the
   degree of specialization was calculated for each network. Land use
   intensification caused changes in the community composition and degree
   of specialization. When cropping was the predominant farming enterprise,
   richness of floral visitors and plants decreased as compared to restored
   fragments. When cattle production was the predominant land use, richness
   of floral visitors remained stable. However, at one of the sites plants
   richness was 48\% higher in the grazed fragments than in those restored.
   In the agricultural fragments, the abundance of units of floral
   attraction due to exotic plants increased, but the visitation rates were
   the same as in the restored fragments. The networks in the agricultural
   fragments were more generalist than in restored fragments, in agreement
   with previous studies on the effect of land use intensification on
   natural systems. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare distribution and assemblage
   structures in centipedes and millipedes in pastures with different
   management arrangements. The evaluated types of management included
   sheep grazing, mowing, mulching and various combinations of these
   treatments. Different foundation modes of pasture were also evaluated -
   commercial mixtures of fodder crops, local mixtures of seeds with
   different proportions of dicotyledonous herbs, and spontaneous fallow
   land. Despite low abundance of both centipedes and millipedes, the most
   positive effect observed in millipedes was in mulching due to the
   surplus of dead organic matter. The best way to manage pasture is to use
   a mixture of local seeds with a high proportion of dicotyledonous herbs
   as food of higher substantiality compared to grass.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes two payment for ecosystem services (PES) programs
   to restore grassland ecosystems in Inner Mongolia in Northern China. A
   key challenge is to sustain the livelihood of local residents, who earn
   most of their income from traditional animal husbandry. We surveyed 240
   herders and 36 government representatives in 2 years. We used contingent
   valuation and logistic regression to analyze the resulting data. Since
   the PES implementation, income from cultivation and animal grazing
   decreased, whereas income from compensation and off-farm activities
   increased. The herders preferred an annual payment of 625 Chinese yuan.
   (CNY) ha(-1) for participating in conservation activities, but the
   government prefers to provide 528 CNY ha(-1), resulting in an annual gap
   of 97 CNY ha(-1). The current too-low payments may lead some herders to
   expand their grazing into restricted grassland or increase their number
   of animals, particularly if either payment program ends. The herders
   were most concerned about their economic loss, whereas the government
   considered both grassland restoration and income protection to be
   important. To create an improved and sustainable PES scheme, we
   recommend solutions that will let the herders sustain their livelihood
   while conserving the grasslands. Our findings will help to establish
   more effective PES schemes for the grasslands of Inner Mongolia and
   similar regions.}},

Abstract = {{Even when no baseline data are available, the impacts of 150 years of
   livestock grazing on natural grasslands can be assessed using a combined
   approach of grazing manipulation and regional-scale assessment of the
   flora. Here, we demonstrate the efficacy of this method across 18 sites
   in the semidesert Mitchell grasslands of northeastern Australia.
   Fifteen-year-old exclosures (ungrazed and macropod grazed) revealed that
   the dominant perennial grasses in the genus Astrebla do not respond
   negatively to grazing disturbance typical of commercial pastoralism.
   Neutral, positive, intermediate, and negative responses to grazing
   disturbance were recorded amongst plant species with no single life-form
   group associated with any response type. Only one exotic species,
   Cenchrus ciliaris, was recorded at low frequency. The strongest negative
   response was from a native annual grass, Chionachne hubbardiana, an
   example of a species that is highly sensitive to grazing disturbance.
   Herbarium records revealed only scant evidence that species with a
   negative response to grazing have declined through the period of
   commercial pastoralism. A regional analysis identified 14 from a total
   of 433 plant species in the regional flora that may be rare and
   potentially threatened by grazing disturbance. However, a targeted
   survey precluded grazing as a cause of decline for seven of these based
   on low palatability and positive responses to grazing and other
   disturbance. Our findings suggest that livestock grazing of semidesert
   grasslands with a short evolutionary history of ungulate grazing has
   altered plant composition, but has not caused declines in the dominant
   perennial grasses or in species richness as predicted by the preceding
   literature. The biggest impact of commercial pastoralism is the spread
   of woody leguminous trees that can transform grassland to thorny
   shrubland. The conservation of plant biodiversity is largely compatible
   with commercial pastoralism provided these woody weeds are controlled,
   but reserves strategically positioned within water remote areas are
   necessary to protect grazing-sensitive species. This study demonstrates
   that a combination of experimental studies and regional surveys can be
   used to understand anthropogenic impacts on natural ecosystems where
   reference habitat is not available.}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{215-224}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{During the past 150 years forest management has dramatically altered in
   Central European woodlands, with severe consequences for biodiversity.
   Light forests that fulfilled variable human demands were replaced by
   dark high forests that function solely as wood plantations. In the Alps,
   by contrast, open woodlands are still present because the traditional
   land use as wood pasture has remained and physiographical conditions
   favour natural dynamics. The aim of our study was to investigate the
   effects of succession on the Orthoptera communities of alluvial pine
   woodlands in the northern Alps. Orthoptera showed a clear response to
   succession, with each successional stage harbouring a unique assemblage.
   The influence of succession on species richness and abundance were
   identical: The values were highest in the intermediate and lowest in the
   late seral stage. The diversity and abundance peak in the
   mid-successional stage probably reflects a trade-off between favourable
   ambient temperatures for optimal development and sufficient food,
   oviposition sites and shelter against predators. Food shortage and easy
   access for predators seemed to be limiting factors in the early
   successional stage. In contrast, in the late successional stage adverse
   microclimatic conditions probably limit Orthoptera occurrence. Although
   all three successional stages of the pine woodlands are relevant for
   conservation, the early and mid-successional stages are the most
   important ones. Conservation management for Orthoptera in this woodland
   type should aim at the reintroduction of cattle grazing and the
   restoration of the natural discharge and bedload-transport regimes of
   the alpine rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining biodiversity is central to maintaining ecosystem
   functionality of wetlands. Hydrology has the strongest influence on
   wetland biodiversity, second to which agriculture is the most
   influential factor. This study investigates the influence of hydrology
   and farming practices on the abundance, species richness and composition
   of dipteran communities on temperate Atlantic floodplain hay meadows.
   Insects were sampled by sweep-net across twenty-four vegetation zones
   for which hydrological variables were calculated by combining river
   level data with fine-scale topographical data. Plant communities were
   surveyed using relev,s and land owners were interviewed to gather data
   on current and past management regimes. A total of twenty-two sciomyzid
   species were recorded; over one-third of the Irish fauna. Flood depth
   and duration were found to have the strongest influence on sciomyzids,
   syrphids and plants. Sciomyzid species richness and total abundance were
   both positively correlated with hydroperiod and flood depth while both
   plants and syrphids responded negatively to increases. The difference in
   response highlights the need to assess more than one taxonomic group,
   when assessing the impact of changing environmental variables on
   biodiversity. Whereas vegetation structure drives changes in sciomyzid
   indicator species, plant species richness and composition, past
   management regimes and current nutrient inputs do not appear to
   influence these species. Thus, while the maintenance of the hydrological
   heterogeneity and the diversity of mowing regimes is important in
   maintaining biodiversity, variation in nutrient inputs and previous
   management (at least within the range here investigated) is likely to be
   of lesser importance for Syrphidae and Sciomyzidae.}},

Abstract = {{Passive restoration methods offer great promise for tropical regions
   where resources are limited but the success of such efforts can be
   variable. Using trait-based theory, we investigated the likely
   trajectories of passive restoration efforts in a degraded Nigerian
   montane forest system recently protected from burning and cattle
   grazing. We quantified the density, species richness, and functional
   trait dispersion of dispersed seeds and seedling communities at
   increasing distances from the forest edge. We then determined which
   plant traits are responsible for colonisation by quantifying changes in
   functional-trait dispersion and relative frequencies of dispersal-linked
   traits with increasing distance from the forest. We found a rapid
   decrease in density and species richness, and significant species
   turnover in both seeds and seedlings just beyond the forest edge. This
   was mirrored by a significant decline in functional-trait dispersion and
   a shift in the relative frequencies of dispersal-linked traits. These
   findings suggest that the reassembly of plant communities adjacent to
   remnant forest is dependent on functional traits present in these
   remnant source populations, providing support for the incorporation of
   trait-based theory in restoration management. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson

Abstract = {{High Andean cloud forests are home to a diversity of unique wildlife and
   are important providers of ecosystem services to people in the Andean
   regions. The extent of these cloud forests has been widely reduced
   through conversion to pasture for livestock, which threatens the
   forests' ability to support biodiversity and provide ecosystem services.
   This paper explores whether impacts on woody plant biodiversity and four
   ecosystem properties (woody plant species richness, juvenile timber tree
   abundance, soil organic matter content and soil moisture) from
   converting forest to pasture can be mitigated if some woody forest
   vegetation is maintained within pastures. Woody vegetation in pastures
   was found to conserve those woody plant species that are more tolerant
   to exposure and grazing, but conservation of the high montane cloud
   forest community required areas of forest from which livestock were
   restricted. The sampled sites clustered according to woody plant species
   cover; these clusters represented a gradient from pasture with patches
   of shrubs to mature forest. Clusters differed in both woody plant
   species richness and number of juvenile timber trees whereas soil
   organic matter and soil moisture were observed to be similar among all
   clusters. This suggests that the different habitats may have some
   equivalent ecosystem properties. We conclude that the presence of woody
   vegetation in pastures may reduce some of the impacts of converting
   forest to pasture, but should not be considered a substitute for
   protecting large areas of forest, which are essential for maintaining
   woody plant species diversity in high Andean cloud forest.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The future of biodiversity and ecosystem services depends largely on the
   capacity of human-dominated ecosystems to support them, yet this
   capacity remains largely unknown. Using the framework of countryside
   biogeography, and working in the Las Cruces system of Coto Brus, Costa
   Rica, we assessed reptile and amphibian assemblages within four habitats
   that typify much of the Neotropics: sun coffee plantations (12 sites),
   pasture (12 sites), remnant forest elements (12 sites), and a larger,
   contiguous protected forest (3 sites in one forest). Through analysis of
   1678 captures of 67 species, we draw four primary conclusions. First, we
   found that the majority of reptile (60\%) and amphibian (70\%) species
   in this study used an array of habitat types, including coffee
   plantations and actively grazed pastures. Second, we found that coffee
   plantations and pastures hosted rich, albeit different and less dense,
   reptile and amphibian biodiversity relative to the 326-ha Las Cruces
   Forest Reserve and neighboring forest elements. Third, we found that the
   small ribbons of ``countryside forest elements{''} weaving through
   farmland collectively increased the effective size of a 326-ha local
   forest reserve 16-fold for reptiles and 14-fold for amphibians within
   our 236-km(2) study area. Therefore, countryside forest elements, often
   too small for most remote sensing techniques to identify, are
   contributing similar to 95\% of the available habitat for
   forest-dependent reptiles and amphibians in our largely human-dominated
   study region. Fourth, we found large and pond-reproducing amphibians to
   prefer human-made habitats, whereas small, stream-reproducing, and
   directly developing species are more dependent on forest elements. Our
   investigation demonstrates that tropical farming landscapes can support
   substantial reptile and amphibian biodiversity. Our approach provides a
   framework for estimating the conservation value of the complex working
   landscapes that constitute roughly half of the global land surface, and
   which are experiencing intensification pressure worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{There is empirical evidence that the proportions of different land uses
   or management regimes and their spatial arrangements can affect the
   long-term dynamics of bird species in agro-landscapes. The aim of our
   study was to assess the extent to which biodiversity can be enhanced by
   altering landscape structure without reducing agricultural production.
   We focused on a wader bird, the Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), in
   grassland landscapes in the Marais Poitevin area (France). For the
   purposes of our study, we developed a spatially explicit, dynamic model
   linking grass dynamics in grazed and mowed fields to lapwing population
   dynamics on a landscape scale. We then computed contrasting landscapes
   composed of fields with different management regimes that compensated
   for or complemented each other. The mechanism of compensation
   corresponded to the case where one management regime is favorable to a
   species, and the other is less so. The mechanism of complementation
   corresponded to the case where each of two management regimes is
   partially favorable to a species. Our results showed that the relative
   share of different management regimes was the main driver of Northern
   Lapwing dynamics in landscapes characterized by compensatory management
   regimes. In landscapes characterized by complementary management
   regimes, the spatial arrangement of the management regimes was also an
   important, albeit secondary, driver of bird population dynamics.
   Managing the spatial arrangement of management regimes is a way to
   improve the trade-off between ecological and agricultural performances
   on a landscape scale by improving ecological performances without
   altering the level of production. Landscape heterogeneity appears to be
   a promising way to reconcile the agricultural and ecological functions
   of agriculture, although it raises several issues concerning collective
   management. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural land abandonment is one of the main drivers of land use
   change, leading to various responses of farmland ecological communities.
   In an effort to better understand the effect of agricultural land
   abandonment on passerine bird communities, we sampled 20 randomly
   selected sites {[}1 km x 1 km] in remote Greek mountains, reflecting an
   abandonment gradient, in terms of forest encroachment. We sampled 169
   plots using the point count method of fixed distance (47 passerine
   species), and we investigated bird diversity and community structure
   turnover along the gradient. We found that grazing intensity has a
   beneficial effect hampering forest encroachment that follows
   progressively land abandonment. Habitat composition changes gradually
   with forests developing at the expense of open meadows and heterogeneous
   grasslands. Forest encroachment has a significant negative effect on
   bird diversity and species richness, affecting in particular typical
   farmland and Mediterranean shrubland species. Birds form five distinct
   ecological clusters after land abandonment: species mostly found in
   pinewoods and cavity-dwelling species; species that prefer open forests
   forest edges or ecotones; species that prefer shrubland or open habitats
   with scattered woody vegetation; Mediterranean farmland birds that
   prefer semi-open habitats with hedges and/or woodlots; and, generalist
   forest-dwelling or shrubland species. We extracted a set of 22 species
   to represent the above ecological communities, as a new monitoring tool
   for agricultural land use change and conservation. We suggest that the
   maintenance of rural mosaics should be included in the priorities of
   agricultural policy for farmland bird diversity conservation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Exotic plant invasions are thought to alter productivity and species

   invaded disturbed and undisturbed subplots in and out of rodent

   biomass and species richness compared with no-seeds-added controls, with
   exotics having disproportionate effects on productivity compared with
   natives. Disturbance enhanced the effects of seed addition on
   productivity and species richness, whereas rodents reduced productivity,
   but only in Germany and California. Our results demonstrate that
   experimental introduction of novel species can alter ecosystem function
   and community structure, but that local filters such as competition and
   herbivory influence the magnitude of these impacts.}},

Journal = {{ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{458-472}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Mowing is known to favor plant diversity and influence ecosystem
   functioning in semi-natural grasslands. This effect could be influenced
   by climate variability, especially in regions with harsh climate, such
   as subalpine zones. In particular, short-term extreme weather
   fluctuations may induce rapid plant responses, affecting in turn the
   response to mowing. We tested the effects of concomitant summer weather
   manipulation and mowing on a subalpine grassland in the Central French
   Alps for two consecutive years. We addressed two questions: (1) How is a
   subalpine grassland affected by extreme summer weather? (2) Does extreme
   summer weather alter mowing effects on the grassland plant diversity and
   functioning? We used a multi-level, integrative approach assessing the
   responses of six abundant plant species, as well as effects on plant
   community structure, biomass production, and litter decomposition rates.
   Extreme summer weather was simulated by increasing summer temperature by
   1.1A degrees C, and decreasing summer rainfall by 80\%-resulting in a
   30\% decrease in total annual precipitation. In addition, a heat-wave
   event was simulated during the first year of the experiment. This
   weather manipulation was combined with a late-summer mowing treatment
   (mown vs. unmown). Extreme summer weather mainly increased leaf
   senescence and decreased plant vegetative growth. Leaf litter
   decomposition was slowed, but only for species characterized by the
   fastest rates of litter decomposition. Mowing increased plant diversity
   by restricting the dominant grass species, thereby favoring
   subordinates. In the short term, this subalpine grassland was rather
   resistant to extreme summer weather, whereas mowing cessation remained
   the main factor affecting its biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Homogeneous and patchy inputs of inorganic and organic nitrogen (N) are
   common in grazed grasslands, but little is known about the interactions
   between spatial pattern and form of N inputs for plant and soil
   processes. Understanding coupled plant and soil responses to
   heterogeneous N inputs is a critical step towards the improved
   prediction of field-scale ecosystem function. We compared impacts of
   uniform and patchy N addition on plant and soil properties using three N
   forms of increasing complexity (inorganic N; a simple amino acid,
   glycine; a complex protein, BSA) in an in situ grassland experiment. One
   month after N addition, patchy N treatments increased plant production
   but decreased biomass produced per gram nitrogen (a proxy of N use
   efficiency) compared with uniform N treatments. Contrary to
   expectations, plant production showed limited differences among N form
   treatments. However, microbial biomass and dissolved organic carbon
   showed significant N form x pattern interactions, with strongest
   responses to patchy inputs of complex organic N. Irrespective of N form,
   plant responses to patchy N inputs occurred over a larger spatial area
   than soil microbe responses, consistent with optimal foraging by plant
   roots. Unlike plants, microbial responses to patchy N inputs were still
   observed after six months. Overall, our results indicate that patchy
   inputs of N promote the uncoupling of plant and soil properties, with
   greatest differences observed for complex organic N inputs. The spatial
   and temporal asynchrony between plant production and microbial biomass
   observed may have significant implications for the competitive balance
   of plants and soil microbes in space, as well as for plant soil
   feedbacks involved with the regulation of biogeochemical cycling. (C)

   Semi-natural grasslands are important habitats for the conservation of
   biodiversity in Europe. High population densities of toxic Colchicum
   autumnale in these grasslands may cause problems for livestock and the
   marketing of hay. Consequently, farmers may either intensify grassland
   management to reduce C. autumnale in the fodder or abandon the land;
   both practices will lead to a loss of biodiversity. Previous studies
   suggesting early cutting to control C. autumnale did not consider
   population dynamics and the effects on plant diversity.
   We conducted a four-year experiment in six regions within Austria and
   Germany, applying five cutting treatments in 16 C. autumnale populations
   to test the effects of cutting date and frequency on C. autumnale and
   co-occurring vegetation. Demographic data were evaluated with matrix
   population models, life-table response experiment (LTRE), anova and
   manova. Vegetation data were analysed with multiresponse permutation
   procedures (MRPP), anova and manova.
   Population growth rate was significantly reduced in plots cut in early
   and late May compared to plots cut in June (control).
   Plants cut in late April or early May showed the lowest survival
   probability. Significantly fewer large vegetative plants developed
   capsules in the following year when cut in early or late May. LTRE
   analysis showed that differences in the population growth rate between
   the control and early cut treatments were mainly the result of a reduced
   survival and growth and an increased retrogression to smaller stages.
   Multiresponse permutation procedures revealed no differences in
   vegetation composition between treatments except for one site in 2011.
   There were no differences in Shannon index, evenness or species turnover
   rate within any year.
   Synthesis and applications. The greatest reduction in vitality of
   Colchicum autumnale was observed in grasslands cut in late April or
   early May. After three years of early cutting, no reduction in plant
   species diversity was observed. The second cut should be postponed to
   July to enable seed shed of plants. Grassland management decisions to
   control toxic C. autumnale must be made in close cooperation with nature
   conservation authorities to consider site characteristics and
   requirements of endangered species.

Abstract = {{Question
   Can topsoil removal improve restoration efficiency of several ecological
   engineering techniques (nurse species seeding, hay transfer and soil
   transfer) for restoring a Mediterranean steppe, species-rich plant
   community?
   Location
   La Crau area, southeast France (Provence).
   Methods
   After the rehabilitation of a 357-ha herbaceous, sheep-grazed rangeland
   suitable for threatened steppe birds in a formerly abandoned industrial
   orchard in the last French Mediterranean steppe (La Crau area), four
   experimental treatments were applied, with or without topsoil removal.
   Topsoil was removed on a 5000-m(2) area and the four treatments
   (control, nurse species seeding, hay transfer and soil transfer) were
   applied within this area where topsoil was removed and within the area
   where topsoil was not removed. Three years later, soil chemistry, soil
   seed bank, vegetation cover and height, plant species richness,
   composition and diversity were compared.
   Results
   Removing topsoil partly restored soil conditions and significantly
   reduced the non-target seed bank. Moreover, species richness and
   similarity to the reference steppe was significantly increased with
   topsoil removal. Topsoil removal, combined with soil transfer and hay
   transfer, created a community that most closely resembled the reference
   during the study period.
   Conclusion
   In order to restore plant community composition, topsoil removal is a
   relevant method to increase the efficiency of other ecological
   restoration techniques, especially those that strengthen dispersal
   processes.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Question
   Can plant material transfer combined with topsoil removal be an
   efficient method of restoring Mediterranean meso-xeric grassland plant
   communities? Does increasing topsoil removal depth increase the success
   of plant material transfer establishment?
   Location
   The Camargue, Rhone delta, France.
   Methods
   A small-scale restoration experiment involving Mediterranean meso-xeric
   grasslands was conducted in a former rice field area. During 3yr, plant
   species richness and composition were compared on permanent plots
   subject to the following four treatments: 5cm topsoil removal, 20cm
   topsoil removal, 5cm topsoil removal with plant material transfer, and
   20cm topsoil removal with plant material transfer. Additionally, the
   seed bank at 0- to 5-cm deep, at 5- to 20-cm deep and at 20- to 40-cm
   deep were studied in order to evaluate the effect of topsoil removal.
   Results
   After 4mo, species richness, number of target species and similarity to
   the reference Mediterranean meso-xeric grassland significantly increased
   with plant material transfer relative to the no transfer treatment
   (topsoil removal without transfer). However, we found no significant
   difference in plant species number between the two depths of topsoil
   removal. This can be explained by the absence of any variation in soil
   seed bank between 5cm and 20cm. The species richness and number of
   target species decreased significantly in transfer treatment between the
   first and the second monitoring. Despite this general decrease in the
   first year, the plant material transfer treatment showed significantly
   more target species than the no transfer treatment and a higher
   similarity to the Mediterranean meso-xeric grassland.
   Conclusion
   In order to restore a Mediterranean meso-xeric grassland plant
   community, plant material transfer combined with topsoil removal appears
   to be a relevant method. Removing 5cm of topsoil eliminates half of the
   density of the undesired seed bank in a former rice field. However, the
   ability of target species to establish and persist in restored
   vegetation communities will require good management. Conditions with low
   competition in early stages of succession seem to be essential for
   transferred species to persist, and appropriately timed grazing and
   adequate stocking rates will be needed to limit the negative effects of
   competition.}},

Title = {{Seed bank and its restoration potential in Estonian flooded meadows}},
Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{262-273}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Questions
   What is the overall restoration potential of the persistent soil seed
   bank of abandoned flooded meadows? To what degree does the share of
   typical flooded meadow species in the soil seed bank change during
   secondary succession from traditionally managed hayfields to stages
   overgrown by woody vegetation?
   Location
   Flooded meadows in Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve, central Estonia (26
   degrees 14 ` E, 58 degrees 33 ` N).
   Methods
   The species composition of above-ground vegetation and the persistent
   soil seed bank were investigated with PerMANOVA and non-metric
   multidimensional scaling in mown, 25-yr abandoned and 50-yr abandoned
   sedge and tall forb meadows subjected to annual flooding. Particular
   attention was given to typical flooded meadow species in the persistent
   soil seed bank. General linear models and non-parametric tests were used
   to assess successional trends in seed bank richness, density, similarity
   to target vegetation and percentage of flooded meadow species to assess
   the restoration potential of the soil seed bank.
   Results
   The cessation of traditional management has led to considerable changes
   in both above-ground and seed bank communities, differences between
   successional stages being more pronounced in the soil seed bank. The
   density of the seed bank was higher in abandoned meadows. Diversity in
   the vegetation and soil seed bank was lowest in the 25-yr abandoned tall
   forb meadows. Although the soil seed bank similarity to above-ground
   mown meadows (locally defined target vegetation) was relatively low
   across different successional stages, the proportion of flooded meadow
   species in the seed bank remained high - even after 50-yr abandonment,
   on average 42\% of emerged seeds from sedge meadow and 34\% from tall
   forb meadow were typical flooded meadow species.
   Conclusions
   Abandoned floodplain meadows in central Estonia still contain a
   relatively large grassland community species pool, including a large and
   effective soil seed bank. The soil seed bank could thus play an
   important role in the restoration of abandoned and overgrown meadow
   communities. Targeted experiments addressing the optimal techniques for
   activating the soil seed bank in flooded meadow soil are needed.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the biodiversity-productivity relationship is essential
   for sustainable pasture management. We performed a multi-site transect
   survey across three alpine grassland types, meadow, steppe and desert
   steppe to get some initial insights into how biotic and abiotic factors
   drive both aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and species
   richness (SR). We first explored the SR-ANPP relationship at different
   scales, then examined the relationship between diversity, productivity
   and environmental factors, and finally decomposed the relative
   contribution of each term to observed variations by analyses of
   covariance with general linear models (GLMs). The unimodal pattern, with
   lower corrected Akaike information criterion values, was found slightly
   better fitted than the positive linear one within steppe and across all
   three grassland types, whereas no obvious relationship was observed in
   meadow or desert steppe. We evaluated plant functional group composition
   (FGC), with species scored as 1-xerophytes, 2-mesophytes and
   3-hygrophytes. Both ANPP and SR exponentially increased with growing
   season precipitation (GSP) and logarithmically with FGC. Results from
   GLMs showed that local species pool (LSP) explained 57.5 \% of variation
   in SR and that FGC had an equal power as GSP in explaining variation in
   ANPP (about 31 \%). Results indicate that the SR-ANPP curve is an
   aggregate of concurrent relationships across spatial scales and
   ecological levels. The relationship of the LSP and FGC with
   precipitation indicated a strong dependence between plants and alpine
   climate. Therefore, changes in species composition should be seriously
   considered in alpine vegetation response to potential climate change and
   anthropogenic disturbance.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{We construct a state-and-transition model for mammals in tropical
   savannas in northern Australia to synthesize ecological knowledge and
   understand mammalian declines. We aimed to validate the existence of
   alternative mammal assemblage states similar to those in arid Australian
   grasslands, and to speculate on transition triggers. Based on the arid
   grassland model, we hypothesized that assemblages are partitioned across
   rainfall gradients and between substrates. We also predicted that
   assemblages typical of arid regions in boom periods would be prevalent
   in savannas with higher and more regular rainfall. Data from eight
   mammal surveys from the Kimberley region, Western Australia (1994 to
   2011) were collated. Survey sites were partitioned across rainfall zones
   and habitats. Data allowed us to identify three assemblage states: State
   0:- low numbers of mammals, State II:- dominated by omnivorous rodents
   and State III:- dominated by rodents and larger marsupials. Unlike arid
   grasslands, assemblage dominance by insectivorous dasyurids (State I)
   did not occur in savannas. Mammal assemblages were partitioned across
   rainfall zones and between substrates as predicted, but-unlike arid
   regions-were not related strongly to yearly rainfall. Mammal assemblage
   composition showed high regional stability, probably related to high
   annual rainfall and predictable wet season resource pulses. As a
   consequence, we speculate that perpetually booming assemblages in
   savannas allow top-down control of the ecosystem, with suppression of
   introduced cats by the dingo, the region's top predator. Under
   conditions of low or erratic productivity, imposed increasingly by
   intense fire regimes and introduced herbivore grazing, dingoes may not
   limit impacts of cats on native mammals. These interacting factors may
   explain contemporary declines of savanna mammals as well as historical
   declines in arid Australia. The cat-ecosystem productivity hypothesis
   raised here differs from the already-articulated cat-habitat structure
   hypothesis for mammal declines, and we suggest approaches for explicit
   testing of transition triggers for competing hypotheses.}},

Title = {{Impacts of deer management practices on the spatial dynamics of the tick
   Ixodes ricinus: A scenario analysis}},

Abstract = {{Deer, for example roe deer, red deer and fallow deer, are the common
   reproduction host types for European Ixodes ricinus ticks. Understanding
   the consequences of deer management on the spatial dynamics of ticks may
   advise the risk management of tick-borne diseases, and thus be of public
   health importance. We present a scenario analysis to understand such
   consequences by integrating multi-disciplinary knowledge within a
   predictive modelling framework. A spatial tick population model was
   adopted to explore how changes in the host population may affect
   woodland patch- and landscape-level tick dynamics. Scenarios on current
   and foreseen European deer management strategies were built based on
   expert knowledge. These scenarios were then tested through the described
   model for their potential effectiveness as tick control strategies. Our
   models indicate that: (i) reducing local deer densities could not
   effectively reduce tick abundance if woodland patches are
   well-connected, allowing deer population exchanges, (ii) controlling
   deer grazing intensity in grassland may not be an effective tick control
   strategy, (iii) local extinction of deer could decrease tick abundance
   considerably but deer reintroduction could lead to fast tick upsurge,
   and (iv) controlling human disturbances may reduce the tick density at
   landscape-level, as well as tick ``hotspots{''} (i.e., areas with
   unusually high tick density) at woodland patch-level. Our results can
   instruct policy-makers on the potential impact on public health of
   wildlife management strategies, and suggest empirical investigations of
   disease risks. For optimising such simulation studies on disease risks,
   however, a better understanding of how biodiversity may influence the
   ecology of tick and pathogen transmission is required. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The impact of large herbivores on ecosystems before modern human
   activities is an open question in ecology and conservation. For Europe,
   the controversial wood-pasture hypothesis posits that grazing by wild
   large herbivores supported a dynamic mosaic of vegetation structures at
   the landscape scale under temperate conditions before agriculture. The
   contrasting position suggests that European temperate vegetation was
   primarily closed forest with relatively small open areas, at most
   impacted locally by large herbivores. Given the role of modern humans in
   the world-wide decimations of megafauna during the late Quaternary, to
   resolve this debate it is necessary to understand herbivore-vegetation
   interactions before these losses. Here, a synthetic analysis of beetle
   fossils from Great Britain shows that beetles associated with herbivore
   dung were better represented during the Last Interglacial
   (132,000-110,000 y B. P., before modern human arrival) than in the early
   Holocene (10,000-5,000 y B. P.). Furthermore, beetle assemblages
   indicate closed and partially closed forest in the early Holocene but a
   greater mixture of semiopen vegetation and forest in the Last
   Interglacial. Hence, abundant and diverse large herbivores appear to
   have been associated with high structural diversity of vegetation before
   the megafauna extinctions at the end of the Pleistocene. After these
   losses and in the presence of modern humans, large herbivores generally
   were less abundant, and closed woodland was more prevalent in the early
   Holocene. Our findings point to the importance of the formerly rich
   fauna of large herbivores in sustaining structurally diverse vegetation
   in the temperate forest biome and provide support for recent moves
   toward rewilding-based conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{Farms in the glaciated tallgrass prairie region of North America are
   topographically heterogeneous with wide-ranging soil quality. This
   environmental heterogeneity may affect choice and placement of species
   planted for biomass production. We designed replicated experiments and
   monitored farm-scale production to evaluate the effects of landscape
   position, vegetation type, and year on yields of monocultures and
   mixtures. Research was conducted on a 262-ha South Dakota working farm
   where cropland had been replanted with a variety of native grassland
   types having biofuel feedstock potential. Vegetation type (diverse
   mixture or switchgrass {[}Panicum virgatum L.] monoculture) and year
   interacted to influence yield in replicated experiments (p <0.10). Mean
   annual switchgrass yield above a stubble height of 10 cm was 9.3 Mg
   ha(-1) in two replicated experiments, and was greater than yield of
   mixtures (7.3 Mg ha(-1)) in 6 of 7 year x vegetation type combinations.
   Landscape position interacted with year and vegetation type to influence
   yield (p <0.10). Variability was generally greatest at the lowest
   landscape position. On the farm's larger fields (0.4-46 ha), three-year
   mean yields of switchgrass monocultures cut at ground level (12.7 Mg
   ha(-1)) were also greater than yields of mixtures (9.7 Mg ha(-1)) but
   both were less than prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinata Link)
   monoculture yield (13.2 Mg ha(-1)) in a restored wetland. A combination
   of prairie monocultures and mixtures, strategically placed across a farm
   landscape, could offer a balance of productivity, ecosystem services,
   and income with potential as biofuel feedstock and other income streams
   (hay, seed, beef). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional agro-forest systems (TAFS) link the two ecosystems forest
   and grassland and are an attractive, species-rich land-use type in the
   European cultural landscape. In the past decades, particularly in
   mountainous regions, socio economic changes have resulted in their
   abandonment or intensification of use. Our study employed plant traits
   to analyze and understand the consequences that abandonment and
   intensification have on plant species diversity, functional diversity
   and the provision of ecosystem services of larch (Larix decidua)
   grassland, a TAFS in the European Alps. By applying commonly used traits
   such as growth form and pollination agent, together with less used
   traits such as flower color and edible or healing plants, we found
   highest plant species diversity in traditionally managed larch meadows
   and larch pastures, while functional diversity was seen to be high also
   in abandoned larch grasslands. We further show that provision of the
   ecosystem services scenic beauty and pollination is best in
   traditionally managed larch meadows and larch pastures. Regarding the
   provision of edible or healing plants, the largest species pool was
   found in traditionally managed larch meadows, while the highest species
   coverage was found in intensively managed larch meadows. Summarizing our
   results, we deduce that both the abandonment and intensification of
   larch grasslands result in a loss of plant diversity and a decrease in
   provided ecosystem services. Consequently, enhancement of our knowledge
   through further investigation of TAFS is essential for the maintenance
   and conservation of these valuable cultural ecosystems. (c) 2014

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 12}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the land use history has proven crucial for the
   conservation of biodiversity in the agricultural landscape. In southern
   Sweden, very small and fragmented areas of the disturbance-dependent
   habitat xeric sand calcareous grassland support a large number of
   threatened and rare plants and animals. In order to find out if
   historical land use could explain variation in present-day habitat
   quality, the land use on eight such sites was traced back to the 18th
   century and compared with key factors such as the amount of bare sand,
   lime content and P availability. There was no support for the common
   explanation of the decline in xeric sand calcareous grassland being
   caused by abandonment of agricultural fields during the last century.
   Instead, fertilization history was the main explanation for the
   difference in depletion depth of CaCO3 seen between the sites. The
   decline in xeric sand calcareous grassland since the 18th century is
   most probably the result of the drastic changes in land use during the
   19th century, which put an end to the extensive sand drift. Since
   cultivation was shown to have played an important role in the historical
   land use of xeric sand calcareous grassland, grazing alone may not be
   the optimal management option for these grasslands. Instead more drastic
   measures are needed to restore the high calcium content and maintain
   proper disturbance levels.}},

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Species traits may provide a sort-cut to predicting generalities in
   species turnover in response to environmental change, particularly for
   poorly known taxa. We ask if morphological traits of assemblages respond
   predictably to macrohabitats across a large scale. Ant assemblages were
   collected at nine paired pasture and remnantsites from within three
   areas along a 300 km distance. We measured ten functional morphological
   traits for replicate individuals of each species. We used a fourth
   corner model to test associations between microhabitat variables,
   macrohabitats (pastures and remnants) and traits. In addition, we tested
   the phylogenetic independence of traits, to determine if responses were
   likely to be due to filtering by morphology or pylogeny Nine of ten
   traits were predicted by macrohabitat and the majority of these traits.'
   were independent of phylogeny. Surprisingly, microhabitat variables were
   not associated with morphological traits. Traits which were associated
   with macrohabitats were involved in locomotion, feeding behaviour and
   sensory ability. Ants in remnants had more maxillary palp segments,
   longer scapes and wider eyes, while having shorter femurs smaller apical
   mandibular teeth and shorter Webers lengths. A clear relationship
   between traits and rnacrohabitats across a large scale suggests that
   species are filtered by coarse environmental differences. In contrast to
   the findings of previous studies, fine-scale filtering of morphological
   traits was not apparent. if such generalities in morphological trait
   responses to habitat hold across even larger scales, traits may prove
   critical in predicting the response of species assemblages to global
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Butterflies (Lepidoptera) have attracted more attention as
   bin-indicators of terrestrial ecosystems than other terrestrial
   arthropods. This study determined butterfly species turnover at a priori
   selected habitat patches inside Nduli Nature Reserve and its surrounding
   landscape, and their response to measured environmental variables. Using
   the line transect method, 516 butterfly individuals belonging to 22
   species were sampled from all 16 sampling units (Sus), of which 13
   species occurred in two or more Sus across the study site. Habitat
   patches outside the reserve were higher in butterfly species richness
   and abundance than inside the reserve. Papilio demodocus Esper, Borbo
   gemella Mabille, Precis octavia (Cramer) and Hypolimnas missipus
   (Linnaeus) were each restricted to one sampling unit. Hierarchical
   clustering using Bray-Curtis similarity matrices and correspondence
   analyses grouped sampling units according to butterfly species sampled.
   Canonical correspondence analysis results indicated that certain site
   (environmental) variables, e.g. percentage herb cover, grazing
   intensity, distance to the city centre and average flower density
   accounted for species distribution patterns across Sus. The implications
   of the study suggest that habitat patch level management for
   conservation action should aim at preserving sufficient herb cover and
   nectaring plants, especially during the summer season to cater for all
   developmental stages of butterfly species in the study area.
   Furthermore, species richness within the reserve can be encouraged by
   using vegetation linkages and corridors between the reserve and its
   surrounding landscape. Butterflies identified during the study can serve
   as indicator species for assessing the conservation value of habitat
   patches in the study area and for increasing public awareness of the
   need to conserve butterflies and the invertebrate fauna of the King
   Sabata Dalindyebo Municipality between the months of November and April.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{171}},
Pages = {{44-51}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Across N.W. Europe intensive agricultural management has increased
   productivity to the detriment of floral resources vital for insect
   pollinators like bees, butterflies and hoverflies. While the creation of
   wildflower habitats has been widely used to re-establish such resources
   into arable ecosystems (e.g. sown into field margins), comparable low
   cost methods for enhancing floristic diversity in production grasslands
   are lacking. We investigated how simple and cheep seed mixtures based
   around three plant functional groups (grasses, legumes and
   non-leguminous forbs) could be used to enhance flowering resources to
   benefit insect pollinator communities over a four year period. We
   demonstrate that the abundance and species richness of pollinators was
   correlated with the increased availability of legume and non-legume forb
   flowers. While the flowering resources provided by agricultural
   cultivars of legumes declined rapidly once sown, the inclusion of a forb
   component within seed mixtures was effective in increasing the long-term
   persistence of these resources. As a result the abundance and species
   richness of insect pollinators over the four years showed greater
   stability where forbs were also sown. Sward management also played a
   role in the persistence of floral resources, with grazing more likely to
   maintain legume cover than cutting. In conclusion, we demonstrate that
   low cost seed mixtures can be used to enhance floristic diversity to
   benefit pollinators, although the continued value of these grasslands
   over time is dependent on complementarity between sown legumes and
   forbs. As permanent grassland covers c. 40\% of the UK the enhancement
   of their floristic diversity has a huge potential to benefit insect
   pollinators. The type of land sharing approaches suggested here maintain
   modest agricultural productivity and so may be the most likely to
   achieve benefit to pollinators through wide-scale farmer uptake. (C)

Volume = {{171}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) deposition is a major global threat to biodiversity and
   ecosystem function. Increased deposition rates are linked to reduced
   species richness and vegetation change in a wide range of habitats.
   Here, we use gradients of N deposition and climate across thirty-six
   European sites to examine impacts of N deposition relative to those of
   climatic, soil and grazing conditions, on composition of Racomitrium
   heath, a moss-dominated mountain summit community of high nature
   conservation value. Nitrogen deposition was the second most important
   driver of community composition after climatic conditions at this
   European scale, explaining 15\% of variability, and was more important
   than soil factors or current grazing. Along a gradient of 0.6-39.6 kg N
   ha(-1) y(-1) species richness declined by 5 species m(-2) and there was
   a 30\% shift in cover from mosses to graminoids. Such large changes in
   dominant plant functional type have potential to impact on other biota
   and on habitat functions including nutrient cycling and hydrology.
   Importantly, changes in community composition were seen across the whole
   range of N deposition, with impacts on sensitive components such as
   lichens seen at rates of N deposition only slightly above background. No
   evidence was found for a threshold deposition rate or critical load
   below which no change in composition occurred. This study demonstrates
   the powerful role of N deposition as a driver of plant community change
   relative to other factors, and highlights the sensitivity of alpine
   habitats adapted to low background N deposition levels. (C) 2014

Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The impact of different cutting dates on two dominant groups of
   ground-dwelling arthropods (carabids and spiders) was assessed.
   Short-term impacts were assessed by comparing them before and after
   cutting. Arthropods were collected by pitfall traps located in three
   plots with different cutting dates between June and August and one uncut
   control plot. Trapping was performed during a 4-month period in the
   spring and summer 2011. In total, 26,392 spiders and 12,278 carabids,
   representing 56 and 82 species respectively, were collected. Overall,
   the effects of cutting were negative and mostly visible in the long term
   for carabids, with reduced abundances and species richness in cut plots,
   and in the short-term for spiders; several parameters (proportion of
   predators and polyphagous species, and body length) decreased after
   cutting while remaining stable in the control. Long-term cutting effects
   revealed almost no differences between plots cut at different dates
   whereas the short-term effects decreased slightly over time, with
   respect to the overall phenology of both groups. In conclusion, this
   study underlines the fact that cutting has drastic effects on
   ground-dwelling arthropods, and even late dates, which are supposedly
   positive for other animals like breeding birds, are deleterious for
   highly diverse and species-rich grassland groups. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{20\% loss of unimproved farmland in 22 years in the Engadin, Swiss Alps}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{185}},
Pages = {{48-58}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has reached mountain areas with
   retardation. This development is worrying as it targets some of the last
   remaining strongholds of traditionally farmed land in central Europe
   which are important hotspots of biodiversity. However, large-scale
   documentations of changes in agricultural habitats are rare, but are
   needed to guide agricultural policy for the conservation of
   biodiversity.
   We investigated vegetation changes of the agricultural landscape in a
   valley of the Alps (Engadin, a rather dry valley in Switzerland) between
   1987/1988 and 2009/2010. In 58 plots (total area 1253 ha) we recorded
   changes in vegetation types and the intensity of usage and we
   investigated correlations between these changes and site factors.
   By 2009/2010, all unimproved vegetation types have lost 20\% of the area
   they covered in 1987/1988. The loss was greatest in areas where new
   agricultural infrastructure/reallocation projects
   ({''}ameliorations{''}) had been realized. This observation illustrates
   the potentially devastating effect of such projects for farmland
   biodiversity.
   Overall, intensively used fertile meadows (which are of limited nature
   value) have increased. The afflux came from the above mentioned
   unimproved grassland types, and not, as might be expected, from
   low-intensity fertile meadows (traditional hay meadows with a high
   nature value). In fact, the latter meadow type has seen a net gain from
   the intensively used fertile meadows (i.e. extensification). Both of
   these opposing processes (intensification and extensification) were
   subsidized by the government: money for infrastructure projects on the
   one hand and money for ecological compensation areas on the other hand.
   Abandonment of farmland, unlike in some other regions in the Alps, is
   not a general problem in the Engadin, but it did reduce the area of
   xerotherm grassland by 19\% and of nutrient-poor meadows by 8\%.
   Grazing, which could prevent abandonment, increased during our study
   period, but was mostly of high intensity, thus was not optimal from a
   conservation point of view. Recent contracts for nature conservation are
   likely to help maintain mowing and extensive grazing management on
   marginal land.
   The Engadin remains a biological hotspot and a beautiful landscape of
   high value for tourism. But these values are not secured as illustrated
   by the loss during the last 20 years. Thus, planers of irrigation and
   other infrastructure projects and decision-makers in general need to
   better incorporate both the extant nature values and their fragility
   into their planning. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In arid regions, irrigation is required to secure agricultural
   production including the production of hay. The Valais, a dry inner
   alpine valley of Switzerland, has a long tradition of meadow irrigation.
   However, in the 20th century irrigation was stopped on marginal, poorly
   accessible areas usually accompanied by the entire abandonment of these
   meadows. The aim of this study was to examine the consequences of
   land-use abandonment resulting from the cessation of irrigation for the
   biodiversity of species-rich hay meadows in the Valais. We compared soil
   characteristics and species richness and composition, habitat
   specificity and functional traits of plants and gastropods of three
   serial stages of succession (each five hay meadows, early abandoned
   meadows and young forests). Soil moisture was lower in young forests
   than in the other two stages. Soil nitrogen content decreased following
   abandonment, which was due to the cessation of fertilization. The three
   successional stages did not differ in plant species richness but
   harboured distinct plant communities. Gastropod richness increased with
   progressive succession and species composition of hay meadows differed
   from those of the two other stages. The proportion of grassland (plants)
   and open-land (gastropods) species decreased following abandonment.
   Furthermore, meadow abandonment led to an increase in the height of
   non-woody plant species, a later start of seed shedding, a change in the
   type of plant reproduction and an increase in the shell size of
   gastropods. In conclusion, this study showed that extensive land-use,
   which is strongly linked to irrigation, is required for the
   characteristic species-rich hay meadows of this arid mountain region.

Abstract = {{The interactions between botanical composition of pasture, quality of
   herbage grazed, performances of dairy cows and sensory and nutritional
   properties of dairy products were investigated using an integrated
   system approach. Two contrasting grazing systems were evaluated from May
   to September in two years. The treatments included a continuous grazing
   system (DIV) managed at a lenient stocking rate (1.0 LU ha(-1)) on a
   botanically-rich permanent pasture, and a rotational grazing system
   (PROD) set up at a higher stocking rate (1.7 LU ha(-1)) on a former
   temporary grassland presenting moderate biodiversity. DIV aimed to
   maximize biodiversity and obtain high sensory and nutritional quality
   cheese, whereas PROD was oriented towards milk production and herbage
   quality. In each system, 12 non-feed-supplemented Montbeliarde cows were
   used. The DIV system led to higher milk production per cow in the early
   grazing season than the PROD system (22.2 vs. 19.9 kg d(-1)). At the
   beginning of summer, this milk production pattern was inverted following
   a decrease in grass nutritive value in the DIV system. In parallel, DIV
   cows showed a more marked loss of body condition than PROD cows over the
   season. In terms of milk fatty acid profile, the DIV system proved very
   interesting early in the grazing season but lost its value over time as
   the herbage matured. Cheese sensory properties differed between systems
   only after a long ripening period (6 months). Regarding the ecological
   performances, the DIV plot showed greater botanical and entomological
   biodiversity than the PROD plot. This study provides evidence that the
   balance between animal performances, dairy product quality and
   biodiversity in dairy systems is more complex than previously thought,
   since the expected benefits of each system vary markedly over periods.
   The evolution of herbage vegetation stage during the grazing season
   combined with the botanical composition of the pasture is a key
   component for understanding these variations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The impacts of climate driven change on ecosystem processes and
   biodiversity are pervasive and still not fully understood. Biodiversity
   loss, range shifts, and phenological mismatches are all issues
   associated with a changing climate that are having significant impacts
   on individuals and ecosystems alike. Investigating and identifying
   effective management strategies that can conserve vulnerable species
   should be the focus of current and future climate change research. We
   investigated thermal properties of habitat for an imperiled grouse
   (Greater Prairie-chicken; Tympanuchus cupido) in tallgrass prairie
   characterized by heterogeneous fire and grazing (the fire-grazing
   interaction). We examined operative temperature at varying scales
   relevant to grouse and used historic and forecasted climate data to
   estimate thermal stress during nesting activities. We found that
   heterogeneous grasslands have high thermal variability with operative
   temperature ranging as much as 238 degrees C across the landscape.
   Grouse exhibited strong selection for cooler thermal environments as
   nest sites were as much as 88 degrees C cooler than the surrounding
   landscape, and fine-scale differences in thermal environments were
   nearly 48 degrees C cooler than sites within 2 m of nests. Additionally,
   forecasted climate scenarios indicate grouse will experience 2-4 times
   the number of hours above thermal stress thresholds, emphasizing the
   need for informed conservation management. Overall, these data provide
   evidence that variation in grassland structure resulting from the
   fire-grazing interaction may be important in moderating thermal
   environments and highlights the complex and interactive effects of
   restored ecological processes on ecosystems.}},

   intensive cultivation? A large-scale experiment in southern France}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{202-212}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Ecological restoration has been identified as one of the possible ways
   to replace biodiversity loss. While ecological engineering methods can
   successfully restore some ecosystem attributes, restoration is generally
   incomplete, mainly due to lack of target species propagule dispersal,
   unsuitable abiotic conditions and negative biotic interactions,
   especially after intensive cultivation. How best to restore reference
   ecosystems is therefore a vital research objective, not only on a small
   experimental scale but also on a large scale. This study aimed to
   determine which ecological engineering techniques are the most suitable
   for large-scale restoration of a low-productive species-rich ecosystem
   after intensive cultivation. Experiments were carried out at La Crau in
   southern France, within a 357 ha land rehabilitation project whose aim
   was to recreate a herbaceous sheep-grazed habitat. We investigated: (i)
   covering species seeding, (ii) topsoil removal, (iii) hay transfer, and
   (iv) soil transfer as methods to restore a steppe plant community in
   this rehabilitated area, using the last remaining French Mediterranean
   steppe as a reference ecosystem. Species-richness, diversity and
   composition of vascular plant communities were monitored over three
   years. The rehabilitation made it possible to recover a large area
   dominated by grasses but with vegetation different from that of the
   steppe. Hay transfer was successful in transferring some target species,
   but the number of target species did not significantly increase by the
   end of the third year. Covering species seeding seemed to provide a
   suitable area for target species colonization, but probable competition
   with grasses needs to be monitored. The greatest similarity in richness,
   diversity, and composition with the reference ecosystem was obtained
   with topsoil removal and soil transfer, which made it possible to
   recover the species-richness and, to some extent, the composition of the
   steppe. Our findings show that current ecological restoration and
   ecological engineering techniques can lead to at least partial
   restoration of some ecosystem attributes. However, they also underline
   the importance of in situ conservation of natural habitats rather than
   restoring them after their destruction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Pages = {{15-23}},

Abstract = {{To elucidate the cessation impacts of agricultural management on a
   semi-natural grassland ecosystem, effects of grazing and burning on
   species composition of vascular plants were investigated in Mt. Aso,
   Japan. Species richness was significantly increased by both grazing and
   burning at the plot scale (1m(2)), and a negative interaction between
   grazing and burning was recognized by two-way analysis of variance. No
   significant effect existed at the transect (10m(2)) or the site (20m(2))
   scales. Most of the environmental factors measured in this study (e.g.
   soil physical properties) were significantly, although differently,
   modified by grazing and/or burning. According to logistic regression
   analyses, 32 of 77 species recorded at the study sites were
   significantly correlated with the environmental variables, yet each
   species appeared to respond to the environmental factors in different
   ways. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that both grazing and
   burning are important factors in determining species composition; that
   cessation of grazing changes shortgrass communities to tallgrass ones;
   and that cessation of burning changes communities composed of
   colorful-flowering species to shrubby communities. This study concludes
   that within several years of the cessation of grazing and burning,
   species richness could be lowered in semi-natural grasslands at such
   small scales as 1-m(2) plots. Grazing and burning would modify some
   environmental factors, especially hydraulic conditions, in semi-natural
   grasslands, and would create various habitat types for plants, thus
   allowing species diversity to be maintained over time.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of the scale of observation in vegetation science has
   long been recognized. We have evaluated the effect of grain (plot
   dimension) on the detection of changes induced by shrubs cutting on
   plant composition of a calcareous grassland in Southern Tuscany (Italy).
   We conducted a 2-year before 2-year after-control-impact (BACI) field
   sampling design. We collected the cover of vascular plants using nested
   square quadrats with 0.5, 1 and 2m sides. Any deviation of the restored
   plots from the control was analyzed by using the principal response
   curve (PRC) technique. Differences between the control and the restored
   plots, in time, accounted for 4.5, 3.3 and 7.4 of the between-plot
   variation in species composition, respectively for 0.25, 1 and 4m(2)
   plots, but only the first PRC component of the largest scale was
   statistically significant. The results showed that the ability to
   differentiate the control from the restored plots, changed with
   increasing grain size although we did not obtain a monotonic behavior of
   the variance explained by the multivariate model. Including the
   assessment of scale dependence in the monitoring project appears useful
   and necessary to correctly evaluate the effects of restoration actions
   in a consistent way.}},

Abstract = {{Uncontrolled cattle grazing is frequent in protected areas across the

   known. We used generalized additive models to examine the precise
   relationships between cattle grazing intensity, vegetation structure,

   North West Biosphere Reserve, Peru. Cattle grazing was widespread and
   intensity was negatively correlated with average canopy height and
   percentage of vegetation cover at 5-15 m. Raptors were influenced by
   cattle density but they were probably more strongly influenced by canopy
   and sub-canopy characteristics. Raptor species responded differently to
   increasing cattle density: presence of species that hunted or searched
   for food in open habitats increased with cattle density, while presence
   of range restricted species that hunted from perches, and declining
   species decreased. Moderate cattle densities (20-60 cows km(-2)) may
   actually benefit some raptor species and help to maintain the high
   raptor diversity in the study area. Reserve authorities should, however,
   act to reduce cattle densities in some areas, which can exceed 120 cows
   km(-2), that seriously affect some key raptor species, and cause forest
   to be converted to permanent cattle pasture.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the diversity of dung beetle communities in Japanese pastures
   to identify the factors that maintain or enhance the diversity of dung
   beetles at a landscape scale. We surveyed dung beetles from 17 pastures
   located in the northeastern part of Tochigi Prefecture, which is in the
   center of mainland Japan. From 1999 to 2001, surveys were conducted
   during the 6-month grazing period (May to October) by using dung baited
   basket traps. We also collected information about the environmental
   conditions and pasture management practices. Twenty-five dung beetle
   species belonging to Geotrupinae, Scarabaeinae, and Aphodiinae
   (including 13 tunneler and 12 dweller species) were recorded. The
   abundance of dweller species decreased with increasing elevation,
   possibly because of the effect of rainfall, whereas the species richness
   of tunneler species was affected by cattle disturbance and soil
   condition. Beetle species richness significantly increased with the
   number of years that the pastures had been grazed. Ivermectin
   administration did not appear to have any adverse effect on dung beetle
   abundance, species richness, or species diversity. The dung beetle
   datasets of the current study (including specific tunneler and dweller
   beetle groups) supported the widely documented positive relationship
   between local abundance and species distribution ranges. The within
   pasture, within area, and between area hierarchical additive
   partitioning of regional total diversity indicated that landscape-scale
   management should be implemented to conserve the regional diversity of
   the dung beetle communities inhabiting Japanese pastures.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands recovered by sowing low diversity seed mixtures of local
   provenance are usually managed by mowing. Besides restoration success
   only a few studies have focused on the direct effects of
   post-restoration mowing on recovered grassland vegetation. In this study
   we followed vegetation changes in 13 successfully recovered grasslands
   in 5 x 5-m-sized sites with continuous and ceased mowing at Hortobagy
   National Park, East-Hungary. We asked the following questions: (i) What
   are the effects of cessation of mowing on the vegetation structure and
   diversity of recovered grasslands? (ii) What are the effects of
   cessation of mowing on the abundance of sown grasses, target and
   undesirable species? (iii) Is yearly mowing an appropriate management
   tool for the maintenance of recovered grasslands? Our results showed
   that the cessation of mowing caused litter accumulation, while
   diversity, total vegetation cover and the cover of sown grasses
   decreased compared to the mown sites. The cover of undesirable perennial
   species was significantly higher in unmown sites than in mown ones. The
   species composition of mown sites remained more similar to near-natural
   grasslands than the unmown ones. Our results suggest that without
   regular post-restoration mowing the favourable status of recovered
   grasslands can rapidly decline due to litter accumulation and by the
   expansion of undesirable species, even in the short-run. We also stress
   that while yearly mowing is enough to maintain grasslands recovered by
   low-diversity seed sowing, it cannot be considered to be enough to
   recover target vegetation composition.}},

Abstract = {{Oribatid mites may be of epidemiological and medical importance because
   several species have been shown to serve as intermediate hosts for
   anoplocephalid tapeworms of wild and domestic animals. Despite their
   economic and conservation significance, relatively few studies examined
   factors influencing the effective number of oribatid mites that can
   serve as intermediate hosts. We examined variation in the structure of
   the edaphic arthropod community in functionally different territory
   parts of the Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota latirostris), a known
   definitive host of a prevalent anoplocephalid tapeworm, Ctenotaenia
   marmotae. We used a field experiment to test whether the abundance of
   oribatid mites in marmot pastures is affected by the presence of fresh
   herbivore faeces. We found that the abundance of soil and litter
   dwelling oribatid mites in marmot pastures did not change shortly after
   faeces addition. In contrast, numbers of other predominant soil-litter
   and phoretic microarthropods increased after faeces addition. The
   abundance of the two predominant phoretic mites colonizing the faeces
   was inversely related to the abundance of oribatid mites. In contrast,
   the abundance of a ubiquitous soil-litter mesostigmatid mite was a
   positive function of oribatid numbers. Although absolute numbers of
   oribatid mites did not change after faeces addition, our study suggests
   that, depending on soil quality or type, the probability of tapeworm egg
   ingestion by oribatid mites can be reduced due to increased
   interspecific prey-predatory and trophic interactions. Latrine site
   selection in Alpine marmots is consistent with a reduced probability of
   tapeworm transmission by oribatids.}},

Title = {{A decision framework for management of conflicting production and
   biodiversity goals for a commercially valuable invasive species}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{1-11}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The management of introduced species that are both invasive and
   commercially valuable is contentious. While such species provide
   substantial economic benefits to some, they pose considerable costs to
   others due to negative impacts on ecosystems. We propose a decision
   framework to help balance conflicting objectives and support the
   management of commercially valuable invasive species. We illustrate our
   framework using the buffel grass (Pennisetum ciliare syn. Cenchrus
   ciliaris L.) invasion in Australia. In rangelands worldwide, buffet
   grass is amongst a suite of commercially valuable invasive species,
   highly valued by some graziers as a pasture species but widely unpopular
   among those concerned with the threat it poses for native biodiversity.
   The framework comprises four components. First we develop a state and
   transition model to represent the invasion dynamics of buffel grass and
   the effect of management actions. Second we construct utility functions
   to represent the relative values of buffel grass cover in terms of
   production and biodiversity utilities (indicative of grazier's and
   conservationist's relative `happiness' regarding buffel grass cover). We
   draw on expert and empirical data for the construction of the model and
   utility functions. Third, we present management strategies that minimize
   losses in production and biodiversity utilities in the absence of budget
   constraints. We use stochastic dynamic programming and multi-criteria
   decision analysis which explicitly account for trade-offs between
   production and biodiversity conservation concerns. Finally, we conduct a
   sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumptions of the model
   and utility functions. Management complexity arises from
   biodiversity-production trade-off situations in which the desirable
   state of buffel grass cover and effective actions to achieve this state
   depend on the utility functions. Management solutions were particularly
   sensitive to the shape of the utility functions for biodiversity.
   Solutions were less sensitive to uncertainty surrounding the
   effectiveness of management actions. We found in most
   biodiversity-production tradeoff situations a compromise solution led to
   management for an intermediate level (>0-50\%) of buffel grass cover.
   However, when maximal values for both biodiversity and production are
   high, it may be more practical to manage for one value rather than find
   a compromise solution where concessions from both sides are high. Our
   decision framework does not attempt to optimize economic outcomes but
   provides a guide for formulating trade-offs between opposing views,
   something that is relevant to the management of any natural resource
   management problem where there are conflicting objectives. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The importance of spatial patterns for ecosystem functioning and
   biodiversity has long been recognized in ecology. Grazing by herbivores
   is an important mechanism leading to spatial patterns in the vegetation
   structure. How different herbivore species and their densities affect
   vegetation-structure patchiness is, however, poorly understood, and very
   few studies have simultaneously incorporated the underlying abiotic
   patterns. We investigated how different herbivore species and densities
   affect vegetation-structure patchiness. We conducted an experiment in a
   semi-natural grassland using horses and cattle in two densities each
   (0.5 LU/ha and 1.0 LU/ha). Transects of 25 m in length were positioned
   within the study salt marsh, and canopy and canopy height and soil
   elevation were measured every 25 cm to explore patterns in canopy
   height. Geostatistical variogram models were fitted to all transects
   with the elevation as a covariable to correct for the underlying abiotic
   patterns. The range (as a measure for patch size of short or tall
   canopy) and sill (as a measure for heterogeneity) of the variogram model
   were compared between horses and cattle and between two densities.
   Canopy height was lower in horse-grazed compared to cattle-grazed
   treatments and lower in higher herbivore densities. Patch size (range)
   (tall and short canopy) was significantly larger in horse-grazed
   treatments, and a trend of larger patch size was found for higher
   densities with both herbivore species. While herbivore species had no
   clear effect on heterogeneity, a trend of a higher heterogeneity (sill)
   was found in low densities. We found that the two herbivore species and
   densities have differential effects on canopy height, patch size and
   heterogeneity. Although some of these results were only found as trends,
   our study has important implications for conservation management of
   grazed salt marshes. To form heterogeneous small-scaled vegetation
   patterns we would generally recommend applying grazing with (1) cattle
   rather than horses, and (2) at low rather than high densities. We
   further discuss the relevance of our findings for other grazed
   ecosystems. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Habitat selection of brood-rearing Northern Wheatears Oenanthe oenanthe
   and their invertebrate prey}},

Pages = {{61-69}},

Abstract = {{Birds consider both variation in prey abundance and accessibility in
   their decision of where to forage. Acidification and nitrogen deposition
   affect both prey abundance and accessibility by stimulating growth of
   nitrophilic grasses at the expense of forbs. Management practises such
   as mowing or grazing primarily affect vegetation structure which also
   influences the abundance and accessibility of invertebrates. Hence, for
   effective management and conservation purposes it is paramount to
   understand the relationships between vegetation structure, densities of
   preferred prey and habitat-use of birds. In this study we explore such
   relationships for the nationally endangered Northern Wheatear Oenanthe
   oenanthe in dune grasslands along the Dutch coast. Our findings support
   the hypothesis that forager mobility and food accessibility are of
   greater importance during patch selection than food abundance per se in
   ground foraging birds. The abundance of all potential prey and three of
   the four most important actual prey groups was highest in tall grass,
   but Northern Wheatears foraged preferentially in short grass. Clearly,
   encroachment by tall grass will diminish habitat suitability for
   Northern Wheatears due to lowered prey accessibility. We propose that a
   mixture of short and tall vegetation and landscape management allows for
   dispersal of arthropods between different (micro)habitats. We provide
   densities of the important prey in a coastal area where Northern
   Wheatears still successfully breed. This enables site-managers to
   efficiently investigate presence and abundance of important prey in
   seemingly suitable areas but where Northern Wheatears do not breed.
   Eventually we may be able to discern whether food shortage poses a
   bottleneck for Northern Wheatears in these uninhabited areas.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in plant diversity have consequences for higher trophic levels,
   e.g., higher plant diversity can enhance the reproduction and fitness of
   plant-associated insects. This response of higher trophic levels
   potentially depends on diversity-related changes in both resource
   quantity (abundance) and quality (nutritional content). The availability
   of elemental nutrients in plant resources is one aspect of nutritional
   quality, hut has rarely been addressed as a pathway relating plant
   diversity to associated insects. Using the experimental plant diversity
   gradient of a large biodiversity grassland project, the Jena-Experiment,
   we analysed the \%C, \%N and \%P and the molar ratios of those elements
   (C:N, C:P and N:P) in a pollinating bee, Chelostoma distinctum, and an
   herbivorous grasshopper, Chorthippus parallelus, reared on plots of
   different plant diversity. Insects showed higher content of C. N and P
   (\% dry mass), and lower C:N and C:P ratios than plants. C:N ratios were
   significantly higher in grasshoppers than in bees and higher in females
   than in males of both species. Increasing plant species richness
   increased the C:N ratio of male bees and female grasshoppers. In both
   groups, stoichiometry was positively related to plant stoichiometry
   (male bees: C:P and N:J); grasshoppers: C:N and N:P). Path analysis
   revealed that diversity-driven changes in plant elemental composition
   can have consequences for abundance and chemical composition of higher
   trophic levels, with different responses of the two functional groups.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Grazing exclusion is an effective way to restore the degraded grassland,
   and significantly influences the vegetation compositions and soil
   properties. Plant-soil interaction plays an important role in the
   maintenance of both plant community composition and soil properties.
   However, there is littler information on the changes and feedback plant
   community and soil properties in the semiarid grassland on the time
   series of the long-term scale that has been continuous grazing exclusion
   grassland for thirty years. Using the monitoring data of five reference
   years from 1982 to 2011, we studied the effects of long-term grazing
   exclusion on plant community and soil properties, the grazing management
   treatment was as the control. Our results showed that the coverage,
   plant density, species richness above- and belowground biomass, and
   Shannon-Wiener index are higher in the mid- and transitional stage of
   succession in arid and semiarid grassland and then decreased with
   increasing restoration time. The plant density, coverage and aboveground
   biomass of plant functional groups showed similar results. Soil organic
   matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), available potassium (AK), available
   phosphorus (AP), and available nitrogen (AN) significantly increased
   with the increase of restoration time. There was an interaction between
   coverage, species richness, total productivity and some soil properties.
   For plant functional groups, only perennial bunchgrasses was significant
   positively related to SOM, TN, AN, and AK. This implies that perennial
   bunchgrasses may be an indicator of soil properties and improve soil
   nutrient. Our studies provide new sights into the plant-soil
   interactions and grassland management in semiarid region. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Plant communities and their ecosystem functions are expected to be more
   resilient to future habitat fragmentation and deterioration if the
   species comprising the communities have a wide range of dispersal and
   persistence strategies. However, the extent to which the diversity of
   dispersal and persistence traits in plant communities is determined by
   the current and historical characteristics of sites and their
   surrounding landscape has yet to be explored. Using quantitative
   information on long-distance seed dispersal potential by wind and
   animals (dispersal in space) and on species' persistence/longevity
   (dispersal in time), we (i) compared levels of dispersal and persistence
   trait diversity (functional richness, FRic, and functional divergence,
   FDiv) in seminatural grassland plant communities with those expected by
   chance, and (ii) quantified the extent to which trait diversity was
   explained by current and historical landscape structure and local
   management history - taking into account spatial and phylogenetic
   autocorrel. Null model analysis revealed that more grassland communities
   than expected had a level of trait diversity that was lower or higher
   than predicted, given the level of species richness. Both the range
   (FRic) and divergence (FDiv) of dispersal and persistence trait values
   increased with grassland age. FDiv was mainly explained by the
   interaction between current grazing intensity and the amount of
   grassland habitat in the surrounding landscape in 1938.Synthesis. The
   study suggests that the variability of dispersal and persistence traits
   in grassland plant communities is driven by deterministic assembly
   processes, with both history and current management (and their
   interactions), playing a major role as determinants of trait diversity.
   While a long continuity of grazing management is likely to have promoted
   the diversity of dispersal and persistence traits in present-day
   grasslands, communities in sites that are well grazed at the present
   day, and were also surrounded by large amounts of grassland in the past,
   showed the highest diversity of dispersal and persistence strategies.
   Our results indicate that the historical context of a site within a
   landscape will influence the extent to which current grazing management
   is able to maintain a diversity of dispersal and persistence strategies
   and buffer communities (and their associated functions) against
   continuing habitat fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional landscape elements such as pasture patches enclosed in a
   forest matrix are progressively disappearing throughout the European
   Alps. We assessed the land mosaic shift of a protected area located in
   the western Italian Alps. In particular, the dynamics of pasture patches
   were studied at both landscape and stand level. Land-cover mapping
   through object-oriented analysis of historical aerial photographs was
   used to assess land-cover changes between 1954 and 2000. Spatial
   statistics were used to quantify landscape patterns, and field samplings
   within pasture patches were used to explore tree regeneration structure
   and composition. Our results showed a significant increase in the number
   of pasture patches caused by their fragmentation following forest
   expansion. The total surface area of pasture patches decreased by 43\%
   and their core area decreased by 94\%. The encroachment of trees on less
   accessible areas of the pasture patches caused a reduction of patch
   shape at landscape scale. The gap filling process started 40-50 years
   ago and began with an early invasion of light demanding species like
   sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) and common ash (Fraxinus
   excelsior L.), followed by European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) and
   secondarily silver fir (Abies alba Mill.). Traditional land-use and
   population decline in the Pesio Valley led to a reduction in ecotone
   areas. A transition to a more homogeneous landscape is expected in the
   next decades. Given the cultural and productive nature of these mountain
   meadow-pasture communities, extensive livestock grazing systems could be
   used to manage their future conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Current biodiversity conservation policies have so far had limited
   success because they are mainly targeted to the scale of individual
   fields with little concern on different responses of organism groups at
   larger spatial scales. We investigated the relative impacts of
   multi-scale factors, including local land use intensity, landscape
   context and region, on functional groups of beetles (Coleoptera). In
   2008, beetles were suction-sampled from 95 managed grasslands in three
   regions, ranging from Southern to Northern Germany. The results showed
   that region was the most important factor affecting the abundance of
   herbivores and the abundance and species composition of predators and
   decomposers. Herbivores were not affected by landscape context and land
   use intensity. The species composition of the predator communities
   changed with land use intensity, but only in interaction with landscape
   context. Interestingly, decomposer abundance was negatively related to
   land use intensity in low-diversity landscapes, whereas in
   high-diversity landscapes the relation was positive, possibly due to
   enhanced spillover effects in complex landscapes. We conclude that (i)
   management at multiple scales, from local sites to landscapes and
   regions, is essential for managing biodiversity, (ii) beetle predators
   and decomposers are more affected than herbivores, supporting the
   hypothesis that higher trophic levels are more sensitive to
   environmental change, and (iii) sustaining biological control and
   decomposition services in managed grassland needs a diverse landscape,
   while effects of local land use intensity may depend on landscape
   context.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of sustainable intensification has recently been developed
   to raise productivity (as distinct from increasing volume of production)
   while reducing environmental impacts. This means increasing yields per
   unit of inputs (including nutrients, water, energy capital and land) as
   well as per unit of undesirable outputs (such as greenhouse gas
   emissions, water pollution or loss of biodiversity). It is thus helpful
   to understand intensification' as referring to environmental factor
   productivity' or eco-efficiency'. Worldwide, grassland is the most
   important agroecosystem delivering ecosystem services ranging from feed
   supply for ruminants and soil carbon storage to habitats of
   biodiversity. However, worldwide, grassland is under threat due to
   intensified land use and land-use changes from grass to arable. In this
   article, we (i) highlight ecosystem services of selected grassland
   biomes abroad of Europe, (ii) show evidence of sustainable as well as
   non-sustainable intensification options in these grassland biomes linked
   to European agriculture by exports of agricultural commodities (e.g.
   soy) and (iii) derive research strategies for north-west European
   grassland research and management to match sustainable intensification
   strategies for the grassland-based dairy industry.}},

Abstract = {{The relative importance of breed versus rearing experience on the
   grazing behaviour and diet selection of beef cattle when grazing
   unimproved grassland was examined over 4 years. Suckler-reared calves of
   a traditional (T) breed (North Devon) or a commercial (C) breed
   (Simmental x Hereford Friesian) were cross-fostered and then reared
   either extensively (E) on unimproved grassland or intensively (I) on
   agriculturally improved fertilized grassland. As yearlings, the four
   groups of calves (Traditional breed + Extensive rearing (TE);
   Traditional breed + Intensive rearing (TI); Commercial breed + Extensive
   rearing (CE) and Commercial breed + Intensive rearing (CI)) grazed
   unimproved grassland dominated by Molinia caerulea, for 2 months, and
   foraging behaviour was studied in a test phase. There was a breed effect
   on total (bites + chews; TJM) jaw movement rate (T, 78.2 vs. C, 76.5
   min(-1); F prob.=0.041) during grazing and on the proportion of bites
   taken from plant communities with sward height >= 6cm (T, 0.83 vs. C,
   0.76; F prob.=0.018). Rearing experience affected TJM rate in the first
   year in July (E, 80.0 vs. I, 76.8min(-1); F prob.=0.015) and August (E,
   78.5 vs. I, 75.5min(-1); F prob.=0.046). The intensively reared animals

   previous experience of the unimproved grassland as calves with their
   mothers (E, 0.16 vs. I, 0.09kg day(-1); F prob.=0.033). Our findings
   indicate that the rearing experience of livestock appears to be as
   important as the breed when designing grazing managements for nature

Abstract = {{Populations of migratory geese overwintering in Europe have risen
   rapidly during recent decades, leading to increased pressure on
   available forage resources and more grazing on agricultural lands.
   Farmers throughout Europe have complained of yield losses due to goose
   grazing. In spring, the Svalbard-breeding population of pink-footed
   goose (Anser brachyrhynchus) migrates through specific staging sites in
   Norway, where the geese graze on dairy grasslands and other types of
   agricultural lands in the early growing season. Despite this, little is
   known of the impacts of goose grazing on hay biomass and quality in
   Norway. An experiment using exclosures to prevent goose grazing, and
   plots that were open for grazing, was established in Central Norway to
   test the effects of variable grazing intensity on dairy grassland
   yields. A single spring-grazing event had severe negative impact at the
   site with the highest grazing intensity, leading to a 25\% reduction in
   forage yield (milk feed units per hectare) as compared to ungrazed
   areas. The impacts on the sites with lower grazing intensity were more
   subtle. The overall reduction (across all sites) of biomass yield was
   26\%. Forage quality, in terms of milk feed units per kg, was not much
   affected. Grazing increased the proportion and diversity of weeds, as
   evidenced by a 49\% increase of the Shannon biodiversity index, and
   there was a 1.3\% decrease in the proportion of herbage biomass of sown
   species. Hence, we have confirmed farmer reports on yield losses,
   gaining an increased understanding of the overall farmer costs
   associated with goose grazing in this northern latitude region.}},

Title = {{Mixed Grazing Systems Benefit both Upland Biodiversity and Livestock
   Production}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: With world food demand expected to double by 2050,
   identifying farming systems that benefit both agricultural production
   and biodiversity is a fundamentally important challenge for the 21st
   century, but this has to be achieved in a sustainable way. Livestock
   grazing management directly influences both economic outputs and
   biodiversity on upland farms while contributing to potentially damaging
   greenhouse gas emissions, yet no study has attempted to address these
   impacts simultaneously.
   Methods: Using a replicated, landscape-scale field experiment consisting
   of five management `systems' we tested the effects of progressively
   altering elements within an upland farming system, viz i) incorporating
   cattle grazing into an upland sheep system, ii) integrating grazing of
   semi-natural rough grazing into a mixed grazing system based on improved
   pasture, iii) altering the stocking ratio within a mixed grazing system,
   and iv) replacing modern crossbred cattle with a traditional breed. We
   quantified the impacts on livestock productivity and numbers of birds
   and butterflies over four years.
   Results, Conclusion and Significance: We found that management systems
   incorporating mixed grazing with cattle improve livestock productivity
   and reduce methane emissions relative to sheep only systems. Systems
   that also included semi-natural rough grazing consistently supported
   more species of birds and butterflies, and it was possible to
   incorporate bouts of summer grazing of these pastures by cattle to meet
   habitat management prescriptions without compromising cattle performance
   overall. We found no evidence that the system incorporating a cattle
   breed popular as a conservation grazer was any better for bird and
   butterfly species richness than those based on a mainstream breed, yet
   methane emissions from such a system were predicted to be higher. We
   have demonstrated that mixed upland grazing systems not only improve
   livestock production, but also benefit biodiversity, suggesting a
   `win-win' solution for farmers and conservationists.}},

Abstract = {{High mountain environments located in the tropics account for as much as
   10 \% of the total surface area of high mountain ecosystems worldwide,
   yet their ecology has been studied much less thoroughly than outside the
   tropics. The dry Puna is the largest ecosystem of the high tropical
   Andes and one of the leading biodiversity hotspots worldwide. In this
   high mountain environment, the main stress factors are the long period
   of water shortage, high degree of potential evapotranspiration, wind
   erosion, low soil nutrient content, and extreme thermal variation. The
   aim of this study was to deepen our understanding of the relation
   between the dry Puna species composition and diversity, and
   environmental/anthropogenic variables. Species cover was determined and
   soil samples were analysed from 121 plots, along altitudinal transects
   located between 3,900 and 4,900 m a.s.l. in South Peru. The data were
   statistically analysed by means of Multivariate regression tree
   analysis, Indicator Species analysis and Redundancy analysis. The
   hypothesis that in the dry Puna, altitudinal gradient, aspect and
   rockiness are key factors that mainly determine the floristic
   composition of the vegetation was confirmed. The local soil features
   emerged as a secondary driver in the plant community composition.
   Moreover, disturbance intensity appeared to be a main factor in
   determining changes in the plant community diversity, also modifying the
   site ecology (nutrient content, pH) and the structure of ecosystems
   (from grass dominated systems to dwarf shrub-dominated communities).
   High grazing intensities caused the spread of species with avoidance
   strategies such as thorny dwarf shrubs (Tetraglochin cristaturn), annual
   and prostrate plants. Harsh conditions (thin and coarse soil, severe
   solar radiation, low temperatures and thermal fluctuations) promoted the
   spread of cushion plants (Pycnophyllurn sp. pl.), while aspect and soil
   features (pH, silt \% and potassium content) shaped the species
   composition of Festuca orthophylla tall grassland, the dominant plant
   community in the dry Puna.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing systems that combine grasslands and woodlands represent changes
   in tree cover that influences herbaceous vegetation and may threaten the
   native forest flora. We studied these influences in Chilean Patagonia
   where recent colonization resulted in the fragmentation of the lenga
   (Nothofagus pumilio) forests leading to a mosaic-type landscape. The
   herbaceous vegetation, transmitted photosynthetically active radiation
   (PAR) and other forest structure characteristics were sampled in 15 (20
   m x 20 m) plots differing in tree cover for two years, while considering
   the relative position (below or beyond) of tree crowns. Herbaceous
   species were classified as forest, non-forest, and forest indifferent
   species according to their preference, rejection or indifference to the
   forest environment. Species richness decreased with increasing PAR but
   this was dependent on the response of non-natives. Species composition
   varied gradually from open grasslands to dense forests, according to
   transmitted PAR values. Native species were associated to either forests
   or open areas, but the number of native species did not vary along the
   tree cover gradient (beyond tree crowns) or even decreased (below tree
   crowns). Non-native species dominated in the open grasslands and beyond
   tree crowns and its richness increased with transmitted PAR. The
   occurrence of grasslands and dense forests within this grazing system is
   shown to promote higher species richness. Management will consider that
   dense forest patches are necessary for maintaining a high diversity of
   native species, since isolated trees or low wooded areas do not
   guarantee the persistence of all native species associated to the
   original forests. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Steinach Grassland Experiment (SGE) is probably the oldest
   still-running grassland fertilizer experiment in Continental Europe. It
   was established on an alluvial Alopecurus pratensis meadow in southeast
   Germany in 1933. The aim of this study was to provide detailed
   information on this experiment concerning the effects of decades-long
   nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium application (46 treatments
   in total) on (1) soil chemical properties, (2) sward height, (3) plant
   species composition, and (4) species richness of vascular plants derived
   from a field survey in spring 2008.
   (1) A steep gradient of soil properties was recorded, namely
   plant-available (Mehlich III) P (14-161 mg kg(-1)), K (82-1018 mg
   kg(-1)) and Ca (532-3336 mg kg(-1)) concentrations, C:N ratio (6.9-10.4)
   and pH (H2O) (4.7-7.0).
   (2) Compressed sward height in the third week of May 2008 ranged from 11
   cm in the control to 47 cm in the limed plot with high N, P, and K
   application.
   (3) Although fertilizer application altered the plant species
   composition, diversification of plant communities was not as high as in
   the case of fertilizer application on low productive soils in other
   experiments. This was caused by sufficient nutrients enabling the
   survival of species adapted to high nutrient availability, even in the
   unfertilized control. The species composition in productive alluvial
   grasslands is substantially less affected by fertilizer application than
   in low productive grasslands.
   (4) Long-term fertilizer application negatively affected the species
   richness of vascular plants directly by soil acidification and
   indirectly by an increase in sward height. The extent to which N
   application negatively affected species richness was dependent on
   whether N was applied alone or in combination with other nutrients and
   whether N application acidified the soil. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Succession has a strong influence on species diversity and composition
   of semi-natural open terrestrial ecosystems. While several studies
   examined the effects of succession on butterflies in grassland and
   forest ecosystems, the response of heathland butterflies to succession
   had not been investigated so far. To address this issue we sampled
   butterfly abundance and environmental parameters on the Baltic island of
   Hiddensee (NE Germany) along a gradient of coastal heathland succession
   from grey dunes to birch forest. Our results provide evidence that
   succession of coastal heathland has a strong influence on butterfly
   diversity, abundance, and species composition. Thereby grass and tree
   encroachment present the main threats for heathland butterflies.
   Diversity and abundance of butterflies were highest in shrub-encroached
   heath directly followed by early stages of coastal heathland succession
   (dwarf-shrub heath, grey dune). Both observed threatened species
   (Hipparchia semele, Plebeius argus) were negatively affected by
   succession: abundance decreased with increasing vegetation density (both
   species) and grass cover (P. argus); consequently, the two later
   successional stages (shrub, birch forest) were not occupied. Our
   findings highlight the importance of the preservation of early stages of
   coastal heathland succession for endangered butterfly species. For
   coastal heathland management we therefore suggest to maintain early
   successional stages by sheep grazing, mowing or, in case of high
   nutrient contents, intensive techniques such as sod-cutting or
   choppering. To a lower extend shrub-encroached sites should also be
   present, which might be beneficial for overall species richness.}},

Abstract = {{Year-round grazing with robust cattle is increasingly used as a
   near-natural tool for the restoration of structurally diverse grassland
   ecosystems in Western and Central Europe. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the general success of year-round grazing and to analyze the
   interplay between emerging vegetation structures, grazing patterns and
   abiotic environmental conditions. In summer 2010 vegetation composition,
   aboveground biomass and soil properties were sampled at 44 quadrats of 4
   x 4 m(2) within two year-round grazed floodplain sites in Northwestern
   Germany. For plot selection, we predefined structural vegetation types
   and later statistically determined indicative plant species for each
   structural type. Our results showed that year-round grazing resulted in
   the successful creation of eutrophic grassland communities on former
   agricultural land after 15 years. Soil parameters like phosphorous and
   potassium concentration and the flooding duration did not or only
   slightly differ between different structure types. In summer, cattle
   preferably fed at short-growing patches which were of better digestible
   biomass than taller patches. Hence, our data clearly demonstrate a
   positive feedback between grazing intensity and fodder quality leading
   to a patchy vegetation structure of intensively grazed swards and less
   frequented areas dominated by high-growing grasses and tall forbs,
   almost independently from primary differences in soil parameters and
   other site factors such as flooding duration. The remarkable structural
   and floristic diversity of year-round grazing systems clearly is a
   result of these spatially contrasting feeding patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous observational studies have documented conspecific negative

   recruitment in areas of higher host density or lower relative
   phylogenetic diversity. Using spatially randomized plots of high and low
   host biomass in a temperate grassland biodiversity experiment, we
   treated developing seedheads of six prairie perennials to factorial
   applications of fungicide and insecticide. We measured predispersal seed
   production, seed viability, and seedling biomass. Results were highly
   species-specific and idiosyncratic. Effects of insect seed predators and
   fungal pathogens on predispersal responses varied with neither
   conspecific biomass nor phylogenetic diversity, suggesting that-at least
   at the predispersal stage and for the insect and fungal seed predators
   we were able to exclude-the JCH is not sufficient to contribute to
   negative conspecific density-dependence for these dominant prairie
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing may negatively impact bird nesting in wetland
   habitats. This study evaluated the effect of grazing on the nests of the
   Oriental pratincole (Glareola maldivarum) along the grassland of a
   wetland at six study sites with different densities of grazing cattle
   and buffalo. Species richness, density, cover, and height of vegetation
   in the study areas were different (P < 0.05). The density of cattle and
   buffalo at the various sites affected vegetation composition and amount,
   which in turn influenced bird nest density. The estimated trampling
   rates, number of fledglings, and number of trampled eggs were different
   among study sites (P < 0.05). The density of cattle and buffalo has an
   influence on nest failure rates. The factors that influenced the
   mortality rates of the Oriental pratincole were trampling and unhatched
   eggs. Only 48.5\% of the nests were successful at sites where cattle and
   buffalo continuously grazed in the grasslands at high densities. Thus,
   increases in the density of cattle and buffalo will reduce the number of
   nests of the Oriental pratincole, which may result in a reduction of the

Abstract = {{Proper grazing management practices can generate corresponding

   from 2004 to 2012. Peak standing crop decreased (P < 0.05) with
   increasing stocking rate; peak standing crop in the HG treatment
   decreased 40 \% compared to the control. May-July precipitation
   explained at least 76 \% of the variation in peak standing crop. MG and
   HG treatments resulted in a decrease (P < 0.05) in shrubs, semi-shrubs,
   and perennials forbs, and an increase (P < 0.05) in perennial
   bunchgrasses compared to the control. The coefficients of variation at
   plant functional group and species level in the LG and MG treatments
   were lower (P < 0.05) than in the control and HG treatments. Peak
   standing crop variability of the control and HG community were greatest,
   which suggested that LG and MG have greater ecosystem stability.}},

Abstract = {{Alpine and subalpine ecosystems support many endemic species. These
   ecosystems are increasingly under threat from human-induced disturbances
   such as habitat loss and fragmentation as a consequence of ski resort
   development and expansion. However, limited peer-reviewed research has
   investigated the impacts of ski-related disturbances on wildlife,
   particularly on reptiles. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted
   reptile surveys to determine the patterns of reptile distribution and
   abundance in Australian ski resorts. Then, using a factorial
   experimental design, we investigated 1) the influence of temperature and
   predation in driving observed distributions and 2) how a common ski
   resort management practice - mowing of modified ski slopes - affected
   thermal regimes and rates of predation of reptiles on ski runs. We found
   that the removal of vegetation structural complexity through mowing
   resulted in significantly higher rates of predation on plasticine
   models, as well as significantly altered thermal regimes. Crucially,
   mown ski runs had higher maximum ground temperatures that frequently
   exceeded the recorded critical maximum body temperatures of the target
   species of lizards. Thus, mowing has the potential to render these areas
   unsuitable for thermoregulatory purposes for a large proportion of the
   potential activity period of reptiles. Together, modifications of the
   thermal environment and elevated rates of predation appear to explain
   the avoidance of ski runs by reptiles. To facilitate the persistence of
   reptiles in disturbed subalpine environments, management plans must
   focus on implementing strategies that reduce the impact of human
   activities that alter temperature regimes and predation rates on
   lizards.Synthesis and Applications. We suggest that the retention of
   structural complexity on ski runs (e.g. through the cessation of mowing
   during peak reptile activity periods) and/or revegetation with native
   plant communities will concurrently provide refuge from predators and
   buffer against extreme temperatures, making ski runs more hospitable to
   reptiles. Based on our findings, we emphasize that effective management
   strategies targeting subalpine biodiversity conservation require an
   understanding of the drivers that determine species distributions in
   these landscapes.

Title = {{Ecologically sustainable fertility management for the maintenance of
   species-rich hay meadows: a 12-year fertilizer and lime experiment}},

Volume = {{51}},

Abstract = {{Increased use of artificial fertilizers has caused widespread loss of
   species-rich grasslands throughout Britain and mainland Europe.
   Species-rich meadows are traditionally managed by hay cutting, use of
   farmyard manure (FYM) and occasional liming, but sustainable fertility
   management to maintain their botanical diversity is ill defined. This
   study measured vegetation responses to fertilizers and lime applied over
   12years to species-rich upland and lowland mesotrophic hay meadows in
   the UK. Treatments consisted of three rates of FYM applied annually or
   triennially, inorganic fertilizers giving equivalent amounts of N, P and
   K to two of the annual and two of the triennial FYM treatments, and lime
   applied either alone or with annual or triennial FYM. Farmyard manure at
   24tonnesha(-1)year(-1) reduced total species richness and the richness
   of positive indicator species at both meadows and increased aggregate
   cover of negative indicator species. Lower rates of FYM application were
   also detrimental at the lowland meadow, but not at the upland one.
   Inorganic fertilizers were no more damaging to plant species richness
   than equivalent FYM treatments. At the upland meadow, vegetation quality
   was maintained by continuing past FYM inputs (12tha(-1)year(-1)), but
   improved at lower rates. At the lowland meadow, which has no recent
   history of fertilizer use, rates equivalent to only 4tonnes FYM
   ha(-1)year(-1) were sustainable. Evidence was slight of vegetation
   adapting to increased inputs at either meadow. Between-meadow
   differences in vulnerability to treatments apparently reflected
   differences in site-specific factors, particularly past management,
   rather than differences in plant community type.Synthesis and
   applications. Relatively modest fertility inputs can reduce the
   ecological value of meadows with no recent history of such inputs,
   whereas moderate inputs of fertilizer and lime will be ecologically
   sustainable in meadows adapted to a long history of application.
   Decisions on sustainable levels of fertilizer use to maintain or enhance
   botanical diversity of grassland should be based on knowledge of soil
   physical and chemical status and past fertility management. Inorganic
   fertilizers are no more damaging than farmyard manure when applied at
   equivalent amounts of N, P and K.

Title = {{Multiple nutrients and herbivores interact to govern diversity,

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{123}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{214-224}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In spite of increasing awareness that interactions between herbivory and
   the supply rates of multiple nutrients control biodiversity, ecosystem
   functions and ecosystem services in ecological communities, few
   experimental studies have concurrently examined the independent and
   joint effects of multiple nutrients and mammalian consumers on these
   responses in natural systems. Here we quantify the independent and
   interactive effects of multiple concurrent changes to resources and
   consumers in an invaded annual grassland community in California. In a
   two-year study using thirty-seven 400-m(2) plots, we examine
   interactions among four nutrient treatments (N, P, K and micronutrients)
   and a keystone herbivore (pocket gopher Thomomys bottae) on four plant
   community outcomes: 1) plant diversity, 2) functional group composition,
   3) net biomass production, an important ecosystem function, and 4)
   infection risk by a group of viral pathogens shared by crop and non-crop
   grasses (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses), an important
   regulating ecosystem service. We found that grassland biodiversity and
   infection risk were controlled by nutrient identity and supply ratio
   whereas nutrients interacted strongly with consumers to control
   grassland composition and net primary productivity. The most important
   insights arising from this multi-factor experiment are that net biomass
   production increased with phosphorus or nitrogen supply; however, when
   gophers were present, nitrogen caused no net effect on biomass
   production. In addition, infection risk was driven by phosphorus,
   nitrogen and micronutrient supply. Infection in a sentinel host
   increased strongly with the addition of micronutrients or phosphorus;
   however, infection declined with increasing N/P supply ratio, indicating
   stoichiometric control of infection risk. Finally, in spite of
   manipulating multiple factors, plant species richness declined with
   nitrogen, alone. The importance of higher-order interactions
   demonstrates that a multi-factor approach is critical for effective
   predictions in a world in which anthropogenic activities are
   simultaneously changing herbivore abundance and the relative supply of
   many nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{East-central European semi-dry grasslands hold several world records in
   small-scale vascular plant species richness. However, the reasons for
   the peculiarity of these grasslands are not well known, which hinders a
   better understanding of the mechanisms of species coexistence. We
   suggest that one of the reasons for this gap in our knowledge is the
   lack of basic information on the geographical distribution of these
   grasslands, their species richness, species composition and site
   conditions. Here we report new sites of extremely species-rich semi-dry
   grasslands in the foothills of the Eastern Carpathians in the
   south-western Ukraine. Using comparison with other sites with extremely
   species-rich semi-dry grasslands in the peri-Carpathian region and
   beyond, we show that these grasslands share many important features,
   including similar species composition, occurrence of species with
   disjunct distributions, site conditions, landscape context, long history
   of human influence and traditional management practice. Based on these
   findings, we suggest that continuity on a large (Pleistocene-Holocene)
   time scale and regularly practiced management that reduces the asymmetry
   in competition (typically mowing and absence of fertilizer application)
   may be the crucial factors responsible for the extremely high local
   species richness in east-central European semi-dry grasslands. We also
   suggest that this richness largely originates from an ancient pool of
   species of Eurasian forest-steppe and hemiboreal forests.}},

Abstract = {{The special quality of foods from alpine grazing systems concerning
   their fatty acid (FA) composition is well established. However, the
   contribution of different specific vegetation types and the animal's
   genotype to this alpine effect is still unclear. In the present study,
   the FA profiles of muscle and adipose tissue lipids were determined in
   lambs that had grazed either an intensively managed lowland pasture or
   one of three characteristic alpine vegetation types differing in plant
   species number and composition, forage quality and amount, and
   composition of phenolic compounds and FA. On each vegetation type and in
   two subsequent years, two groups of lambs (seven Engadine sheep, ES; and
   seven Valaisian Black Nose sheep, VS) grazed for 9 weeks and were
   subsequently slaughtered (total n = 110 lambs). Forage samples, meat
   (Longissimus dorsi muscle, LD) and perirenal adipose tissue were
   analysed for their FA composition. Forages were additionally analysed
   for contents of phenolic compounds. Although proportions of
   alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3n-3) and linoleic acid (C18:2n-6) in plant
   biomass were clearly higher in the lowland compared to the alpine
   vegetation, the proportions of these FA were increased in the adipose
   tissue of alpine grazing sheep by 20-87\% and by 26-58\% in muscle
   compared to lowland grazing, depending on the alpine vegetation type.
   The levels of these two FA in body tissues differed between lambs having
   grazed different alpine pastures and were clearly positively associated
   with the contents of phenolic compounds in the vegetation but not with
   its lipid composition. Compared to the lowland pasture, conjugated
   linoleic acid (C18:2c9t11) in the tissues was lower when the lambs
   grazed alpine pastures, but did not differ between the alpine vegetation
   types. Slight breed differences were found, with a trend for higher
   proportions of long chain polyunsaturated FA at cost of saturated and
   monounsaturated FA in the VS compared to the ES. In conclusion,
   vegetation type is an important factor determining the FA composition in
   lamb meat and differentiating the alpine effect in this respect. The
   data clearly suggest that the plant secondary compounds in the swards
   prevented part of C18:3n-3 and C18:2n-6 from being hydrogenated in the
   rumen. Tissue-specific differences in incorporation of Cl 8:2n-6 and
   C18:3n-3 point to a physiological optimum level in the muscle but not in
   the adipose tissue. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Salt marshes of Samborombn Bay (Argentina) have been grazed sporadically
   at very low stocking rates, but in the last decade, grazing intensity
   increased due to agriculture expansion. We investigated the effect of
   cattle grazing on vegetation and soil salinity on the most extended
   Spartina densiflora community. This community develops along an
   elevation gradient where the frequency and duration of tidal flooding
   and soil salinity increased as elevation decreased. Vegetation and soil
   data were collected from a national park excluded to cattle grazing for
   30 years and from an adjacent commercial livestock farm continuously
   grazed by cattle. As elevation level decreased, plant cover, richness
   and diversity of functional groups and species decreased. As we
   expected, grazing altered soil salinity and vegetation composition in
   different extent along the elevation gradient. Grazing changed
   vegetation structure more intensively in the high elevation level
   because it reduced the competitive exclusion exerted by S. densiflora,
   allowing the increase in floristic richness. Grazing increased soil
   salinity and the contribution of salt-tolerant species only in the
   medium but not in the low elevation level probably because the higher
   frequency and duration of tidal flooding counterbalanced the increase in
   evaporation promoted by biomass removal in the low respect to the medium
   elevation level. While grazing may cause positive impacts for plant
   conservation in the high elevation level, it may cause negative
   consequence for livestock production because of the reduction in forage
   quality along the entire elevation gradient.}},

Title = {{Disentangling direct and indirect effects of experimental grassland
   management and plant functional-group manipulation on plant and
   leafhopper diversity}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Background: Plant biodiversity can affect trophic interactions in many
   ways, including direct bottom-up effects on insects, but is negatively
   affected by agricultural intensification. Grassland intensification
   promotes plant productivity, resulting in changes in plant community
   composition, and impacts on higher trophic levels. Here, we use a novel
   grassland management experiment combining manipulations of cutting and
   fertilization with experimental changes in plant functional group
   composition (independent of management effects) to disentangle the
   direct and indirect effects of agricultural management on insect
   herbivore diversity and abundance. We used leafhoppers as model
   organisms as they are a key insect taxon in grasslands and react rapidly
   to management changes. Leafhoppers were sampled between May and
   September 2010 using standardized sweep netting and pan traps.
   Results: Plant diversity, functional group composition and management
   regime in grasslands affected leafhopper species richness and abundance.
   Higher cutting frequencies directly led to decreasing leafhopper species
   richness, presumably due to the higher disturbance frequency and the
   reduction in food-resource heterogeneity. In contrast, fertilizer
   application had only a small indirect negative effect via enhanced
   aboveground plant biomass, reduced plant diversity and changes in
   functional group composition. The manipulated increase in grass cover
   had contrasting direct and indirect effects on leafhopper species
   richness: grass cover directly increased leafhopper species richness,
   but negatively affected plant diversity, which in turn was positively
   related to leafhopper species richness. In conclusion, insect diversity
   is driven in complex direct and indirect ways by grassland management,
   including changes in functional group composition.
   Conclusions: The availability of preferred food sources and the
   frequency of disturbance are important direct and indirect drivers of
   leafhopper species richness, interacting in complex ways with plant
   diversity and food resource heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted an inventory of birds in an agricultural landscape of 45
   000 ha in the Northwest Russia, compared breeding densities of farmland
   species among existing fields types, and followed the seasonal pattern
   of field use by birds over a period of three months of May-July. We
   collected the data on transects in 2005, 2006, 2008, 2010 and 2011. We
   analysed seasonal and spatial patterns of field use by generalised
   additive mixed models and multivariate procedures. The results confirm
   the importance of the region's agrolandscape for migrating birds. We
   observed distinct species communities among field types, especially in
   arable fields during spring migration and in abandoned fields and
   pastures in late summer. Pastures, multispecies grasslands as well as
   abandoned fields exhibited a particularly high habitat value for
   farmland birds. Arable fields had low habitat values for breeding birds.
   Our study reinforces the importance of a mosaic of land uses within the
   agrolandscape not only due to the species-specific habitat selection by
   breeding birds but also intra-seasonal variation in field utilisation
   for both breeding and non-breeding purposes. The results indicate that
   extensive use of grasslands, retention of some of the abandoned fields
   as open fallows, and certain increase of production on cereal fields
   could be a nature-friendly alternative for increasing agricultural
   production in the region. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Responses of predatory invertebrates to seeding density and plant

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{11-20}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, agricultural producers and non-governmental
   organizations have restored thousands of hectares of former cropland in
   the central United States with native grasses and forbs. However, the
   ability of these grassland restorations to attract predatory
   invertebrates has not been well documented, even though predators
   provide an important ecosystem service to agricultural producers by
   naturally regulating herbivores. This study assessed the effects of
   plant richness and seeding density on the richness and abundance of
   surface-dwelling (ants, ground beetles, and spiders) and aboveground
   (ladybird beetles) predatory invertebrates. In the spring of 2006,
   twenty-four 55 m x 55 m-plots were planted to six replicates in each of
   four treatments: high richness (97 species typically planted by The
   Nature Conservancy), at low and high seeding densities, and low richness
   (15 species representing a typical Natural Resources Conservation
   Service Conservation Reserve Program mix, CP25), at low and high seeding
   densities. Ants, ground beetles, and spiders were sampled using pitfall
   traps and ladybird beetles were sampled using sweep netting in
   2007-2009. The abundance of ants, ground beetles, and spiders showed no
   response to seed mix richness or seeding density but there was a
   significant positive effect of richness on ladybird beetle abundance.
   Seeding density had a significant positive effect on ground beetle and
   spider species richness and Shannon-Weaver diversity. These results may
   be related to differences in the plant species composition and relative
   amount of grass basal cover among the treatments rather than richness.

Title = {{Remnant Trees Affect Species Composition but Not Structure of Tropical
   Second-Growth Forest}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Remnant trees, spared from cutting when tropical forests are cleared for
   agriculture or grazing, act as nuclei of forest regeneration following
   field abandonment. Previous studies on remnant trees were primarily
   conducted in active pasture or old fields abandoned in the previous 2-3
   years, and focused on structure and species richness of regenerating
   forest, but not species composition. Our study is among the first to
   investigate the effects of remnant trees on neighborhood forest
   structure, biodiversity, and species composition 20 years
   post-abandonment. We compared the woody vegetation around individual
   remnant trees to nearby plots without remnant trees in the same
   second-growth forests ({''}control plots{''}). Forest structure beneath
   remnant trees did not differ significantly from control plots. Species
   richness and species diversity were significantly higher around remnant
   trees. The species composition around remnant trees differed
   significantly from control plots and more closely resembled the species
   composition of nearby old-growth forest. The proportion of old-growth
   specialists and generalists around remnant trees was significantly
   greater than in control plots. Although previous studies show that
   remnant trees may initially accelerate secondary forest growth, we found
   no evidence that they locally affect stem density, basal area, and
   seedling density at later stages of regrowth. Remnant trees do, however,
   have a clear effect on the species diversity, composition, and
   ecological groups of the surrounding woody vegetation, even after 20
   years of forest regeneration. To accelerate the return of diversity and
   old-growth forest species into regrowing forest on abandoned land,
   landowners should be encouraged to retain remnant trees in agricultural
   or pastoral fields.}},

Abstract = {{Bees are a key component of biodiversity as they ensure a crucial
   ecosystem service: pollination. This ecosystem service is nowadays

   bees rarely benefit from the measures established to promote

   experimentally tested if the spatio-temporal modification of mowing
   regimes within extensively managed hay meadows, a widespread AES, can
   promote bees. We applied a randomized block design, replicated 12 times
   across the Swiss lowlands, that consisted of three different mowing
   treatments: 1) first cut not before 15 June (conventional regime for
   meadows within Swiss AES); 2) first cut not before 15 June, as treatment
   1 but with 15\% of area left uncut serving as a refuge; 3) first cut not
   before 15 July. Bees were collected with pan traps, twice during the
   vegetation season (before and after mowing). Wild bee abundance and
   species richness significantly increased in meadows where uncut refuges
   were left, in comparison to meadows without refuges: there was both an
   immediate (within year) and cumulative (from one year to the following)
   positive effect of the uncut refuge treatment. An immediate positive
   effect of delayed mowing was also evidenced in both wild bees and honey
   bees. Conventional AES could easily accommodate such a simple management
   prescription that promotes farmland biodiversity and is likely to
   enhance pollination services.}},

Abstract = {{Although temporal heterogeneity is a well-accepted driver of
   biodiversity, effects of interannual variation in land-use intensity
   (LUI) have not been addressed yet. Additionally, responses to land use
   can differ greatly among different organisms; therefore, overall effects
   of land-use on total local biodiversity are hardly known. To test for
   effects of LUI (quantified as the combined intensity of fertilization,
   grazing, and mowing) and interannual variation in LUI (SD in LUI across
   time), we introduce a unique measure of whole-ecosystem biodiversity,
   multidiversity. This synthesizes individual diversity measures across up
   to 49 taxonomic groups of plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria from 150
   grasslands. Multidiversity declined with increasing LUI among
   grasslands, particularly for rarer species and aboveground organisms,
   whereas common species and belowground groups were less sensitive.
   However, a high level of interannual variation in LUI increased overall
   multidiversity at low LUI and was even more beneficial for rarer species
   because it slowed the rate at which the multidiversity of rare species
   declined with increasing LUI. In more intensively managed grasslands,
   the diversity of rarer species was, on average, 18\% of the maximum
   diversity across all grasslands when LUI was static over time but
   increased to 31\% of the maximum when LUI changed maximally over time.
   In addition to decreasing overall LUI, we suggest varying LUI across
   years as a complementary strategy to promote biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Areas with relatively high spatial heterogeneity generally have more
   biodiversity than those that are spatially homogeneous areas due to
   increased potential as habitat. Management practices such as controlled
   grazing also affect the biodiversity in grasslands, and we hypothesize
   that this is due in part to the impacts of variation in grazing on plant
   heterogeneity and its spatial patterns. Understanding these mechanisms
   is important for designing an effective grazing system from a livestock
   management point of view. We used satellite-based, above-ground, live
   plant biomass (ALB) estimates at a pasture scale, in an experimental
   area located across the border of the East Block of Grasslands National
   Park (GNP) and an adjacent community pasture, to assess the effects of 5
   intensities of grazing on the spatiotemporal pattern of ALB in mixed
   grasslands. Overall, heterogeneity increased with grazing intensity,
   whereas the spatial range decreased, except at the highest intensity,
   which had no impact on heterogeneity.}},

Title = {{Impacts of disturbance regimes and rates of water resource levels in the
   control of bramble colonization in a pseudo-steppe ecosystem: the case
   of the plain of la Crau (Bouches-du-Rh(o)over-capne, France)}},
Journal = {{ACTA BOTANICA GALLICA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{261-275}},
Abstract = {{The plain of la Crau, located in South Eastern France, is a unique
   pseudo-steppe ecosystem, characterized by the presence of a
   Mediterranean climate, stony soil and limestone conglomerate at 40cm
   depth, and a traditional sheep grazing dating back to 6,000 years.
   Nevertheless, for many decades, this ecosystem has been subjected to
   numerous exogenous disturbance regimes. Indeed, during the 16th century,
   the construction of channels led to the transformation of the dry
   grasslands into hay meadows. Moreover, during the last century,
   agriculture intensification and the industrial development of military
   activities have significantly altered the steppe. Now, the plain of la
   Crau is a fragmented landscape where steppe habitats are connected
   directly with irrigated orchards or hay meadows. The effects on plant
   communities have been a decrease of species richness, a trivialization
   of plant composition and also the colonization of disturbed areas by
   pioneer invasive species such as Rubus ulmifolius Schoot, the elm leaf
   bramble. Absent from the original plant composition, this species can
   colonize areas formerly cultivated and/or subjected to water
   infiltrations coming from the mismanagement of the irrigation of hay
   meadows nearby. The increase of bramble cover is a threat to the Crau,
   because it causes the reduction of herbaceous community available for
   traditional sheep grazing, which is responsible for the organization and
   the structure of the steppe plant communities. To better understand this
   phenomenon and to discriminate the factors responsible for this
   colonization, an experimentation in situ based on the implementation of
   different disturbance regimes (shrub clearing and/or grazing) crossed
   with two levels of water resources has been carried out during three
   years (between November 2010 to September 2013). During this period, we
   have performed a monitoring of the vegetation each spring and measured
   the photosynthetically active radiation at different times to a year (at
   the moment of clearing, before and after grazing, and after the summer
   drought).
   Our results evidence significant changes in the composition and a
   drastic increase of species richness between plots that were cleared and
   grazed each year and those that were not. These differences can be
   explained by a significant reduction in the area occupied by the bramble
   (increase of photosynthetically active radiation). However, the action
   of a single clearing or grazing alone did not succeed in maintaining an
   open environment. No significant action of the drying plots could be
   detected on the plant community and on the dynamics of brambles. In
   order to perform a potential ecological restoration, an annual clearing
   coupled with a return of sheep grazing is recommended. In addition, the
   restoration of the irrigation system is considered in the discussion to
   limit the presence of Brachypodium phoenicoides (L.) Roem. \& Schult
   that develops probably at the expense of typical steppe species.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{161}},

Pages = {{287-300}},
Abstract = {{Ecological restoration can accelerate the resilience of degraded dry
   grasslands. Among the ecological restoration techniques used, soil
   transfer has already given promising results for restoring species-rich
   plant communities by providing the ability to recreate rapidly a habitat
   that corresponds to the reference ecosystem (the non disturbed dry
   grasslands). However, soil transfer is a destructive method, since it
   involves the use of non-renewable resources such as grassland soils of
   the donor sites that are the produce of centuries of interactions
   between climate, plants and animals. In south-eastern France, the plain
   of La Crau is an example of Mediterranean dry grasslands where the
   resilience of the steppe vegetation is extremely slow after land use
   changes which have impacted soil and vegetation. On 7th August 2009, a
   major oil leak occurred in the steppe center, destroying more than 13
   acres of steppe vegetation. As a consequence, in 2010, the polluted soil
   was excavated and evacuated in a specialised dump. This operation was,
   then, combined with various in situ experiments of soil transfer, with
   exclusion of traditional sheep grazing management, to test (i) the
   importance of respecting the vertical organization of the main soil
   horizons and (ii) some opportunities to save this non-renewable
   resource. In May 2011, just after the soil transfer (72,000 tons) was
   achieved in April 2011 from a nearby quarry which extension had been
   authorised prior to the oil leak, different quadrats were materialized
   in the reference steppe vegetation around and in the restored site, with
   at the soil surface: the organic layer (top-soil, treatment ABC) with or
   without compaction (treatment ABCnc), the mineral layer (sub-soil,
   treatment BC) or the altered bedrock only (treatment C). After three
   years of vegetation monitoring, all the different treatments of soil
   transfer resulted in a rapid resilience of steppe vegetation in terms of
   floristic composition and plant species richness. Indeed, in 2013, the
   treatment with the transfer of mineral layer only at the soil surface,
   showed no significant difference in terms of plant species richness with
   the reference steppe plant community. Furthermore, there was a
   significant higher species richness for the treatments with the transfer
   of organic layer, compacted or not, in comparison with the reference
   steppe plant community. In addition, between 2011 and 2013, the natural
   colonisation by some ruderal opportunistic species was very low.
   Nevertheless, the reference steppe plant community organization was not
   restored for none of the different soil transfer treatments, as revealed
   by the calculation of the Bray-Curtis index. In addition, species
   abundances in the uncompacted organic layer, mean vegetation height and
   plant cover were significantly higher, than in the reference steppe
   plant community. Our results show that after only 3 years, the results
   of the different soil transfer treatments seem very promising. It
   appears from this three year monitoring that soil transfer of a mixture
   of the organic (top soil) and mineral (sub soil) layers, without final
   compaction, could be sufficient to boost the natural resilience of the
   typical plants of the reference steppe plant community. It might also be
   possible to increase the surface where the soil will be spread according
   to ratios of 1 to 2 or 1 to 3, instead of 1 to 1. This method will allow
   the protection of the steppe soil that is still a non-renewable
   resource.
   Because none of the different soil transfer treatments has allowed for
   the restoration of the integral steppe plant community, it seems now
   necessary to reinstall the traditional sheep grazing system with the aim
   to increase the restoration of the reference steppe plant community
   spatial organization.}},

Abstract = {{We examined how environmental factors combined with the diverse ways of

   composition and diversity in the Polish part of Central Sudetes Mts.
   Based on the data from 100 research plots altitude, organic matter
   content and exchangeable magnesium in the soil, as well as the maximum
   soil water capacity and amount of sand fraction significantly affected
   species composition. Among the management methods, a significant effect
   on the differentiation of species composition was observed following the
   cessation of usage and mowing. Mown meadows had the highest share of
   forbs in the biomass, whereas those abandoned ones were dominated by
   tall and expansive grasses, mainly Calamagrostis epigejos. The species
   richest grasslands occurred in areas with soils of high water capacity,
   containing high concentrations of calcium and low amounts of total
   nitrogen. No significant effect of management methods on the total
   number of species as well as on the number of forb species was observed.

Abstract = {{A long-term (1993-2013) experiment in grazed semiarid tropical savannas
   in northern Australia tested the impact of varying the frequency (every
   2, 4 and 6 years) and season (June -EDSversus October -LDS) of fire
   compared with unburnt controls on woody cover and pasture composition,
   in grassland and open woodland. Over an 18-year period, woody cover
   increased by 4\% (absolute) in the woodland even with the most severe
   (i.e. frequent, late dry season) fire treatments. With less severe or no
   fire, woody cover increased by 12-17\%. In the grassland, woody cover
   remained static when subjected to LDS fires every 2 or 4 years, but
   increased by 3-6\% under other fire treatments, and by 8\% when unburnt.
   Major shifts in understorey species composition occurred at both sites
   regardless of fire regime. The effect of fire on herbage mass and
   composition was compounded by higher grazing after fires. The herbage
   mass of perennial grasses declined and that of annual grasses and forbs
   increased following early or frequent fires. Brachyachne convergens,
   Gomphrena canescens and Flemingia pauciflora increased in response to
   fire while Aristida latifolia and Heteropogon contortus decreased.
   Four-yearly LDS fire provided the most effective management of woody
   cover and pasture composition. Although EDS fire is recommended for
   biodiversity management and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in wet
   tropical savannas, on grazed pastoral land, it can promote woodland
   thickening and pasture degradation. Optimal fire management, therefore,
   depends on vegetation type, land use and the prevailing seasonal timing
   and frequency of fire.}},

   With the aim to control their spread, we assessed the relationship

   rupestre and evaluated the effects of a B. rupestre-based diet on
   epithelium keratinization of rumen. Our results demonstrated that sheep
   became less selective throughout the experimental trials and B. rupestre
   decreased its aboveground phytomass. Some leaf traits showed significant
   changes ( LDMC, LA, and ADL were higher in ungrazed areas; leaf nitrogen
   content was higher in the grazed ones). In addition, we detected an
   increase of the degree of epithelium keratinization of sheep. Thus high
   grazing pressure can be used to control the spread of B. rupestre, but
   negative effects on animal welfare due to the increase of rumen
   keratinization might be expected.}},

Title = {{Use by small mammals of a chronosequence of tropical rainforest
   revegetation}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{233-242}},
Abstract = {{Context. The conversion of tropical rainforest to grazing pasture
   results in a drastic change in small-mammal community composition.
   Restoring the landscape through ecological revegetation is thus an
   increasingly important management technique to conserve rainforest
   mammals.
   Aims. This study aimed to determine the habitat ages at which species of
   small mammals recolonised revegetated habitats on the southern Atherton
   Tablelands, north-eastern Queensland, Australia. We focussed on changes
   in rainforest mammal abundance and diversity with increasing habitat
   age.
   Methods. Small-mammal trapping and mark-recapture techniques
   investigated mammal diversity, abundance and community composition
   within remnant rainforest, three age classes of ecological revegetation
   and abandoned grazing pasture.
   Key results. Small-mammal community composition differed between remnant
   rainforest and abandoned grazing pasture. The pasture and 3-year old
   revegetated sites were similar in composition, both lacking rainforest
   small mammals. Six-and 7-year old revegetation plantings provided
   suboptimal habitat for both rainforest and grassland mammals, whereas
   16-and 22-year old revegetated habitats were dominated by rainforest
   species, with some individuals being frequently recaptured.
   Conclusions. As revegetated habitats aged, the small-mammal community
   composition transitioned from a grassland-like composition to a
   community dominated by rainforest species.
   Implications. Although rainforest small mammals were very occasionally
   captured within the 6- and 7-year old habitats, revegetated plantings
   were not dominated by rainforest species until the habitat was 16 years
   old. This highlights the importance of commencing revegetation as early
   as possible to minimise future population declines and maximise the
   conservation of rainforest mammals.}},

Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{583-592}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports the effects of different deferments of sheep grazing
   on plant variables of desert steppe vegetation in Inner Mongolia during
   2010-2012. The study was initiated in May 2010 and comprised five
   treatments: no grazing (UG), grazing throughout the growing season (G)
   and grazing deferment for 40, 50 and 60 days (40UG, 50UG and 60UG) from
   the start of the growing season in a completely randomised block design
   replicated three times. The plant species were classified into two
   functional groups (C-3 and C-4 species) and the relationships among
   species composition, biomass and annual precipitation were examined in
   different deferments of sheep grazing. Treatment G significantly
   decreased the biomass of several species compared with some of the
   deferred treatments and treatment UG, because of differences in grazing
   preferences, and, consequently, decreased the aboveground net primary
   productivity (ANPP). Grazing deferment for 40, 50 and 60 days
   significantly increased C-3-species richness and biomass compared with
   treatment UG, whereas grazing sheep's preferences for C-4 plants at some
   growth stages compared with C-3 plants, resulted in lower species
   richness and biomass of C-4 plants in treatments G, 40UG and 50UG in a
   dry year. Similarly, different species responses to treatment 60UG
   resulted in an increase in ANPP in a year with more precipitation during
   the growing season. The annual precipitation patterns strongly affected
   the temporal changes in biomass as well as the responses to grazing,
   indicating that the plant responses in the desert steppe were co-limited
   by grazing and precipitation. These findings provide important insights
   into the management and conservation of desert steppe vegetation in
   Inner Mongolia.}},

   of Parthenium hysterophorus L.}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{209}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{587-596}},
Abstract = {{Parthenium weed (Parthenium hysterophorus L) is believed to reduce the
   above- and below-ground plant species diversity and the above-ground
   productivity in several ecosystems. We quantified the impact of this
   invasive weed upon species diversity in an Australian grassland and
   assessed the resulting shifts in plant community composition following
   management using two traditional approaches. A baseline plant community
   survey, prior to management, showed that the above-ground community was
   dominated by P. hysterophorus, stoloniferous grasses, with a further
   high frequency of species from Malvaceae, Chenopodiaceae and
   Amaranthaceae. In heavily invaded areas, P. hysterophorus abundance and
   biomass was found to negatively correlate with species diversity and
   native species abundance. Digitaria didactyla Willd. was present in high
   abundance when P. hysterophorus was not, with these two species,
   contributing most to the dissimilarity seen between areas. The
   application of selective broad leaf weed herbicides significantly
   reduced P. hysterophorus biomass under ungrazed conditions, but this
   management did not yet result in an increase in species diversity. In
   the above-ground community, P. hysterophorus was partly replaced by the
   introduced grass species Cynodon dactylon L. (Pers.) 1 year after
   management began, increasing the above-ground forage biomass production,
   while D. didactyla replaced P. hysterophorus in the below-ground
   community. This improvement in forage availability continued to
   strengthen over the time of the study resulting in a total increase of
   80\% after 2 years in the ungrazed treatment, demonstrating the stress

Abstract = {{Over the last century, logging, land conversion, and fire suppression
   have reduced longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystems to a small
   fraction of their original range. Fire suppression, in particular, has
   facilitated encroachment by non-fire-tolerant trees and heavy litter
   buildup, leading to shifts in the native plant and animal community. In
   2001, efforts were initiated to re-establish parts of Berry College's
   (Floyd County, GA) fire-suppressed mountain longleaf pine forest using
   combinations of prescribed fire, clear-cutting, planting, and herbicide
   application. We designed this study to determine the effects of
   management practices thus far on vegetation structure and the bird
   community. In 2009, vegetation structure data were collected in longleaf
   pine stands comprising three management classes ranging from low-to
   high-intensity management. Bird surveys were conducted from summer 2009
   to spring 2010, and avifaunal community structure was related to
   vegetative characteristics within each stand. Unmanaged stands were
   strongly associated with common omnivorous, ground-foraging, and
   canopy-nesting birds of mixed woodlands. Intermediately managed stands
   contained mostly birds of mixed diet and aerial-and bark-feeding cavity
   nesters. Heavily managed stands were strongly associated with insect-,
   vertebrate-, seed-, and fruit-eating ground and shrub nesters, with
   several sightings of the near-threatened Bachman's sparrow (Peucaea
   aestivalis Lichtenstein). Intensity of management was positively
   correlated with canopy openness, understory development, and low litter
   levels. These vegetative differences helped explain the bird community
   makeup. We provide baseline data for assessing the impacts of management
   of mountain longleaf pine and similarly fire-suppressed forests on avian
   abundance and species richness.}},

Abstract = {{The production of ecosystem goods and services has increased
   significantly in the last 100 years, while the capacity of ecosystems to
   generate supporting and regulating services has decreased. In this
   context, agriculture and livestock production have become major
   concerns. At the same time, livestock, particularly dairy cows, play a
   key role and can serve to improve ecosystems, production, and rural
   livelihoods. We randomly selected and conducted semistructural
   interviews with 61 dairy family farmers from four cooperatives in the
   Encosta da Serra Geral Region of the Atlantic rainforest in Santa
   Catarina, Brazil. The goal was to analyze their production and
   viewpoints about environmental variables after adopting
   management-intensive grazing (MIG). The overall results showed that when
   farmers changed from semi-confinement and continuous grazing to MIG they
   perceived improvements in production, livelihoods, and ecosystem
   services. Moreover, according to farmers' insights, MIG could be a tool
   to increase water and soil quality, animal health, alleviate poverty,
   and complement Brazilian conservation efforts.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{537-547}},
Abstract = {{Loess grasslands are among the most species-rich grasslands in Europe.
   In many regions only species-poor degraded fragments of formerly
   species-rich loess grasslands remained due to the agricultural
   intensification in the last century. To preserve and restore loess
   grasslands it is necessary to understand, how soil seed banks can
   contribute to the maintenance of diversity. We studied the vegetation
   and seed banks of (i) a loess grassland in a semi-natural state and (ii)
   a degraded loess pasture. We found that species richness was
   significantly lower in the degraded loess pasture (10.2 species/m(2))
   than in the semi-natural loess grassland (27.0 species/m(2)). Mean seed
   bank densities were quite similar in the two grassland types (22,800 and
   20,200 seeds/m(2), respectively). Out of the frequent graminoids in the
   vegetation, only Poa angustifolia possessed considerable dense seed
   banks. Forb species having considerable seed banks were mainly
   disturbance-tolerant species (e.g. Euphorbia cyparissias, Galium verum
   or Hypericum perforatum). Most characteristic forb species possessed
   only sporadic seed banks (e.g. Filipendula vulgaris, Pimpinella
   saxifraga and Salvia nemorosa). Our results suggest that seed banks have
   only a limited role in the recovery of loess grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands play an important role in carbon sequestration. Different
   management regimes may change the species composition of plants in
   grasslands, thus may affect the carbon sequestration potential.
   Therefore, we investigated if short-term changes in species composition
   occurred in response to shift in grazing to mowing in a semi-arid
   grassland in Hungary (Bugac). Species abundances were recorded as
   frequencies of species in contiguous 5 cm x 5 cm quadrates along six (5
   meters long) permanent transects at adjacent grazed and mowed sites in
   the spring and fall of 2012. High variation of vegetation
   characteristics was found within the management units at patch scale (at
   few m scale). The species richness, relative abundance of species,
   species density, Shannon diversity index, and forage quality differed
   among transects; however, no differences were observed between the two
   managements regimes at site scale (at hectar scale) (ANOVA, p>0.05). The
   average species abundance of the grazed and mowed sites were very
   similar (Poa spp.: 13.48 +/- 5.34\%, 14.67 +/- 6,9\%; Carex spp.: 12.46
   +/- 8.75\%, 14.24 +/- 10.16\%; Cynodon dactylon: 10 +/- 8.52\%, 16.01
   +/- 3.49\%., respectively). Our results suggest that species composition
   differences can not be the main factors explaining short-term
   differences in carbon sequestration in natural semiarid grasslands.}},

Title = {{Climate change and Mediterranean seagrass meadows: a synopsis for
   environmental managers}},
Journal = {{MEDITERRANEAN MARINE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{462-473}},
Abstract = {{This synopsis focuses on the effects of climate change on Mediterranean
   seagrasses, and associated communities, and on the contribution of the
   main species, Posidonia oceanica, to the mitigation of climate change
   effects through sequestering carbon dioxide. Whilst the regression of
   seagrass meadows is well documented, generally linked to anthropogenic
   pressures, global warming could be a cause of new significant
   regression, notably linked to the introduction of exotic species, the
   rise of Sea-Surface Temperature (SST), and relative sea level. Seagrass
   communities could also be affected by climate change through the
   replacement of high structural complexity seagrass species by species of
   lower complexity and even by opportunistic introduced species. Although
   it is currently very difficult to predict the consequences of these
   alterations and their cascade effects, two main potential conflicting
   trends in the functioning of seagrass ecosystems are acceleration of the
   herbivore pathway or the detritivore pathway. The mean net primary
   production of the dominant species, Posidonia oceanica, is relatively
   high and can be estimated to range between 92.5 to 144.7 g C m(-2)
   a(-1). Around 27\% of the total carbon fixed by this species enters the
   sedimentary pathway leading to formation, over millennia, of highly
   organic deposits, rich in refractory carbon. At the Mediterranean scale,
   the sequestration rate might reach 1.09 Tg C a(-1). The amount of this
   stored carbon is estimated to range from 71 to 273 kg C m(-2), which
   when considered at the Mediterranean scale would represent 11 to 42\% of
   the CO2 emissions produced by Mediterranean countries since the
   beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The greatest value of the P.
   oceanica ecosystem, in the context of mitigation of global climate
   change, is linked to this vast long-term carbon stock accumulated over
   millennia, and therefore, efforts should be focused on preserving the
   meadows to keep this reservoir intact.}},

Abstract = {{The livestock industry is converting mountain ecosystems in central
   Argentina into rocky deserts. However, it helps to conserve plant
   biodiversity, presumably because the ecosystem has evolved under wild
   herbivores now locally extinct. We hypothesized that low or moderate
   livestock stocking rates, instead of the high stocking rates currently
   used for commercial production, might mimic pre-hispanic herbivore
   pressures. Thus, the mosaic of physiognomies necessary to maintain
   landscape diversity and soil integrity could be preserved. To test this
   hypothesis we tracked physiognomic changes in 200 plots (16 m(2) each)
   under different stocking rates, including livestock exclusion, for five
   years. Contrary to our expectations, we found that both low and moderate
   stocking rates failed to maintain landscape diversity. As observed for
   livestock exclusion, low to moderate stocking rates promote retraction
   and, finally, elimination of short grazing lawns and their replacement
   by tall tussock grasslands, or possibly by woody vegetation. In turn,
   heavy grazing pressure maintains the desired short lawn patches in the
   landscape, but also promotes a concomitant loss and eventual elimination
   of woodlands, together with an expansion of bare rock as a consequence
   of soil erosion. These results indicate that the present mosaic of
   physiognomic types is difficult to maintain and raise questions about
   the past stability of the ecosystem. We suggest that during the last 400
   years of livestock production in the ecosystem, short lawns have been
   maintained by means of heavy stocking rates and anthropogenic fires
   ignited to eliminate tussocks. However, this relative stability of lawns
   has been attained concomitantly with a progressive loss of soils and
   woodland area. We also discuss some possible explanations for the
   maintenance of short lawns before the introduction of livestock, based
   on main climatic and floristic shifts during the late Holocene. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In the Peruvian highlands, climate change and inadequate management are
   causing land degradation and collapse of the pastoral system. Our
   research project was aimed at assessing the impact of grazing on dry
   Puna ecosystem, as understanding and predicting vegetation changes in
   harsh environments in the face of different disturbance regimes is
   required for aware and effective management. The study area was the
   Salinas and Aguada Blanca National Reserve. Two experimental areas were
   selected, characterized by deep soils with gentle slopes and by shallow
   soils with steeper slopes. In each area, sites with low and high
   disturbance regimes were identified, and vegetation was sampled using 10
   x 10m plots. The results indicated that the environmental constraints
   have a marked influence on the species composition, while disturbance
   quantitatively affects diversity. The floristic changes observed under
   different disturbance intensities are mainly related to the functional
   differentiation of the plant communities and to the decrease in
   vegetation cover. These processes pose a serious risk to the livelihood
   of the local people, because they can lead to the loss of biodiversity
   and economic value of pastures, as well as to soil erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands managed by mowing and grazing are an important
   part of European landscape. Orthopterans are considered to be an
   appropriate indicator to assess the impact of agricultural management on
   grassland ecosystems. We,studied effects of mowing, grazing and two
   kinds of edges on Orthoptera of submontane hay meadows and pastures in
   the Hruby Jesenik Mts. (Czech Republic). Using sweep netting and pan
   trapping, we sampled orthopteran assemblages associated with the
   farmland managed for at least five years under Czech agri-environmental
   schemes. In total we collected 2253 individuals of orthopterans
   representing 14 species. The short-term impacts of mowing and grazing
   were tested by multivariate ordination analyses. The results indicate
   that mowing significantly decreased Orthoptera species abundance.
   Conversely, the response of orthopterans to grazing was not
   statistically significant and appeared to be species-specific. The
   abundance of acridid Gomphocerippus rufus increased substantially with
   grazing, which is in contrast with its negative response to mowing. The
   negative influence of mowing on grassland inhabitants can be mitigated
   by lower mowing frequency and by providing temporary uncut refuges. The
   results of generalized linear models showed significant increase of both
   species richness and total abundance of Orthoptera towards the baulks.
   Therefore, the refuges should be established primarily along grass
   baulks or similar types of permanent grassy edges. As a general rule an
   effort should be made when managing grasslands to ensure the highest
   habitat heterogeneity}},

Abstract = {{After foundation of the Wadden Sea National Park, grazing and artificial
   drainage was ceased or reduced on large areas of the salt marshes at the
   Schleswig-Holstein mainland coast (Northern Germany). The effect of
   grazing cessation versus intensive and moderate grazing on vegetation
   diversity was studied on small (plant species richness on plots between
   0.01 and 100 m(2)) and large scale (vegetation type richness per
   hectare) over 18 to 20 years by analysing data from long-term monitoring
   programs. Plant species richness and vegetation type richness increased
   strongly over time in all management regimes, because grazing-sensitive
   species increased first in ungrazed marshes and later dispersed to and
   established in intensively grazed marshes. Dominance of the tall,
   late-successional grass Elymus athericus on 7\% to 52\% of all
   moderately and ungrazed (primarily high marsh) plots led to a decrease
   in species richness. After 18 to 20 years, species richness was highest
   in moderately and intensively grazed high marshes. Differences were
   significant only on small plots of up to 4 m2. On the large scale,
   vegetation type richness in the low marsh was higher without grazing,
   while no differences were found in the high marsh. Our results indicate
   that grazing effects differ between spatial scales and that different
   spatial scales have to be considered for monitoring and evaluation of
   vegetation diversity in salt marshes. To conserve vegetation diversity
   on all scales, a large-scale mosaic of different management regimes
   should be maintained. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Intensification of land use in semi-natural hay meadows has resulted in
   a decrease in species diversity. This is often thought to be caused by
   the reduced establishment of plant species due to high competition for
   light under conditions of increased productivity. Sowing experiments in
   grasslands have found reliable evidence that diversity can also be
   constrained by seed availability, implying that processes influencing
   the production and persistence of seeds may be important for the
   functioning of ecosystems. So far, the effects of land-use
   intensification on the seed rain and the persistence of seeds in the
   soil have been unclear.
   We selected six pairs of extensively managed (Festuco-Brometea) and
   intensively managed (Arrhenatheretalia) grassland with traditional late
   cutting regimes across Switzerland and covering an annual productivity
   gradient in the range 176-1211 gm(-2). In each grassland community, we
   estimated seed rain and seed bank using eight pooled seed-trap or
   topsoil samples of 89 cm(2) in each of six plots representing an area of
   c. 150 m(2). The seed traps were established in spring 2010 and
   collected simultaneously with soil cores after an exposure of c. three
   months. We applied the emergence method in a cold frame over eight
   months to estimate density of viable seeds.
   With community productivity reflecting land-use intensification, the
   density and species richness in the seed rain increased, while mean seed
   size diminished and the proportions of persistent seeds and of species
   with persistent seeds in the topsoil declined. Stronger limitation of
   seeds in extensively managed semi-natural grasslands can explain the
   fact that such grasslands are not always richer in species than more
   intensively managed ones. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Southwestern Lithuania. The edge effect on overall herbaceous species
   composition of coniferous forests was evaluated by Canonical
   Correspondence Analysis. The species richness of herbs and mosses in the
   coniferous forest was highest in the forest edge and declined towards
   interior. The highest decrease in the number of species occurred within
   0 to 5 m to the edge. The highest cover of herbs and mosses was in the
   forest edge and decreased towards the forest interior. CCA biplot showed
   a good correlation of overall species composition and the distance to
   the forest edge. Distribution of species along edge to interior gradient
   depended on the species response to different ecological factors.
   Ellenberg value of light was higher in the edge. Ellenberg value of
   nitrogen was higher in the forest interior.}},

Abstract = {{Plant diversity is a key driver of ecosystem functioning best documented
   for its influence on plant productivity. The strength and direction of
   plant diversity effects on species interactions across trophic levels
   are less clear. For example, with respect to the interactions between
   herbivorous invertebrates and plants, a number of competing hypotheses
   have been proposed that predict either increasing or decreasing
   community herbivory with increasing plant species richness. We
   investigated foliar herbivory rates and consumed leaf biomass along an
   experimental grassland plant diversity gradient in year eight after
   establishment. The gradient ranged from one to 60 plant species and
   manipulated also functional group richness (from one to four functional
   groups-legumes, grasses, small herbs, and tall herbs) and plant
   community composition. Measurements in monocultures of each plant
   species showed that functional groups differed in the quantity and
   quality of herbivory damage they experienced, with legumes being more
   damaged than grasses or non-legume herbs. In mixed plant communities,
   herbivory increased with plant diversity and the presence of two key
   plant functional groups in mixtures had a positive (legumes) and a
   negative (grasses) effect on levels of herbivory. Further, plant
   community biomass had a strong positive impact on consumed leaf biomass,
   but little effect on herbivory rates. Our results contribute detailed
   data from a well-established biodiversity experiment to a growing body
   of evidence suggesting that an increase of herbivory with increasing
   plant diversity is the rule rather than an exception. Considering
   documented effects of herbivory on other ecosystem functions and the
   increase of herbivory with plant diversity, levels of herbivory damage
   might not only be a result, but also a trigger within the
   diversity-productivity relationship.}},

Abstract = {{Limited information is available on the dry matter production, protein
   content and species composition of complex mixtures of introduced
   perennial forage crop species for hay and pasture in the moister regions
   of Saskatchewan. A field experiment was sown on 2008 May 27 at Melfort,
   Saskatchewan, Canada, on a thick Black Chernozem (Udic Boroll) silty
   clay soil, to compare the effects on dry matter yield (DMY), protein
   content and species composition of perennial forage crop monocultures
   and mixtures, under a two-cut and a three-cut management system, in
   2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. Eleven treatments consisted of monocultures
   of hybrid bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm. x Bromus inermis Leyss.),
   smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss.), crested wheatgrass
   {[}Agropyron cristatum (L.) Gaertn], intermediate wheatgrass
   {[}Agropyron intermedium (Host.) Beauv.] and alfalfa (Medicago sativa
   L.); simple mixtures of each of these individual grass species with
   alfalfa; a more complex mixture of all these grass species and alfalfa,
   and a very complex mixture consisting of the complex mixture plus meadow
   bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata
   L.), tall fescue {[}Festuca arundinacea (Schreb.) Wimm.], timothy
   (Phleum pratense L.) and slender wheatgrass {[}Elymus trachycaulus
   (Link) Gould ex Shinners]. The alfalfa was inoculated with rhizobium,
   and no fertilizer was added to any treatment during the course of the
   study. The two-cut system yielded higher than the three-cut system in
   all years. In 2009, the first cutting year, all treatments, especially
   under the two-cut system, produced similar forage DMY, with monoculture
   grasses yielding as much as that of their mixture with alfalfa. In 2010,
   2011 and 2012, however, monoculture alfalfa and grass-alfalfa treatments
   had higher DMY than the monoculture grasses. Monoculture alfalfa also
   showed superior DMY than most grass-alfalfa mixtures, especially during
   the last 2 yr of the study. In conclusion, the inclusion of alfalfa in
   forage mixtures, grown in unfertilized soil, significantly increased
   forage yield, especially after the first production year, and these
   grass-alfalfa mixtures yielded almost as much as monoculture alfalfa.
   Also, the inclusion of alfalfa significantly increased the forage
   protein content over the grass alone treatments. Hybrid bromegrass,
   grown alone or in mixture with alfalfa, yielded similar to the other
   grasses tested, while crested wheatgrass did not compete as well as
   other main grasses, grown alone or in mixture with alfalfa. In this
   study, the use of complex or very complex mixtures of introduced grasses
   with alfalfa did not increase DMY over the simple grass-alfalfa
   mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing meadow bird demographic trends in Europe raise the question of
   the effectiveness of public policy aiming to halt biodiversity loss. In
   this study, we attempted to understand the success and failures in one
   of the first French Agri-Environment Schemes (AES), 20 years after its
   implementation. After annually postponing grass harvesting to 1 or 15
   July in 25 \% of a 3,000-ha lowland meadow system, we observed a clear
   demographic increase in the Eurasian Curlew Numenius arquata, the
   Whinchat Saxicola rubetra and the Yellow Wagtail Motacilla flava. No
   positive effects were recorded for the Skylark Alauda arvensis, the Corn
   Bunting Miliaria calandra and the Reed Bunting Emberiza schoeniclus,
   possibly as a result of increased competition with Whinchats and Yellow
   Wagtails, and the Corncrake Crex crex declined sharply despite the
   implemented measures. The successful results were attributed, for the
   Curlew to the species' early nesting and high adult survival, for the
   Whinchat to the probable support of immigration, and for the Yellow
   Wagtail to a possible capacity to avoid unfavourable nesting situations.
   Late breeding and low adult survival may contribute to explain the
   continuing Corncrake decline. In the study site, late mown AES areas
   were too small and fragmented to match efficiently the territory
   aggregations. We recommend to extend AES principles to all the European
   range of targeted species, even outside the EU, and to develop
   species-specific spatial strategies.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsHow are plant species richness and diversity related to spatial
   autocorrelation under grazed and ungrazed conditions in grassland
   communities? Is spatial autocorrelation dissimilar within different
   plant communities?
   LocationThe grasslands of southeast North Dakota, USA.
   MethodsThe study was conducted during the summer of 2009 in six
   grasslands under different management (grazed vs ungrazed with fire)
   along a moisture gradient. Spatial autocorrelation at each site was
   measured along 50-m transects among three different landscape positions
   representing different moisture levels. Dissimogram multivariate
   analysis was used to measure the nugget, dissimilarity and patch
   diameter. Additionally, richness and Shannon diversity indices and
   nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis were compared to the
   dissimogram results.
   ResultsMean patch diameter was significantly higher in grazed mid-slope
   sites than in ungrazed sites. Spatial autocorrelation was not different
   between the landscape positions (higher, dry areas were not different
   from lower, mesic areas). However, plant species richness, diversity and
   community composition were found to be different between landscape
   positions and management, with key differences in the presence of
   certain invasive species.
   ConclusionsDisturbance and moisture level were reflected differently in
   the spatial autocorrelation analysis compared to the richness, diversity
   and ordination analyses. This indicates that disturbance and management
   impacted spatial autocorrelation separate from plant community
   composition and species diversity. This also highlights changes in the
   plant community caused by different management actions and the spread of
   invasive species.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsDoes epizoochorous dispersal via sheep lead to the
   establishment of populations of sandy grassland species on newly
   created, managed restoration sites on sandy bare soil? Do
   epizoochorously-induced spatial patterns persist during vegetation
   development? Does sandy grassland develop, which is rich in
   epizoochorously-dispersed target species?
   LocationUpper Rhine Valley, Germany.
   MethodsA 6-yr experiment on epizoochorous dispersal by sheep was
   conducted on three newly created deep sand deposition sites mimicking
   restoration areas with reduced nutrient availability. Establishment
   success and persistence of ten epizoochorously-dispersed species were
   assessed and spatial patterns were analysed using SADIE (Spatial
   Analysis by Distance Indices). Vegetation development of the
   experimental areas was related to a nearby nature reserve (releves,
   target species ratios). In addition, seed rain and early-successional
   soil seed bank were sampled.
   ResultsAll but one species dispersed by sheep became established and
   persisted during the 6-yr study. After establishment, most perennials
   did not change or increased in abundance over time, whereas annuals
   showed various population dynamics. Spatial patterns were aggregated for
   most study species. Similarity of spatial patterns between consecutive
   years varied by species, site and year, and was stronger in perennial
   than in annual species. Patterns of seed dispersal and establishment
   were positively associated with each other (a subset of three species
   was tested). Within 6yrs, the proportion, but not the cover, of target
   species in the experimental areas reached a level similar to that of a
   nearby nature reserve; however, many species characteristic of the
   nature reserve were absent. The species compositions of both seed bank
   and seed rain were dominated by non-target species.
   ConclusionsSheep flocks may assist in colonization of grassland species
   on newly created bare soil areas via epizoochory. The incorporation of
   livestock into restoration projects might facilitate the regeneration
   and preservation of threatened plant populations. Livestock might be
   most successful in promoting biodiversity if they are moved from
   communities with target species to restoration areas.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Invasion of non-native species is among the top threats for the
   biodiversity and functioning of native and agricultural ecosystems
   worldwide. We investigated whether the herbivory of the slug Arion
   vulgaris (formerly Arion lusitanicus; Gastropoda), that is listed among
   the 100 worst alien species in Europe, is affected by soil organisms
   commonly present in terrestrial ecosystems (i.e. earthworms-Annelida:
   Lumbricidae and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi-AMF, Glomerales). We
   hypothesized that slug herbivory would be affected by soil organisms via
   altered plant nutrient availability and plant quality. In a greenhouse
   experiment, we created a simple plant community consisting of a grass, a
   forb, and a legume species and inoculated these systems with either two
   earthworm species and/or four AMF taxa. Slugs were introduced after
   plants were established. Earthworms significantly reduced total slug
   herbivory in AMF-inoculated plant communities (P = 0.013). Across plant
   species, earthworms increased leaf total N and secondary metabolites,
   AMF decreased leaf thickness. Mycorrhizae induced a shift in slug
   feeding preference from non-legumes to legumes; the grass was generally
   avoided by slugs. AMF effects on legume herbivory can partly be
   explained by the AMF-induced increase in total N and decrease in C/N
   ratio; earthworm effects are less clear as no worm-induced alterations
   of legume plant chemistry were observed. The presence of earthworms
   increased average AMF colonization of plant roots by 140 \% (P < 0.001).
   Total shoot mass was significantly increased by AMF (P < 0.001). These
   data suggest that the feeding behavior of this invasive slug is altered
   by a belowground control of plant chemical quality and community
   structure.}},

Title = {{Vegetation response to removal of non-native feral pigs from Hawaiian

Abstract = {{Globally, non-native ungulates threaten native biodiversity, alter
   biotic and abiotic factors regulating ecological processes, and incur
   significant economic costs via herbivory, rooting, and trampling.
   Removal of non-native ungulates is an increasingly common and crucial
   first step in conserving and restoring native forests. However, removal
   is often controversial and there is currently little information on
   plant community responses to this management action. Here, we examine
   the response of native and non-native understory vegetation in paired
   sites inside and outside of exclosures across a 6.5-18.5 year
   chronosequence of feral pig (Sus scrofa) removal from canopy-intact
   Hawaiian tropical montane wet forest. Stem density and cover of native
   plants, species richness of ground-rooted native woody plants, and
   abundance of native plants of conservation interest were all
   significantly higher where feral pigs had been removed. Similarly, the
   area of exposed soil was substantially lower and cover of litter and
   bryophytes was greater with feral pig removal. Spatial patterns of
   recruitment were also strongly affected. Whereas epiphytic establishment
   was similar between treatments, the density of ground-rooted woody
   plants was four times higher with feral pig removal. Abundance of
   invasive non-native plants also increased at sites where they had
   established prior to feral pig removal. We found no patterns in any of
   the measured variables with time, suggesting that commonly occurring
   species recover within 6.5 years of feral pig removal. Recovery of
   species of conservation interest, however, was highly site specific and
   limited to areas that possessed remnant populations at the time of
   removal, indicating that some species take much longer (> 18.5 years) to
   recover. Feral pig removal is the first and most crucial step for
   conservation of native forests in this area, but subsequent management
   should also include control of non-native invasive plants and
   outplanting native species of conservation interest that fail to recruit
   naturally.}},

Title = {{Variation of grazing-induced vegetation changes across a large-scale

Abstract = {{QuestionsDoes the magnitude of grazing-induced changes in species
   composition vary with habitat productivity? How does the sign and
   magnitude of grazing effects on species richness and beta-diversity
   change with increasing productivity? Do major life forms exhibit
   consistent responses to grazing along productivity gradients?
   LocationSteppes and grasslands of southern South America in Argentina
   and Uruguay.
   MethodsWe evaluated grazing effects on plant composition, species
   richness, beta-diversity and life-form abundances along a ten-fold,
   regional productivity gradient and within subregions of contrasting
   productivity, using a common sampling protocol for 23 paired grazed vs
   ungrazed plots. The annual integral of the normalized difference
   vegetation index was used as a surrogate for above-ground net primary
   productivity.
   ResultsCompositional dissimilarity between grazed and ungrazed plots, as
   well as grazing-induced differences in plant richness and beta-diversity
   all increased with habitat productivity. Grazing decreased species
   richness in low-productive steppes but enhanced the richness of
   high-productive grasslands. On average, grazing reduced beta-diversity
   in high-productive sites but not in low-productive sites. Dominant
   species were more strongly suppressed by grazing towards productive
   grasslands. Grazing generally decreased shrub species cover, whereas
   graminoid and forb cover did not consistently change with grazing
   through the productivity gradient.
   ConclusionsOur results indicate that the overall grazing effects on
   vegetation structure increased along a regional productivity gradient.
   Yet the sign of grazing impacts on species richness and beta-diversity
   shifted with habitat productivity, in agreement with models of
   herbivore-mediated co-existence and species colonization in productive
   systems. Further, we found that narrowing the spatial extent of analysis
   to the subregion generally obscured grazing-productivity relationships.
   Biodiversity conservation programmes should carefully weigh the varied
   impacts of livestock grazing across productivity gradients.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionThe assembly of plants into communities is one of the central
   topics in plant community ecology. The objective of this study was to
   investigate how plant functional trait diversity and environmental
   factors influence community assembly in two different grassland
   communities, and if variation in these factors could explain the
   difference in species assembly between these communities.
   LocationSix grazed ex-arable fields and eight semi-natural grasslands in
   southeast Sweden.
   MethodsWe estimated species abundance and measured soil attributes at
   each site. For each species within each site we measured specific leaf
   area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and seed mass. We analysed
   the data both for abundance-weighted species values and species
   occurrence.
   ResultsTrait gradient analysis indicated random distribution of species
   among sites, while CCA analysis indicated that both soil phosphorus and
   moisture were related to species assembly at a site. Correlations and
   fourth-corner analysis also revealed a relationship between measured
   species traits and soil phosphorus and moisture. There was a lower
   average seed mass and higher SLA of species in ex-arable fields compared
   to species in semi-natural grasslands.
   ConclusionsEven though trait gradient analysis indicated that plant
   community assembly in the studied grasslands was random, other results
   implied that species occurrence and abundance was influenced both by
   environmental factors and species traits. Higher species richness in
   semi-natural grasslands was associated with more large-seeded species
   found there compared to ex-arable fields, indicating that large-seeded
   species establish in grasslands later than small-seeded species.}},

Abstract = {{Abandonment of traditional land-use practices can have strong effects on
   the abundance of species occurring in agricultural landscapes. However,
   the precise mechanisms by which individual performance and population
   dynamics are affected are still poorly understood. To assess how
   abandonment affects population dynamics of Succisa pratensis we used
   data from a 4-year field study in both abandoned and traditionally
   grazed areas in moist and mesic habitats to parameterize integral
   projection models. Abandoned populations had a lower long-term
   stochastic population growth rate (lambda (S) = 0.90) than traditionally
   managed populations (lambda (S) = 1.08), while lambda (S) did not differ
   between habitat types. The effect of abandonment differed significantly
   between years and had opposed effects on different vital rates.
   Individuals in abandoned populations experienced higher mortality rates
   and lower seedling establishment, but had higher growth rates and
   produced more flower heads per plant. Population viability analyses,
   based on a population survey of the whole study area in combination with
   our demographic models, showed that 32 \% of the populations face a high
   risk of extinction (> 80 \%) within 20 years. These results suggest that
   immediate changes in management are needed to avoid extinctions and
   further declines in population sizes. Stochastic elasticity analyses and
   stochastic life table response experiments indicated that management
   strategies would be most effective if they increase survival of small
   plants as well as seedling establishment, while maintaining a high seed
   production. This may be achieved by varying the grazing intensity
   between years or excluding grazers when plants are flowering.}},

Abstract = {{This article introduces a Special Issue on biodiversity of Palaearctic
   grasslands and provides a synthesis of the current knowledge on this
   topic. Four major categories of grasslands can be distinguished in the
   Palaearctic biogeographic realm: (a) zonal steppes (in areas too dry for
   forests), (b) arctic-alpine grasslands (in areas too cold for forests),
   (c) azonal and extrazonal grasslands (where hydrology, soil conditions,
   relief or natural disturbances within the forest biomes prevent tree
   growth locally) and (d) secondary grasslands (which replace natural
   forests in consequence of human land use). We summarize the present
   knowledge about species richness patterns (mainly of vascular plants)
   along abiotic and land use gradients. Further, we highlight the
   usefulness of diversity measures not based on species richness, namely
   functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity and within-species
   diversity. The strong differences observed for diversity patterns
   according to analyzed biodiversity parameter, spatial scale or taxonomic
   group call for comparative studies and caution when generalizing
   results. A particular challenge are the extreme plot-scale species
   richness values found in grasslands of a few European regions. We
   propose a conceptual model that explains the findings by an interplay of
   various factors acting at different levels: (i) The largest species pool
   is expected for habitats under conditions that prevailed over the last
   few million years, with a slight shift towards intermediate positions,
   i.e. for the Palaearctic in open, semi-dry, base-rich situations. (ii)
   The landscape-level species pool is increased by continuity of a
   grassland patch in space and time and heterogeneity of the surrounding
   landscape. (iii) The coexistence of regionally available species at a
   plot scale is due to reduced competitive exclusion according to
   Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, mowing once a year without
   fertilization being particularly effective. Ecosystem functions and
   services of Palaearctic grasslands are often positively connected to
   their biodiversity. At the same time, these communities and their biota
   are nowadays highly endangered. The semi-natural (High Nature Value)
   grasslands of Europe are mainly threatened by agricultural
   intensification or abandonment on low-productive sites in remote areas,
   while the natural steppes of the Palaearctic have largely been destroyed
   by conversion into arable land. Finally, we present some promising
   conservation and management approaches and call for a strong and
   comprehensive Convention on Grassland Conservation. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We present here the first systematic study on drivers of bird community
   composition and diversity in Anatolian steppes (Turkey), an environment
   important for populations of threatened grassland birds yet
   underrepresented in conservation networks. We focused on one million
   hectares of mountainous land with a long and varied land use history,
   and collected quantitative data on breeding birds as well as
   environmental, vegetation, landscape and land use parameters at 32
   sites. Data were analyzed by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and
   hierarchical partitioning to understand avian community structure and
   reveal major drivers of observed patterns. Bird communities in
   high-altitude steppes of inner Turkey showed patterns in species
   richness and community composition that were best explained by an
   altitudinal gradient and by human activities. Steppe birds occurred most
   often in cropland abandoned 20-50 years ago with good coverage of erect
   leafy plants while overall avian diversity tended to increase with
   reduced grazing pressure and with nearby presence of rural settlements.
   CCA results revealed a contrast between highly heterogeneous
   anthropogenic environments in warmer and drier land with woody elements,
   and treeless steppes at higher elevations that were, apart from
   transhumant grazing, little influenced by human activities. The former
   sites were characterized by the occurrence of several grassland birds
   along with a variety of generalist species, some of which required the
   presence of trees, while the latter sites were less diverse but usually
   with a higher proportion of steppe-dependent birds in their composition.
   To conserve steppes for birds, we recommend as key actions to maintain
   the current landscape mosaic, sustain low to moderate grazing levels and
   use our findings in developing a network of protected areas. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Abandonment or change of traditional (pre-modern) management systems
   threaten semi-natural grasslands worldwide. Understanding existing
   traditional grassland management could greatly help to improve our
   ability to preserve biodiversity in traditionally managed farmlands. We
   studied the management of species-rich man-made grasslands (ca. 32-52
   vascular plant species on 16 m(2)) and the related traditional
   ecological knowledge in Gyimes (Romania), where more than 40,000
   hectares of meadows and pastures are still managed traditionally.
   Methods of ecological anthropology e.g. participatory field work,
   semi-structured interviews (33 interviewees), and free listings were
   used. Csangos (people living in these valleys of the Carpathians)
   distinguish hay meadows based on manuring: nearby and distant hay
   meadows. Pastures are classified into pastures near settlements,
   mountain pastures, and pastures for sheep. Traditional management of
   meadows includes mowing, cleaning, mowing-date rotation of tracts,
   amelioration with hayseed and Onobrychis viciifolia seeds, manuring,
   manual thinning of unwanted plants, suppression of mosses, and
   small-scale drainage. We argue that the mowing-date rotation system
   found in Gyimes is a unique land-use practice that could greatly enhance
   biodiversity together with hayseed scattering. Treatment of pastures
   is-more simple: sectional cleaning of shrubs/trees, and burning and
   corralling against Nardus. The goal of Csangos is not to protect
   biodiversity, but to keep their grasslands in good condition for a long
   run, and thus ascertain the availability of hay in the needed quantity
   and quality. We argue that subsidy systems should encourage the
   maintenance of this and similar systems, support the still existing
   local traditional communities and also in protected areas management
   systems should build on the experiences of these small-scale traditional
   farmers. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{Meat quality includes intrinsic qualities (the characteristics of the
   product itself) and extrinsic qualities (e. g. animal health and
   welfare, environmental impacts, price). There is still a high level of
   variability in beef palatability, which induces consumer
   dissatisfaction. We also observe a general trend towards an increasing
   importance of healthiness and safety (intrinsic) and environmental
   issues and animal welfare (extrinsic). Most grading systems describe
   carcasses using only animal traits (e. g. weight, conformation, fatness,
   animal age and sex). In North American and Asian countries, emphasis has
   been put on maturity and marbling. The European system is mainly based
   on yield estimation. The Meat Standards Australia grading scheme, which
   predicts beef palatability for each cut, proved to be effective in
   predicting beef palatability in many other countries. Some genetic
   markers are available to improve beef quality. In addition, gene and
   protein expression profiling of the bovine muscle revealed that the
   expression level of many genes and the abundance of many proteins may be
   potential indicators of muscle mass, tenderness, flavour or marbling of
   meat. The integration of all these parameters is likely to predict
   better beef palatability. The integration of extrinsic qualities in the
   prediction model increases the difficulty of achieving a global
   evaluation of overall meat quality. For instance, with respect to
   environmental issues, each feeding system has its own advantages and
   disadvantages. Despite this, win-win strategies have been identified.
   For example, animals that were less stressed at slaughter also produced
   more tender meat, and in some studies the most economically efficient
   farms had the lowest environmental impact. In other cases, there are
   trade-offs among and between intrinsic and extrinsic qualities. In any
   case, the combination of the different integrative approaches appears
   promising to improve the prediction of overall beef quality. A relevant
   combination of indicators related to sensory and nutritional quality,
   social and environmental considerations (such as e. g. carbon footprint,
   animal welfare, grassland biodiversity, rural development) and economic
   efficiency (income of farmers and of other stakeholders of the supply
   chain, etc.) will allow the prediction of the overall quality of beef
   mainly for consumers but also for any stakeholder in the supply chain.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Fire as a natural disturbance has been present in most European
   grasslands. Controlled burning was also an important component of the
   traditional landscape management for millennia. It was mainly used to
   reduce litter and woody vegetation and to maintain open landscapes
   suitable for farming. Due to socio-economical changes traditional and
   sustainable use of fire was ceased and replaced by arsons and technical
   fires in Europe. Despite its wide application in the past and the
   considerable extension and frequency of current grassland fires, the
   impact of fire on the grassland biodiversity is still scarcely
   documented in Europe. The aim of this study is to offer a perspective on
   the issue of fire impact on grasslands, by overviewing published
   information and practical experiences from Hungary. Our results suggest
   that fire can be detrimental for several taxa (e.g. insects or
   ground-dwelling birds), but can also promote population growth of
   several endangered species by reducing litter or by creating and
   maintaining open habitats. We also found that fire may be effective in
   controlling invasive plant species. The effect of fire on grassland
   biodiversity may be rather context-dependent. There is a critical need
   for developing robust evidences on the context-dependence of fire effect
   on biodiversity. For this, well designed prescribed burning experiments
   are crucial.}},

Pages = {{570-579}},
Abstract = {{We report on the effects of broad-scale restoration treatments on the
   ground layer of eucalypt grassy woodland in south-eastern Australia. The
   experiment was conducted in two conservation reserves from which
   livestock grazing had previously been removed. Changes in biomass,
   species diversity, ground-cover attributes and life-form were analysed
   over a 4-year period in relation to the following experimental
   interventions: (1) reduced kangaroo density, (2) addition of coarse
   woody debris and (3) fire (a single burn). Reducing kangaroo density
   doubled total biomass in one reserve, but no effects on exotic biomass,
   species counts or ground cover attributes were observed. Coarse woody
   debris also promoted biomass, particularly exotic annual forbs, as well
   as plant diversity in one of the reserves. The single burn reduced
   biomass, but changed little else. Overall, we found the main driver of
   change to be the favourable growth seasons that had followed a period of
   drought. This resulted in biomass increasing by 67\%, (mostly owing to
   the growth of perennial native grasses), whereas overall native species
   counts increased by 18\%, and exotic species declined by 20\% over the
   4-year observation period. Strategic management of grazing pressure, use
   of fire where biomass has accumulated and placement of coarse woody
   debris in areas of persistent erosion will contribute to improvements in
   soil and vegetation condition, and gains in biodiversity, in the future.}},

Title = {{Are shrubs really a sign of declining ecosystem function? Disentangling
   the myths and truths of woody encroachment in Australia}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{594-608}},
Abstract = {{Since European settlement, there has been a dramatic increase in the
   density, cover and distribution of woody plants in former grassland and
   open woodland. There is a widespread belief that shrub encroachment is
   synonymous with declines in ecosystem functions, and often it is
   associated with landscape degradation or desertification. Indeed, this
   decline in ecosystem functioning is considered to be driven largely by
   the presence of the shrubs themselves. This prevailing paradigm has been
   the basis for an extensive program of shrub removal, based on the view
   that it is necessary to reinstate the original open woodland or
   grassland structure from which shrublands are thought to have been
   derived. We review existing scientific evidence, particularly focussed
   on eastern Australia, to question the notion that shrub encroachment
   leads to declines in ecosystem functions. We then summarise this
   scientific evidence into two conceptual models aimed at optimising
   landscape management to maximise the services provided by
   shrub-encroached areas. The first model seeks to reconcile the apparent
   conflicts between the patch- and landscape-level effects of shrubs. The
   second model identifies the ecosystem services derived from different
   stages of shrub encroachment. We also examined six ecosystem services
   provided by shrublands (biodiversity, soil C, hydrology, nutrient
   provision, grass growth and soil fertility) by using published and
   unpublished data. We demonstrated the following: (1) shrub effects on
   ecosystems are strongly scale-, species- and environment-dependent and,
   therefore, no standardised management should be applied to every case;
   (2) overgrazing dampens the generally positive effect of shrubs, leading
   to the misleading relationship between encroachment and degradation; (3)
   woody encroachment per se does not hinder any of the functions or
   services described above, rather it enhances many of them; (4) no single
   shrub-encroachment state (including grasslands without shrubs) will
   maximise all services; rather, the provision of ecosystem goods and
   services by shrublands requires a mixture of different states; and (5)
   there has been little rigorous assessment of the long-term effectiveness
   of removal and no evidence that this improves land condition in most
   cases. Our review provides the basis for an improved, scientifically

Abstract = {{Grassland managers and scientists are increasingly interested in
   cost-effective alternative ways of grassland biodiversity conservation.
   Prescribed burning is a promising management tool which should be
   integrated in the planning of management efforts. In addition,
   small-scale prescribed burning is an effective fire suppression strategy
   to decrease the serious negative impacts of uncontrolled burnings on
   ecosystems and human life. Prescribed burning forms an integral part of
   the North-American grassland management practice, while in Europe it is
   rarely applied, despite the fact that uncontrolled burning occurs
   frequently in some regions. Our goal was to evaluate the use of
   prescribed burning as a promising but neglected management tool in
   European grasslands. We found that European studies on prescribed
   burning of grasslands are scarce and we conclude that annual burning is
   usually not an appropriate option for the conservation of species-rich
   grasslands. We reviewed burning studies from North-America to identify
   findings which might be adapted to the European grassland conservation
   strategy. In North-America, contrary to Europe, the application of
   burning is fine tuned in terms of frequency and timing, and usually
   combined with other restoration measures (grazing or seed sowing). Thus,
   we conclude that with the application of carefully designed prescribed
   burning, multiple conservation goals, e. g. invasion control and
   enhancing landscape-level heterogeneity, can be linked with an effective
   fire suppression strategy. We emphasize that for the application of
   prescribed burning in Europe, the general findings of carefully designed
   case studies should be combined with the practical knowledge of
   conservation managers concerning the local application circumstances to
   reach specific management objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing, fire, and climate shape mesic grassland communities. With
   global change altering all three factors, understanding how grasslands
   respond to changes in these combined drivers may aid in projecting
   future changes in grassland ecosystems. We manipulated rainfall and
   simulated grazing (clipping) in two long-term fire experiments in mesic
   grasslands in North America (NA) and South Africa (SA). Despite their
   common drivers, grasslands in NA and SA differ in evolutionary history.
   Therefore, we expected community structure and production in NA and SA
   to respond differently to fire, grazing, and drought. Specifically, we
   hypothesized that NA plant community composition and production would be
   more responsive than the SA plant communities to changes in the drivers
   and their interactions, and that despite this expected stability of SA
   grasslands, drought would be the dominant factor controlling production,
   but grazing would play the primary role in determining community
   composition at both sites. Contrary to our hypothesis, NA and SA
   grasslands generally responded similarly to grazing, drought, and fire.
   Grazing increased diversity, decreased grass cover and production, and
   decreased belowground biomass at both sites. Drought alone minimally
   impacted plant community structure, and we saw similar treatment
   interactions at the two sites. Drought was not the primary driver of
   grassland productivity, but instead drought effects were similar to or
   less than grazing and fire. Even though these grasslands differed in
   evolutionary history, they responded similarly to our fire, grazing, and
   climate manipulations. Overall, we found community and ecosystem
   convergence in NA and SA grasslands. Grazing and fire are as important
   as climate in controlling mesic grassland ecosystems on both continents.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding trophic linkages within the soil food web (SFW) is
   hampered by its opacity, diversity, and limited niche adaptation. We
   need to expand our insight between the feeding guilds of fauna and not
   just count biodiversity. The soil fauna drive nutrient cycling and play
   a pivotal, but little understood role within both the carbon (C) and
   nitrogen (N) cycles that may be ecosystem dependent. Here, we define the
   structure of the SFW in two habitats (grassland and woodland) on the
   same soil type and test the hypothesis that land management would alter
   the SFW in these habitats. To do this, we census the community structure
   and use stable isotope analysis to establish the pathway of C and N
   through each trophic level within the ecosystems. Stable isotope ratios
   of C and N from all invertebrates were used as a proxy for trophic
   niche, and community-wide metrics were obtained. Our empirically derived
   C/N ratios differed from those previously reported, diverging from model
   predictions of global C and N cycling, which was unexpected. An
   assessment of the relative response of the different functional groups
   to the change from agricultural grassland to woodland was performed.
   This showed that abundance of herbivores, microbivores, and
   micropredators were stimulated, while omnivores and macropredators were
   inhibited in the grassland. Differences between stable isotope ratios
   and community-wide metrics, highlighted habitats with similar taxa had
   different SFWs, using different basal resources, either driven by root
   or litter derived resources. Overall, we conclude that plant type can
   act as a top-down driver of community functioning and that differing
   land management can impact on the whole SFW.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Ecologists recognize that fire and herbivory are essential to
   maintaining habitat quality in grassland ecosystems. Prescribed fire and
   grazing are typically used on public reserves to increase biodiversity,
   improve grassland productivity, and control encroachment of woody
   plants. However, these tools, particularly prescribed fire, have not
   been widely adopted by private landowners. Fire suppression and
   prescribed fire are strategies that present competing risks to owners
   who make management decisions. We explore landowner perceptions of risk
   associated with (1) eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana)
   encroachment, and (2) the use of prescribed fire to control woody
   species in the Grand River Grasslands of Iowa and Missouri, USA. We
   found that although mapping data of eastern redcedar in this region
   showed substantial encroachment over the past three decades, concept
   mapping of landowner beliefs and in-person interviews of local community
   leaders revealed that perceived risks associated with prescribed fire
   often outweighed those associated with loss of forage and grassland
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Environmental degradation resulting from desertification often
   accelerates biodiversity loss and alters carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
   stocks within grassland ecosystem. In order to evaluate the effect of
   desertification on plant diversity and carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
   stocks, species compositions and C and N contents in plants and soil
   were investigated along five regions with different degrees of
   desertification in the northeastern margin of the Qinghai-Tibetan
   Plateau (control, light, moderate, severe and very severe stages). The
   study showed: (1) species composition and richness changed significantly
   with the development of grassland desertification; (2) the aboveground
   biomass C and N contents in the control were 101.60 and 4.03 g m(-2),
   respectively. Compared to the control, the aboveground tissue C and N
   contents significantly decreased from light, moderate, severe to very
   severe stages. (3) The root C and N contents in the control in 0-40 cm
   depth are 1,372.83 and 31.49 g m(-2), respectively, while the root C and
   N contents in 0-40 cm were also declining from the control, light,
   moderate, severe to very severe stages. (4) Compared to the plant, the
   soil made a greater contribution for C and N distribution, in which the
   soil organic C and total N contents in 0-40 cm depth in the control are
   20,386.70 and 3,587.89 g m(-2), respectively. At the same time, soil
   organic C and N contents also decreased significantly from the control
   to very severe stages. These results suggest that grassland
   desertification not only alters species compositions and leads to the
   loss of plant diversity, but also results in greater loss of organic C
   and N in alpine meadow, in which there is a negative effect on reducing
   greenhouse gas emission.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate the changes in both vascular plant and
   carabid beetle assemblages in response to reducing the intensity of
   management of park lawns in the city of Helsinki. Three levels of mowing
   were applied to patches of previously managed park lawns: (1)
   intensively mown, (2) mown until the previous season and unmanaged
   since, and (3) unmanaged for ten years (benign neglect). The lawns were
   dominated by plants that disperse vegetatively. This treatment gradient
   had little or no effect on the flight capability, feeding type or
   body-size of carabid beetles. However, there was an increase in species
   richness and the numbers of stenotopic species in the benign neglect
   treatment. We conclude that benign neglect of open grassland vegetation
   will result in higher levels of biodiversity than in more intensely
   managed vegetation. However, we consider it likely that the optimal
   strategy for maintaining urban biodiversity would be to apply a meadow
   management regime of mowing once or twice per year and leaving some
   areas of unmanaged grassland to maintain habitat heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland ecosystems worldwide not only provide many important ecosystem
   services but they also function as a major source of the greenhouse gas
   nitrous oxide (N2O), especially in response to nitrogen deposition by
   grazing animals. To explore the role of plants as mediators of these
   emissions, we tested whether and how N2O emissions are dependent on
   grass species richness and/or specific grass species composition in the
   absence and presence of urine deposition. We hypothesized that: (i) N2O
   emissions relate negatively to plant productivity; (ii) four-species
   mixtures have lower emissions than monocultures (as they are expected to
   be more productive); (iii) emissions are lowest in combinations of
   species with diverging root morphology and high root biomass; and (iv)
   the identity of the key species that reduce N2O emissions is dependent
   on urine deposition. We established monocultures and two- and
   four-species mixtures of common grass species with diverging functional
   traits: Lolium perenne L. (Lp), Festuca arundinacea Schreb. (Fa), Phleum
   pratense L. (Php) and Poa trivialis L. (Pt), and quantified N2O
   emissions for 42days. We found no relation between plant species
   richness and N2O emissions. However, N2O emissions were significantly
   reduced in specific plant species combinations. In the absence of urine,
   plant communities of Fa+Php acted as a sink for N2O, whereas the
   monocultures of these species constituted a N2O source. With urine
   application Lp+Pt plant communities reduced (P<0.001) N2O emissions by
   44\% compared to monocultures of Lp. Reductions in N2O emissions by
   species mixtures could be explained by total biomass productivity and by
   complementarity in root morphology. This study shows that plant species
   composition is a key component underlying N2O emissions from grassland
   ecosystems. Selection of specific grass species combinations in the
   context of the expected nitrogen deposition regimes may therefore
   provide a key for mitigation of N2O emissions.}},

Title = {{Rainfall variability has minimal effects on grassland recovery from
   repeated grazing}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{36-44}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{QuestionMesic grasslands experience a complex disturbance regime
   including frequent fire, grazing by large ungulates and strong
   inter-annual climate variability. As a result of climate change, growing
   season precipitation regimes are predicted to become more variable, with
   larger event sizes and longer dry periods resulting in more temporally
   dynamic soil moisture regimes. Increased climate variability is likely
   to interact with other disturbances, such as grazing, in grassland
   ecosystems. We investigated the individual and combined effects of
   increased rainfall variability and grazing on plant community
   composition, structure and function in an annually burned, native
   tallgrass prairie. Our overarching question was: are grazing impacts
   modified under a more variable precipitation regime?
   LocationKonza Prairie, Kansas, USA.
   MethodsPlots were established within a long-term rainfall manipulation
   experiment in which larger, but less frequent, rain events were imposed
   during the growing season without altering the total rain amount. We
   then simulated intense grazing pressure during one growing season by
   repeatedly clipping all graminoids to 5cm and monitored recovery over
   3yr.
   ResultsNeither grazing nor rainfall treatments affected species
   richness; however, grazing decreased total and grass above-ground net
   primary production (ANPP) and increased forb ANPP relative to ungrazed
   plots. Grass stem density recovered from intense grazing under ambient
   rainfall but did not fully recover, even after 2yr in the altered
   rainfall treatment.
   ConclusionsWe found that increased rainfall variability had little
   effect on tallgrass prairie structure and function, while grazing had
   large effects. Grazing and increased rainfall variability interacted to
   suppress grass stem density and delayed recovery relative to controls.
   Although stem density was reduced, individual stem size increased,
   resulting in no net change in ANPP. This suggests that ANPP in grazed
   and ungrazed North American tallgrass prairie may be relatively
   resilient under more temporally variable precipitation regimes.}},

Title = {{The influence of feral horses dung piles on surrounding vegetation}},
Journal = {{MANAGEMENT OF BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{73-79}},
Abstract = {{The effect of grazing by large herbivores on grassland communities has
   been extensively studied, however less is known about changes associated
   with sites of high-intensity activity, such as dust bowls, tracks, urine
   patches and dung piles, that might induce disproportionate impacts to
   the directly affected areas and the surrounding vegetation. This paper
   explores the changes associated with exotic feral horse dung piles in
   relicts of natural grasslands in Argentine Pampas. We expected greater
   changes in the composition of plant communities and a greater
   facilitation effect on the establishment of invasive alien plants
   adjacent to the dung piles. Characteristics of the vegetation
   surrounding dung piles were recorded in 100 x 25 cm plots located 0-1.5
   m from the edge of the piles. We compared the immediate surroundings
   with reference plots at 5 m. The diversity of plant species increased as
   distance from the edge increased from 0-1.5 m; however, species richness
   was significantly higher in the first meter next to dung piles than 5 m
   away. Percentage cover of bare ground decreased further from the dung
   piles at both scales. Percentage cover of woody plants was greater at
   greater distances from the manure, whereas percentage cover of exotic
   plants was significantly higher next to the dung piles. The reported
   changes could be related to concentration gradients of nutrients
   liberated from the manure and/or to behaviour patterns of the horses,
   which may avoid grazing in the immediate surroundings of dung piles.
   These changes result in invasion windows facilitating the establishment
   and subsequent dispersal of exotic plant species in grasslands.}},

Journal = {{MIRES AND PEAT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Abstract = {{Peatlands represent one of the most important water resources in the
   Puna grassland ecoregion, but this fact is not yet widely recognised.
   Puna peatlands also provide key environmental services such as
   increasing the regional biodiversity of the Andean Altiplano plateau and
   contributing to the wellbeing of high-altitude human populations by
   providing grazing land and cooking fuel. We conducted a study in the
   Peruvian Puna ecoregion to describe the current condition of peatlands
   in terms of their vegetation, physical and chemical characteristics and
   disturbance status. Our results suggest that peat thickness, organic
   matter and degree of humification are good indicators for identifying
   peatlands in the Puna ecoregion. In general, the peatland sites that we
   sampled were dominated by mixtures of cushion and acaulescent rosette
   forming plants such as Distichia muscoides Nees \& Meyen and Plantago
   tubulosa Decne. These Distichia and Plantago peatland sites were
   characterised by a mean surface water pH of 6.3, corrected electrical
   conductivity (K corr.) in the range 300-1814 mu S cm(-1) and presented
   the following mean exchangeable cation values: Ca2+ 48 mg L-1, Mg2+ 9.6
   mg L-1, Na+ 8.2 mg L-1 and K+ 2.1 mg L-1. The most common causes of
   disturbance we encountered were grazing, peat extraction and roads.
   Disturbance was most severe in mining sites, where peatlands are
   especially vulnerable because they are not under legal protection.}},

Journal = {{ORNIS FENNICA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{231-243}},
Abstract = {{After circa 35 years of drainage and intensive arable tillage, the lower
   Skjern River, Denmark was re-engineered to its original meanders and
   flooding regime, creating 22 km(2) of lakes, shallow wetlands and
   seasonally flooded grazed wet grassland costing {[}SIC]38 million. The
   primary motivation was to restore the sediment/nutrient retention
   capacity of the river valley to reduce eutrophication of Ringkobing
   Fjord at its efflux. Secondary objectives were to (i) restore breeding
   and staging bird habitat, (ii) enhance the self-sustaining Atlantic
   Salmon Salmo salar population and (iii) improve recreational and tourist
   activities. Despite lack of specific success criteria, breeding
   waterbird numbers increased from 134 +/- 22.9 SE (n = 3) pairs before to
   1,744 +/- 153 SE (n = 5) after restoration (although on average 1,004 of
   these were Black-headed Gulls Chroicocephalus ridibundus), species
   richness and diversity also increased. Twenty-nine waterbird species
   returned to breed, 10 of national or international significance (Danish
   Red List/European Union Birds Directive Annex 1 species) now ranking
   Skjern River amongst the top 10 most important breeding waterbird sites
   in Denmark. Currently, agriculture supports cost-neutral management of
   the restoration area, but whilst most expected wet meadow and marsh
   species had returned, lack of goal-orientated management targets
   resulted in some additional rare and threatened species remaining
   absent. Breeding pair density and diversity of other species could have
   been greatly improved by prior planning and management intervention but
   at additional cost.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the influence of the use of methods of Molinia
   meadows in eastern Poland on changes in its biodiversity and species
   composition. Research was carried out in 2006-10 on Molinia meadows near
   Usciwierz lake, located in the Pojezierze Leczynsko-Wlodawskie (Lake

   1. 1-cut meadow (June), 2. 1-cut meadow (June) + grazing (August), 3.
   abandoned meadow (since 2000). The above-mentioned methods of use caused
   the transformation of the typical structure of Selino-Molinietum meadow.

Abstract = {{The occurrence of interstitial species in Astrebla grasslands in
   Australia are influenced by grazing and seasonal rainfall but the
   interactions of these two influences are complex. This paper describes
   three studies aimed at determining and explaining the changes in plant
   species richness and abundance of the interstitial species in a
   long-term sheep utilisation experiment in an Astrebla grassland in
   northern Queensland. In the first study, increasing utilisation
   increased the frequency of Dactyloctenium radulans (Button grass) and
   Brachyachne convergens (Downs couch) and reduced that of Streptoglossa
   adscendens (Mint bush). In the second study, seasonal rainfall variation
   between 1984 and 2009 resulted in large annual differences in the size
   of the seed banks of many species, but increasing utilisation
   consistently reduced the seed bank of species such as Astrebla spp. and
   S. adscendens and increased that of species such as B. convergens, D.
   radulans, Amaranthus mitchellii (Boggabri) and Boerhavia sp. (Tar vine).
   In the third study, the highest species richness occurred at the
   lightest utilisation because of the presence of a range of palatable
   forbs, especially legumes. Species richness was reduced as utilisation
   increased. Species richness in the grazing exclosure was low and similar
   to that at the heaviest utilisation where there was a reduction in the
   presence of palatable forb species. The pattern of highest species
   richness at the lightest grazing treatment was maintained across three
   sampling times, even with different amounts of seasonal rainfall, but
   there was a large yearly variation in both the density and frequency of
   many species. It was concluded that the maintenance of highest species
   richness at the lightest utilisation was not aligned with other data
   from this grazing experiment which indicated that the maximum
   sustainable wool production occurred at moderate utilisation.}},

Abstract = {{This research was conducted mainly in the riparian and stream forest in
   northern Togo protected areas. It aims to assess and to describe trees'
   biodiversity especially those of riparian forest including their tree
   plant community structure assessment. It also aims to find out the
   environmental factor which influences the species distribution. In that
   regard, 170 forest plots were set in the whole zone to identify the
   major vegetation types via the ordination analysis (detrended
   correspondence analysis). For this step, four types of wood vegetation
   were described. After that, the study was focused on the riparian
   ecosystem where 62 forest plots were setup along the rivers Koumongou,
   Gambara and Komkoumbou. This new batch of data was subjected to
   floristic analysis, structure (diameter and height) correlation analysis
   and spatial analysis of human activities. The results showed that 61
   tree species belonged to 25 families in the riparian forest. The species
   were absolutely dominated by mesophanerophytes, microphanerophytes,
   Sudano-Zambezian and Sudanian species. In spite of its destruction and
   degradation which is observed in the places with high human pressure,
   the riparian forest still presents a stable growth based on the
   structure feature. Fabaccae, Combretaccae, Rubiaceae, Anacardiaceae, and
   Moraceae were listed as important families in the areas, but this
   potential floristic resource was almost threatened by activities such as
   farming, pasture, burning, and tree cutting. The ecological restoration
   of the bank is needed through the program of participative
   afforestation, and re-vegetation of the destroyed zone by native species
   in short term; and implemented with a global plan of conservation of
   this endangered ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine grassland flora (Tab. 2) and
   vegetation, and frequency of occurrence of woody and herbaceous species
   of the forest edge at different grassland management localities (Tab. 6,
   see Tab. 5). The field research of flora and grassland vegetation
   (2008-2010) was conducted at 27 localities (Tab. 1, Fig.1). A total of
   103 releves using the Braun-Blanquet (1964) method amounting to 100 m(2)
   was made, while the description of habitats included geographical
   coordinates, altitude, inclination, exposure, land forms, and grassland
   management.
   Woody species and herbaceous transgressive species from the
   Trifolio-Geranietea sanguinea class (according to Kaligaric 1997) were
   selected from the releves (Vitasovi6 Kosic 2011) and are hereinafter
   referred to as ``herbaceous species of the forest edge{''}. The presence
   and frequency of each taxon in relation to the type of grassland
   management were determined. For each taxon, Braun-Blanquet's values were
   calculated as percentage of ground cover (\%) on a particular grassland
   type and classified according to grassland management type. From a total
   of 103 releves, 35 releves were abandoned pastures (NP), 23 releves
   abandoned meadows (NL), 20 releves used pastures (KP) and 25 releves
   used meadows (KL). The diversity of environmental grassland parameters
   and grassland management type was determined using modified Ellenberg
   indicator values (EIV) adjusted for the Mediterranean (Pignatti et al.
   2005). The descriptive statistical analysis of environmental variables
   (Box \& Whiskers diagrams) was conducted using the STATISTICA software
   package (StatSoft Inc. 2005).
   A total of 624 plant taxa classified in 275 genera and 62 families was
   recorded whereas the top six families according to number of taxa
   (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Poaceae, Lam iaceae, Liliaceae and Rosaceae)
   encompassed more than half (51.28 \%) of the total recorded flora (Tab.
   3).
   According to phytogeographical analysis (Tab. 4), the nearly equal
   representation of the Mediterranean floral, element (31.15 \%) and
   Eurasian floral element (29.97 \%) indicated that the studied area is
   located at the tran: sition between the sub-Mediterranean and
   Mediterranean-mountain vegetation belt. Prevalent life forms include
   hemicryptophytes (53.83 \%), which are typical for the grassland flora
   of pastures and meadows and indicate anthropogenic influence reflected
   in the form of grazing and burning. The relatively high prevalence of
   woody plants in the grassland habitats (N and P, 5.59 \%) indicated
   processes of succession at some of the localities (Fig. 2).
   The Cicarija grasslands belong mostly to the
   Scorzonero-Chrysopogonetalia order (pastures) and partially to the
   Arrhenatheretalia order (meadows) (Poldini 1989, Kaligaric 1997, Poldini
   \& Kaligari6 1997, Vitasovic Kosic. et al. 2011, 2012). A syntaxonomical
   interpretation of these associations is shown below.
   From the total flora, 35 woody species (5.61 \%) and 74 herbaceous
   species of the forest edge (11.86 \%) from the class Trifolio-Geranietea
   sanguinei were singled out, indicating processes of vegetation
   succession at some of the localities (Tab. 5, Tab. 6). Among the
   endangered species, Gentiana symphyandra (EN) and the vulnerable Lilium
   bulbiferum (VU) should be noted.
   According to grassland management, the largest number of woody and
   herbaceous species of the forest edge was detected within abandoned
   areas: NP - 58 taxa and NL - 28 species, while the used areas KL\_(16
   taxa) and KP (7 species) contained significantly less.
   The analysis of ecological indicator values (EIV) for woody and
   herbaceous species of forest edges (Fig. 3) showed that KP distinguished
   among the grassland management types, as can be seen by EIV nutrients,
   continentality, and light. Used pastures are generally homes to species
   that grow in poor soil nutrients (e.g., Genista sylvestris and Inula
   hirta), subcontinental (e.g., Asparagus tenuifolius), and continental
   species (e.g., Chamaecytisus hirsutus). As for the EIV of light, used
   pastures have more half-shade species, some of which cannot grow under
   full light (e.g., Helleborus multifidus subsp. istriacus). Contrary are
   used meadows where generally full-light species appear (Orobanche minor,
   Scabiosa columbaria, Rhinanthus aristatatus, etc.).
   It is known that grassland management acts as a driving force in the
   diversity of the plant community (MacDonald et al. 2000, Kahmen et al.
   2002, Wilson et al. 2003). During the last six decades, the abandonment
   of the traditional way of raising sheep resulted in different succession
   changes and significantly influenced biodiversity (Zupancic and Zagar
   2002, de Bello et al. 2007). The main overgrowth of vegetation occurred
   in the contact zones between inadequately mowed and grazing plots. Other
   means of spreading woody species may include forest edges and shrub
   communities that occur as a phase in the very dynamic process of
   re-overgrowth, which most often has an anthropogenic origin (Carni et
   al. 2002).
   Immediately after a plot ceases to be mowed or used for grazing, the
   occurrence of a high percentage of successional species is almost
   instant (Poldini 1989, Kaligaric \& Poldini 1997, see Tab. 6). Due to
   the low usage intensity of grasslands, the colonizing grass Brachypodium
   rupestre spread across the entire plot (Catorci et al., 2011, 2012). In
   this study B. rupestre appeared at a large frequency (<40 \%) on KL and
   KP, and with an even greater frequency (>40 \%) on NL and NP (see Tab.
   5, compare Vitasovk Kosk et al. 2012). The occurrence of B. rupestre in
   Cicarija is consistent with several studies, all of which emphasize the
   role of B. pinnatum and B. rupestre in the invasion of unmanaged
   grasslands through processes of competition and related problems of
   conservation (During \& Willems 1984, Bobbink \& Willems 1987).
   According to Grime (1973, 2001), B. rupestre possesses dominant features
   such as large size, strong vegetative reproductive capacity (with marked
   lateral spreading), growth from basal meristems (Stebbins 1972), and
   high phytomass production (Catorci et al. 2012). Moreover, its
   silica-rich leaves render this species poorly palatable for sheep (Grime
   et al. 1988), thus enabling the formation of a large amount of plant
   litter and a consequent decrease in floristic diversity (Bonanomi and
   Allegrezza 2004; Bonanomi et al. 2009).
   Under-grazing and irregular mowing (i.e., low disturbance) lead to the
   floristic homogenization of a system (Vitasovk Kosk et al. 2011), which
   ultimately leads to a reduction in plant diversity. Meadows are
   subjected to the invasion of B. rupestre to a larger extent and, as
   stated by Bennie etal. (2006), they are more vulnerable to the loss of
   floristic diversity than pastures after regular management ceases. For
   this reason, regular mowing should be maintained and intensified. As for
   dry pastures, a solution for more efficient management could be in using
   very low selective herbivores, such as cows, donkeys or horses, for
   grazing.
   In conclusion, particular attention in the protection and preservation
   of grasslands should be given to certain management measures (grazing
   and mowing) in order to maintain biodiversity, prevent grassland
   succession, and maintain control of the spread of B. rupestre. The
   results of this research can provide the basis for the development of
   new management plans, which will require specific knowledge on the
   preservation of biodiversity, particularly in Special Protected Areas
   (SPA) within the Natura 2000 network.}},

Abstract = {{Impacts of invasion of a ligneous weed, Prosopis juliflora; in plant

   different ligneous plant composition with lower order seral species
   being dominant. In all landuses, Prosopis-invaded sites had more species
   richness, diversity, and evenness. However, increase in species richness
   was due to occurrence of more weedy species along with Prosopis
   juliflora. Even amongst the protected and undisturbed sites, dominance
   of late successional species, e.g., Acacia senegal, Maytenus emarginata,
   Ziziphus nummularia and Acacia nilotica, was less at sites with Prosopis
   juliflora than at sites without it. Density of Commiphora wightii, an

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 31}},
Abstract = {{In many grassland ecosystems, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are added
   to improve plant productivity, and the aboveground plant biomass is
   mowed and stored as hay for the bullamacow. Nutrient addition and mowing
   affect the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and most of the
   previous studies have primarily focused on their effects on
   macro-organisms, neglecting the responses of soil microbial communities.
   In this study, we examined the changes in three community attributes
   (abundance, richness, and composition) of the entire bacterial kingdom
   and 16 dominant bacterial phyla/classes in response to mowing, N
   addition, P addition, and their combinations, by conducting a 5-year
   experiment in a steppe ecosystem in Inner Mongolia, China. Overall, N
   addition had a greater effect than mowing and P addition on most of
   these bacterial groups, as indicated by changes in the abundance,
   richness and composition in response to these treatments. N addition
   affected these soil bacterial groups primarily through reducing soil pH
   and increasing available N content. Meanwhile, the 16 bacterial
   phyla/classes responded differentially to these experimental treatments,
   with Acidobacteria, Acidimicrobidae, Deltaproteobacteria, and
   Gammaproteobacteria being the most sensitive. The changes in the
   abundance, richness, and composition of various bacterial groups could
   imply some potential shift in their ecosystem functions. Furthermore,
   the important role of decreased soil pH caused by N addition in
   affecting soil bacterial communities suggests the importance of
   restoring acidified soil to maintain soil bacterial diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity in rangelands is decreasing, due to intense utilization for
   livestock production and conversion of rangeland into cropland; yet the
   outlook of rangeland biodiversity has not been considered in view of
   future global demand for food. Here we assess the impact of future
   livestock production on the global rangelands area and their
   biodiversity. First we formalized existing knowledge about livestock
   grazing impacts on biodiversity, expressed in mean species abundance
   (MSA) of the original rangeland native species assemblages, through
   metaanalysis of peer-reviewed literature. MSA values, ranging from 1 in
   natural rangelands to 0.3 in man-made grasslands, were entered in the
   IMAGE-GLOBIO model. This model was used to assess the impact of change
   in food demand and livestock production on future rangeland
   biodiversity. The model revealed remarkable regional variation in impact
   on rangeland area and MSA between two agricultural production scenarios.
   The area of used rangelands slightly increases globally between 2000 and
   2050 in the baseline scenario and reduces under a scenario of enhanced
   uptake of resource-efficient production technologies increasing
   production {[}high levels of agricultural knowledge, science, and
   technology (high-AKST)], particularly in Africa. Both scenarios suggest
   a global decrease in MSA for rangelands until 2050. The contribution of
   livestock grazing to MSA loss is, however, expected to diminish after
   2030, in particular in Africa under the high-AKST scenario. Policies
   fostering agricultural intensification can reduce the overall pressure
   on rangeland biodiversity, but additional measures, addressing factors
   such as climate change and infrastructural development, are necessary to
   totally halt biodiversity loss.}},

Title = {{Pastoral Practices to Reverse Shrub Encroachment of Sub-Alpine
   Grasslands: Dung Beetles (Coleoptera, Scarabaeoidea) Respond More
   Quickly Than Vegetation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, pastoral abandonment has produced profound ecological
   changes in the Alps. In particular, the reduction in grazing has led to
   extensive shrub encroachment of semi-natural grasslands, which may
   represent a threat to open habitat biodiversity. To reverse shrub
   encroachment, we assessed short-term effects of two different pastoral
   practices on vegetation and dung beetles (Coleoptera, Scarabaeoidea).
   Strategic placement of mineral mix supplements (MMS) and arrangement of
   temporary night camp areas (TNCA) for cattle were carried out during
   summer 2011 in the Val Troncea Natural Park, north-western Italian Alps.
   In 2012, one year after treatment, a reduction in shrub cover and an
   increase in bare ground cover around MMS sites was detected. A more
   intense effect was detected within TNCA through increases in forage
   pastoral value, and in the cover and height of the herbaceous layer.
   Immediately after treatment, changes in dung beetle diversity (total
   abundance, species richness, Shannon diversity, taxonomic and functional
   diversity) showed a limited disturbance effect caused by high cattle
   density. In contrast, dung beetle diversity significantly increased one
   year later both at MMS and TNCA sites, with a stronger effect within
   TNCA. Multivariate Regression Trees and associated Indicator Value
   analyses showed that some ecologically relevant dung beetle species
   preferred areas deprived of shrub vegetation. Our main conclusions are:
   i) TNCA are more effective than MMS in terms of changes to vegetation
   and dung beetles, ii) dung beetles respond more quickly than vegetation
   to pastoral practices, and iii) the main driver of the rapid response by
   dung beetles is the removal of shrubs. The resulting increase in dung
   beetle abundance and diversity, which are largely responsible for
   grassland ecosystem functioning, may have a positive effect on
   meso-eutrophic grassland restoration. Shrub encroachment in the Alps may
   therefore be reversed, and restoration of grassland enhanced, by using
   appropriate pastoral practices.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{310}},
Pages = {{234-241}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{A substantial part of European lowland woodlands was managed as coppices
   or wood pastures for millennia. However, traditional management forms
   were almost completely abandoned in Central Europe by the middle of the
   20th century. Combined with the effects of nitrogen deposition and
   herbivore pressure, shifts in management resulted in biodiversity loss
   affecting particularly light-demanding oligotrophic plant species.
   Experimental thinning was applied in a former oak coppice-with-standards
   in an attempt to restore vanishing understorey plant communities. Two
   levels of thinning intensity and zero management as control were used on
   90 plots. Ten years after the treatment, significant changes in species
   composition and diversity were observed in heavily thinned plots, while
   moderate thinning had mostly insignificant effects. Light-demanding
   oligotrophic species significantly increased, indicating positive
   consequences of restoration. However, heavy thinning also brought about
   the expansion of native ruderal species. Alien species remained
   unchanged. We conclude that the restoration of coppice-with-standards
   can be an efficient tool to support vanishing light-demanding woodland
   species. Combined with biodiversity benefits, the increasing demand for
   biofuel may contribute to the renaissance of traditional management
   forms in forestry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the effects of livestock grazing on vegetation and small
   mammals in semiarid habitat at a site in northeastern Nevada. Habitat
   within a fenced exclosure that had been protected from grazing for more
   than 50 years supported more vegetation and had greater plant diversity
   compared to habitat immediately outside the exclosure. Likewise, species
   richness and abundance of small mammals were greater in ungrazed areas.
   Results suggest that grazing regulation in recent decades may account
   for some of the changes seen in regional plants and small mammals over
   the past century. The incorporation of long-term exclosures in a
   comparative framework permits differentiation of the direct effects of
   grazing on biotic communities and thus provides a reference point for
   assessing the influence of grazing relative to other factors in the
   interpretation of historical change.}},

Abstract = {{The capybara, Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris (L.) (Rodentia: Caviidae), is
   the largest herbivorous rodent on Earth and abundant in the Neotropical
   region, which can provide a stable food source of dung for dung beetle
   communities (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae). However, the use
   of capybara dung by dung beetles is poorly known. Here, we present data
   on the structure of the dung beetle community attracted to capybara dung
   and compare with the community attracted to human feces. Dung beetles
   were captured with pitfall traps baited with fresh capybara dung and
   human feces in pastures with exotic grass (Brachiaria spp.), patches of
   Brazilian savanna (Cerrado), and points of degraded riparian vegetation
   along the Aquidauana river in Anastacio and Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do
   Sul, Brazil. In traps baited with human feces, 13,809 individuals of 31
   species were captured, and in those baited with capybara dung 1,027
   individuals belonging to 26 species were captured. The average number of
   individuals and species captured by the traps baited with human feces
   was greater than for capybara dung in all habitats studied. Composition
   of the communities attracted to human feces and capybara dung formed
   distinct groups in all habitats. Despite the smaller number of species
   and individuals captured in capybara dung when compared with human
   feces, capybara dung was attractive to dung beetles. In Brazil, the
   legalization of hunting these rodents has been debated, which would
   potentially affect the community and consequently the ecological
   functions performed by dung beetles that use the feces of these animals
   as a resource. In addition, the knowledge of the communities associated
   with capybaras may be important in predicting the consequences of future
   management of their populations.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands are widely recognized for their high ecological
   value. They often count among the most species-rich habitats, especially
   in traditional cultural landscapes. Maintaining and/or restoring them is
   atop priority, but nevertheless represents a real conservation
   challenge, especially regarding their invertebrate assemblages. The main
   goal of this study was to experimentally investigate the influence of
   four different mowing regimes on orthopteran communities and
   populations: (1) control meadow (C-meadow): mowing regime according to
   the Swiss regulations for extensively managed meadows declared as
   ecological compensation areas, i.e. first cut not before 15 June; (2)
   first cut not before 15 July (delayed treatment, D-meadow); (3) first
   cut not before 15 June and second cut not earlier than 8 weeks from the
   first cut (8W-meadow); (4) refuges left uncut on 10-20\% of the meadow
   area (R-meaddw). Data were collected two years after the introduction of
   these mowing treatments. Orthopteran densities from spring to early
   summer were five times higher in D-meadows, compared to C-meadows. In
   R-meadows, densities were, on average, twice as high as in C-meadows,
   while mean species richness was 23\% higher in R-meadows than in
   C-meadows. Provided that farmers were given the appropriate financial
   incentives, the D- and R-meadow regimes could be relatively easy to
   implement within agri-environment schemes. Such meadows could deliver
   substantial benefits for functional biodiversity, including sustenance
   to many secondary consumers dependent on field invertebrates as staple
   food. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Management intensification in agricultural grasslands is a major
   conservation concern. During the last 50 years, meadows have been
   drained, re-seeded with high-yielding grasses, treated with chemicals to
   remove pests and promote rapid growth, and mowing has become earlier and
   more frequent. This has severely reduced the reproductive success of
   several meadow-nesting bird species across large areas of Europe,
   causing population declines. Corn buntings Emberiza calandra have been
   excluded from nesting in meadows across much of north-western Europe by
   earlier mowing and tend to persist only in later-harvested cereal crops.
   However, in areas where meadow-nesting persists, adjustment of mowing
   dates supported by agri-environment schemes could still be a critical
   conservation measure for remaining populations. Using trial conservation
   interventions, we tested the relationship between delayed mowing and
   reproductive success across 19 mixed arable/grassland farms in the main
   remaining range of corn buntings in Scotland, over five breeding
   seasons. Corn buntings require around five weeks from nest building to
   fledging, and in Scotland start nesting during mid-May-June. Delayed
   mowing to 1 August (6-8 weeks after the mean first egg date of first
   nesting attempts in meadows) significantly increased the probability of
   a brood fledging (0.282, compared with 0.034 in fields mown in June or
   July), with a potential population-wide effect of raising overall
   breeding productivity across all crop types by 20\%. To reach the level
   required for population stability (1 successful brood per female), we
   estimate that at least 40-50\% of the nests in meadows must be in fields
   with delayed mowing. With effective targeting, this could be achieved by
   delayed mowing in just 10-20\% of meadows (260-520 ha throughout the
   species' northeast Scotland range), at a cost of 100 pound 000-160 pound
   000 per year. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional cattle ranching in Latin America has been based mostly on
   extensive pasture monocultures planted with minimum tree cover. The
   current trend towards replacing treeless pastures with silvopastoral
   systems that include tree and shrub species enhances productivity and
   provides environmental services within these systems. We studied the ant
   fauna in cattle farms at La Vieja river basin, Colombia, with the aim of
   analyzing the relations between tree cover and ant species diversity and
   composition in different land uses in this cattle-dominated landscape.
   Monitoring was performed between 2004 and 2007 in 21 plots representing
   seven contrasting land uses characteristic of this Andean landscape.
   Ants were sampled with baits (arboreal and ground) and pitfall traps. A
   total of 68,860 individuals belonging to 227 ant species was recorded.
   Ant diversity was positively related to the presence of woody
   vegetation. The largest number of ant species was found in secondary
   forests followed by improved pastures with trees. Pastures without trees
   had less than half the number of ant species in pastures with trees. Ant
   species richness in intensive Leucaena leucocephala (Mimosaceae)
   silvopastoral systems also surpassed that recorded in treeless pastures.
   This study provides evidence supporting the conservation value of
   silvopastoral systems at the landscape level in the Colombian Andes. The
   conservation of forest fragments in this area is vital, as they provide
   refuge for a unique regional ant fauna (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Over centuries traditional pasturing created a complex landscape
   structure, but few studies have compared amphibian communities in
   traditional pasture with those in natural landscapes. In our study we
   assessed the impact of traditional pasture use in the Pyrenean region of
   haft Forest. We also evaluated the relative importance of wetland and
   landscape features for amphibians. During 2010 and 2011, we monitored 45
   wetlands and recorded abiotic and biotic environmental variables and the
   features of the surrounding landscape. We recorded the occurrence of
   seven species of amphibians (Calotriton asper, Salamandra salamandra,
   Lissotriton helveticus, Bufo bufo, Alytes obstetricans, Rana pyrenaica
   and Rana temporaria); at least one amphibian was detected in 89\% of
   wetlands. Both wetland and landscape features explained a significant
   amount variation of community structure. The composition of amphibian
   communities was strongly affected by the surrounding landscape, S.
   salamandra being associated with the most forested areas, while B. bufo
   and C. asper dominate the communities within pasture areas. Community
   richness was not significantly related to the cover of forest or to the
   pasture cover in the surrounding landscape. Furthermore richness did not
   peak at intermediate levels of forest cover or of the cover of pasture.
   Traditional pastoral activities do not reduce amphibian biodiversity
   compared to natural landscapes, and allow environmental heterogeneity
   that is needed for certain amphibians in mountain areas.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation of natural habitats is a central concern of biodiversity
   conservation and is considered a significant factor contributing to
   species loss and populations decline. We studied this in Cotove
   Agricultural Center in the municipality of Santa Fe de Antioquia
   (Colombia),where the conversion of natural forests to different land use
   systems, has limited the amount of available habitat. With the aim to
   describe the effect of habitat loss on bird presence in five land uses
   (fruiting trees, silvopastoral systems, secondary forest, pasture low
   density of trees and grass cutting) in this area, we studied bird
   diversity using two methods: fixed point counts and mist nets to analyze
   the influence of land use in the composition, richness and abundance of
   birds present were studied. A total of 6 633 individuals of 101 species
   were observed of which 11 species were migratory. The insectivorous and
   frugivorous foraging guilds were better represented. The Shannon index
   indicated the highest values of alpha diversity for the silvopastoral
   system, and the fruit with the lowest. The grazing and silvopastoral
   land systems shared more species with low tree density. The importance
   of the environmental heterogeneity found is highlighted as a positive
   factor for bird species richness, mostly of low and middle habitat
   specificity, and preferably from edge habitats and open areas. In order
   to preserve natural regeneration and connectivity between different land
   use types, and to promote stability of bird species populations, some
   management actions should be implemented in the area.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{AimEfforts to evaluate the impact of non-native plants on ecosystems
   rarely consider the role of such plants in sustaining local food webs of
   arthropods, or whether the effect is similar across arthropod feeding
   guilds and life stages. We assess this response by comparing arthropod
   herbivores on native plants (species with evolutionary histories within
   local food webs) and non-native plants (species without such histories).
   We further compare the impact of non-native plants that are congeners of
   local native species with those of non-natives with no close local
   relatives.
   LocationSuburban landscapes, Mid-Atlantic United States (Delaware,
   Pennsylvania).
   MethodsWe manipulated the composition of the first trophic level by
   planting four large common gardens of 50 woody plant species replicated
   in time and space. After an establishment year, we sampled herbivorous
   arthropods supported by each plant species and classified them by
   herbivore species, feeding guild and life stage.
   ResultsWe found that (1) native plants support larger and more diverse
   herbivore communities, (2) arthropods with chewing mouthparts and
   immature herbivores were more sensitive to plant origin than arthropods
   with piercing-sucking mouthparts and adult herbivores, (3) arthropods
   laid more eggs on native plants, (4) internal feeders were rare on all
   non-native plants and (5) the reduction in herbivore populations on
   non-native plants was smaller, but still significant, if species had a
   close native relative.
   Main conclusionsNovel ecosystems comprised of plant species with no
   evolutionary history with local members of higher trophic levels may
   reduce the diversity and complexity of local food webs. Given the rate
   at which novel ecosystems are replacing coevolved plant communities
   worldwide, this result has global implications for the conservation of
   biodiversity. Using more native plants within human-dominated landscapes
   may help maintain the integrity of arthropod communities, as well as the
   populations of animals that consume arthropods.}},

Journal = {{FOURRAGES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{216}},
Pages = {{321-328}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In certain arid areas, where pastoralism remains vital, livestock
   pressure on rangeland can end up deteriorating this land. Managing
   rangelands in a sustainable way to feed livestock is therefore a crucial
   issue. This comparative study examines the evolution of vegetation in
   rangelands in the Dhahar (Tunisia) under 2 different management systems.
   In this study, some of the land was overgrazed (continuous grazing at a
   stocking rate of 2 heads/ha), while the rest was closed to grazing for 3
   years, and then subjected to controlled grazing (stocking rate of
   approx. 0.84 heads/ha during 2 months in the summer of 2007), then
   closed to grazing once again until the spring of 2008. Closing the land
   to grazing for 3 years has a positive impact on production, coverage
   rate, floristic richness and diversity, and provides evidence of the
   resilience of the Saharan ecosystem in these rangelands. Subjecting land
   to controlled grazing and then closing it to grazing does not have a
   negative impact on vegetation, making it an efficient tool for managing
   Saharan rangeland in a sustainable way.}},

Title = {{Predicting invasion in grassland ecosystems: is exotic dominance the

Abstract = {{Invasions have increased the size of regional species pools, but are
   typically assumed to reduce native diversity. However, global-scale
   tests of this assumption have been elusive because of the focus on
   exotic species richness, rather than relative abundance. This is
   problematic because low invader richness can indicate invasion
   resistance by the native community or, alternatively, dominance by a
   single exotic species. Here, we used a globally replicated study to
   quantify relationships between exotic richness and abundance in
   grass-dominated ecosystems in 13 countries on six continents, ranging
   from salt marshes to alpine tundra. We tested effects of human land use,
   native community diversity, herbivore pressure, and nutrient limitation
   on exotic plant dominance. Despite its widespread use, exotic richness
   was a poor proxy for exotic dominance at low exotic richness, because
   sites that contained few exotic species ranged from relatively pristine
   (low exotic richness and cover) to almost completely exotic-dominated
   ones (low exotic richness but high exotic cover). Both exotic cover and
   richness were predicted by native plant diversity (native grass
   richness) and land use (distance to cultivation). Although climate was
   important for predicting both exotic cover and richness, climatic
   factors predicting cover (precipitation variability) differed from those
   predicting richness (maximum temperature and mean temperature in the
   wettest quarter). Herbivory and nutrient limitation did not predict
   exotic richness or cover. Exotic dominance was greatest in areas with
   low native grass richness at the site- or regional-scale. Although this
   could reflect native grass displacement, a lack of biotic resistance is
   a more likely explanation, given that grasses comprise the most
   aggressive invaders. These findings underscore the need to move beyond
   richness as a surrogate for the extent of invasion, because this metric
   confounds monodominance with invasion resistance. Monitoring species'
   relative abundance will more rapidly advance our understanding of

Abstract = {{The grazing of semi-natural grassland (SNG) is encouraged in Europe for
   the conservation of biodiversity, but little is known about the farming
   systems including SNG which farmers develop. The purpose of this study
   was to explore and evaluate at farm level the (1) technical results in
   terms of animal growth, feed use and carcass quality, (2) landscape
   biodiversity value, based on case study of ten Danish suckler beef farms
   with data recording over one year. Herd size varied from 5 to 213
   suckler cows. The main conclusion was that an increasing proportion of
   SNG (up to 45\% of net energy in a year diet at herd level) did not
   obviously imply low technical performances. However, when SNG was used
   as the entire feed to all animals all year long (over 80\% of net energy
   in a year diet at herd level), performances were lower and meat quality
   did not fit the requirements of the meat industry, but were considered
   in alternative market chains. This last type of management (rustic
   breeds kept permanently on SNG) had the highest use of grassland (one
   suckler cow and her offspring for roughly every 3 ha SNG) and thus the
   highest biodiversity conservation potential. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Disproportionate effects of non-colonial small herbivores on structure
   and diversity of grassland dominated by large herbivores}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},

Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The response of semiarid grasslands to small, non-colonial herbivores
   has received little attention, focusing primarily on the effects of
   granivore assemblages on annual plant communities. We studied the
   long-term effects of both small and large herbivores on vegetation
   structure and species diversity of shortgrass steppe, a perennial
   semiarid grassland considered marginal habitat for small mammalian
   herbivores. We hypothesized that 1) large generalist herbivores would
   affect more abundant species and proportions of litter-bare
   ground-vegetation cover through non-selective herbivory, 2) small
   herbivores would affect less common species through selective but
   limited consumption, and 3) herbivore effects on plant richness would
   increase with increasing aboveground net primary production (ANPP).
   Plant community composition was assessed over a 14-year period in
   pastures grazed at moderate intensities by cattle and in exclosures for
   large (cattle) and large-plus-small herbivores (additional exclusion of
   rabbits and rodents). Exclusion of large herbivores affected litter and
   bare ground and basal cover of abundant, common and uncommon species.
   Additional exclusion of small herbivores did not affect uncommon
   components of the plant community, but had indirect effects on abundant
   species, decreased the cover of the dominant grass Bouteloua gracilis
   and total vegetation, and increased litter and species diversity. There
   was no relationship between ANPP and the intensity of effects of either
   herbivore body size on richness. Exclusion of herbivores of both body
   sizes had complementary and additive effects which promoted changes in
   vegetation composition and physiognomy that were linked to increased
   abundance of tall and decreased abundance of short species. Our findings
   show that small mammalian herbivores had disproportionately large
   effects on plant communities relative to their small consumption of
   biomass. Even in small-seeded perennial grasslands with a long history
   of intensive grazing by large herbivores, non-colonial small mammalian
   herbivores should be recognized as an important driver of grassland
   structure and diversity.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents the first description of a tri-trophic interaction
   network with crab spiders as predators. Monthly observations of
   flowering entomophilous plant species were recorded between December
   2009 and March 2010 and their flower visitors and predators (crab
   spiders) were caught, with or without prey. Moreover, flower visitors of
   different orders were caught to evaluate the amount of pollen
   transported. In order to analyze changes in the plant species and crab
   spiders, we evaluated the interaction networks in which we had removed
   different orders of prey (Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera) from the
   original network. Our results indicate that crab spiders select their
   preys within the community. Furthermore, the Hymenoptera carried higher
   pollen loads and were the less frequent prey. When the Diptera preys
   were removed from the initial interaction network, network changes
   mainly affected the species richness of crab spiders. Decrease in
   density of Diptera could increase plant resources useful for flower
   visitors carrying great pollen loads and could promote pollination. Crab
   spider prey might be restricted to only the more vulnerable flower
   visitors (e.g. smaller dimensions, without sting or with delicate
   cuticula) which consume resources and are inefficient as pollen
   carriers. The selected predation could not negatively affect the fitness
   of plants.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive conversion of natural areas for agricultural production has
   had many consequences, including reduced habitat for nesting birds.
   Increasing focus on habitat re-establishment has led to the
   establishment of patches of perennial herbaceous vegetation in these
   agricultural landscapes, although these often consist of monotypic grass
   fields with little vegetation diversity. In 2001 and 2002, we assessed
   songbird responses to mowing followed by a soil disturbance (disking)
   meant to increase vegetation diversity and abundance of arthropod food
   resources in conservation easements in East-central Iowa, USA. We
   randomly assigned fields to disking and control treatments and collected
   data on breeding bird density and species richness in these habitats
   before and after treatments were applied. Disking increased density of
   all species combined, several individual species including dickcissel
   (Spiza americana; a declining species of concern), and overall
   conservation value of bird communities in treated fields. Total bird
   density increased with disking when the size of disked area was
   relatively small, and dickcissels and American goldfinches (Spinus
   tristis) responded positively and negatively to block-shaped treatments,
   respectively. Most species either showed no response or increased in
   density with disking. Changes associated with disking treatments were
   likely related to changes in both vegetation structure and increased
   abundance and biomass of arthropod food resources. Disking appears to be
   an effective management practice for maintaining herbaceous habitats,
   increasing vegetation diversity and food availability for insectivorous
   birds, and increasing habitat quality for priority bird species. Given
   the increasing availability of monotypic grasslands in agricultural
   landscapes, this practice may provide a relatively inexpensive way to
   improve re-established habitats. (C) 2013 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Research on moose-mediated seed dispersal is limited. However, its
   potential role in transferring seeds in patchy landscapes may be of
   great importance. In this work we examined how seasons and vegetation
   diversity influence the species richness and abundance of seeds
   dispersed endozoochorically by moose. Samples of moose faeces were
   collected year-round, fortnightly, from contrasting vegetation types,
   dominated by diverse, species-rich wetland or poor, dry pine forest. The
   viable seed content of dung was studied by the seedling emergence
   method. The mean number of emerged seedlings per 0.8 L sample and the
   mean number of plant species per 0.8 L sample were several times higher
   in the diverse wetland vegetation than in the poor pine forest
   vegetation. Maximum species richness and seed abundance was observed
   during the fructification period, and the minimum during spring. The
   species richness of samples did not differ between winter and the
   growing season, although the composition of plant species was different.
   The results of this study suggest that moose are efficient seed vectors,
   especially of grasses typical for grasslands and wetlands. The species
   richness and abundance of dispersed seeds coincides with the diversity
   of the vegetation of the animal's habitat.}},

Title = {{Dairy farm impacts of fencing riparian land: Pasture production and farm
   productivity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{130}},
Pages = {{255-266}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Dairy farmers are encouraged to restrict stock access by fencing
   riparian zones to reduce stream pollution and improve biodiversity. Many
   farmers are reluctant to create fenced riparian zones because of the
   perceived loss of productive pasture. Anecdotal reports indicate that
   pasture production in fenced areas is especially valued during summer
   months when water stress is likely to limit pasture growth in other
   areas of the farm. We measured pasture production, botanical
   composition, soil moisture, and fertility in Riparian (within 20 m of
   the riverbank), Flat (greater than 20 but less than 50 m from the
   riverbank), and Hill (elevated) areas on three commercial dairy farms
   from October 2006 to November 2007 in south eastern Australia.
   Riparian and Flat areas produced significantly more pasture, with on
   average approximately 25\% more dry matter per ha grown in these areas
   compared with Hill paddocks. Percentage ryegrass was 14\% lower on Hill
   slopes compared with Riparian and Flat areas and was compensated for by
   only a 5\% increase in other grass species. Significant seasonal effects
   were observed with the difference in pasture production between Hill,
   and Riparian and Flat areas most pronounced in summer, due to soil
   moisture limitations on Hill paddocks.
   To examine potential productivity impacts of this lost pasture, we used
   a questionnaire-based survey to interview the farmers regarding their
   farm and riparian management activities. The additional pasture that
   would have been available if the riverbanks were not fenced to their
   current widths ranged from 6.2 to 27.2 t DM for the 2006/2007 year and
   would have been grown on 0.4-3.4\% of their milking area. If this
   pasture was harvested instead of grazed, the farmers could have saved
   between \$2000 and \$8000 of their purchased fodder costs in that year.
   By fencing their riparian areas to 20 m for biodiversity benefits,
   between 2.2\% and 9.8\% of their milking area would be out of production
   amounting to about \$16,000 in additional purchased fodder costs. We
   discuss the additional fencing, production, and on-going management
   costs associated with fencing riparian areas, the costs to the
   environment and the enterprise of stock freely accessing waterways, as
   well as the policy implications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{What is the future for livestock agriculture in the world? Consumers
   have concerns about sustainability but many widely used livestock
   production methods do not satisfy consumers' requirements for a
   sustainable system. However, production can be sustainable, occurring in
   environments that: supply the needs of the animals resulting in good
   welfare, allow coexistence with a wide diversity of organisms native to
   the area, minimize carbon footprint and provide a fair lifestyle for the
   people working there. Conservation need not just involve tiny islands of
   natural vegetation in a barren world of agriculture, as there can be
   great increases in biodiversity in farmed areas. Herbivores, especially
   ruminants that consume materials inedible by humans, are important for
   human food in the future. However, their diet should not be just
   ground-level plants. Silvopastoral systems, pastures with shrubs and
   trees as well as herbage, are described which are normally more
   productive than pasture alone. When compared with widely used livestock
   production systems, silvopastoral systems can provide efficient feed
   conversion, higher biodiversity, enhanced connectivity between habitat
   patches and better animal welfare, so they can replace existing systems
   in many parts of the world and should be further developed.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 20}},
Abstract = {{Livestock exerts direct and indirect effects on plant communities,
   changing colonization and extinction rates of species and the
   surrounding environmental conditions. There is scarce knowledge on how
   and to what extent these effects control the floristic and functional
   composition of plant communities in grasslands. We performed an
   experiment that included several treatments simulating trampling,
   defoliation, faeces addition and their combinations in a Mediterranean
   scrub community grazing-abandoned for at least 50 years. We monitored
   the plots for four years, and collected data on species composition,
   photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and red: far-red ratio (R:FR),
   soil moisture and compaction. We estimated community weighted means
   (CWM) for height, habit, life cycle, seed mass and SLA. Neither
   compaction nor soil moisture were modified by the treatments, while PAR
   and R: FR increased in all treatments in comparison to the Control and
   Faeces treatments. The floristic composition of all treatments, except
   for Faeces, converged over time, but deviated from that of the Control.
   The functional traits displayed the trends expected in the presence of
   grazing: loss of erect species and increased cover of short species with
   light seeds, with rosettes and prostrate habit. However, contrary to the
   results in literature, SLA was lower in all the treatments than Control
   plots. Like the results for floristic composition, all treatments except
   for Faeces converged towards a similar functional composition at the end
   of the four year period. The results of this study show the initial
   evolution of a Mediterranean plant community in the presence of grazing,
   driven primarily by the destructive action of livestock. These actions
   seem to directly affect the rates of extinction/colonization, and
   indirectly affect the light environment but not the soil conditions.
   However, their effects on floristic and trait composition do not seem to
   differ, at least at the small spatio-temporal scale.}},

Title = {{Seasonal Dynamics of the Plant Community and Soil Seed Bank along a
   Successional Gradient in a Subalpine Meadow on the Tibetan Plateau}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Knowledge about how change the importance of soil seed bank
   and relationship between seed mass and abundance during vegetation
   succession is crucial for understanding vegetation dynamics. Many
   studies have been conducted, but their ecological mechanisms of
   community assembly are not fully understood.
   Methodology: We examined the seasonal dynamics of the vegetation and
   soil seed bank as well as seed size distribution along a successional
   gradient. We also explored the potential role of the soil seed bank in
   plant community regeneration, the relationship between seed mass and
   species abundance, and the relative importance of deterministic and
   stochastic processes along a successional gradient.
   Principal Findings: Species richness of seed bank increased (shallow
   layer and the total) and seed density decreased (each layer and the
   total) significantly with succession. Species richness and seed density
   differed significantly between different seasons and among soil depths.
   Seed mass showed a significant negative relationship with relative
   abundance in the earliest successional stage, but the relationships were
   not significant in later stages. Seed mass showed no relationship with
   relative abundance in the whole successional series in seed bank.
   Results were similar for both July 2005 and April 2006.
   Conclusions: The seed mass and abundance relationship was determined by
   a complex interaction between small and larger seeded species and
   environmental factors. Both stochastic processes and deterministic
   processes were important determinants of the structure of the earliest
   stage. The importance of seed bank decreased with succession. The
   restoration of abandoned farmed and grazed meadows to the species-rich
   subalpine meadow in Tibetan Plateau can be successfully achieved from
   the soil seed bank. However, at least 20 years are required to fully
   restore an abandoned agricultural meadow to a natural mature subalpine
   meadow.}},

Abstract = {{Extensive land clearing in many parts of the global tropics is a major
   threat to biodiversity, and strategies are urgently needed to reinstate
   forest. Tree planting is a commonly used strategy to rapidly restore
   forest to degraded landscapes. However, tree planting is expensive, and
   in most cases financial constraints prevent its use at a scale needed to
   address the ongoing legacy of land clearing. Here, we conduct a
   quantitative review of literature from the global tropics and evaluate
   outcomes of less intensive interventions (i.e. non-planting) aimed at
   stimulating natural regeneration of forest. We focus specifically on
   overcoming barriers to native plant regeneration that predominate in the
   earliest stages of succession. Common interventions include varied
   strategies to suppress herbaceous vegetation (e.g. cutting or herbicide
   treatment), and measures to bolster propagule supply (e.g. direct
   seeding and artificial bird perches). There was an apparent trend among
   pair-wise comparisons of effect sizes to suggest that combined
   interventions to simultaneously suppress herbaceous vegetation and
   increase propagule supply resulted in the most consistent outcomes in
   terms of promoting progress toward restoring forest structure. Despite
   an obvious demand for lower cost interventions, a paucity of information
   means that it is still premature to generalize outcomes of specific
   interventions and their overall cost relative to active tree planting.
   Nevertheless, we report an increase in research effort in this area, and
   suggest promising directions to accelerate progress that will improve
   capacity to select optimal, cost effective strategies that achieve
   long-term restoration objectives with a particular level of certainty.}},

Abstract = {{The study was conducted to assess the status and trends of soil erosion
   and relate the perceptions of farmers on cattle productivity and
   botanical indicators to measured ecological conditions of rangelands in
   three altitude regions of southwest Ethiopia. A total of 342 farmers
   were interviewed. In addition, the ecological condition of rangelands
   was assessed. Severe soil erosion, ranked as the primary restriction to
   free-ranging livestock, occurred predominantly in the lower altitude
   region (LAR) (P < 0.05). More farmers in LAR witnessed an inadequacy of
   palatable plant biomass, grazable pasture as well as increased gully
   formation and expansion, which are strong indicators of soil erosion (P
   < 0.001). In addition to a decrease in grass cover and productivity of
   cattle, botanical composition, species richness and grazing capacity of
   herbaceous plants, less fodder trees and shrubs were observed (P <
   0.05). There was a corresponding increase in the percentage of bare
   ground and soil erosion status along the degradation gradients (P <
   0.05). The reported shift in botanical composition, and especially
   encroachment of invading plant species, can be attributed to soil
   erosion (P < 0.001). The results suggest that erosion is associated with
   reduced availability of feed resources and is related to altitude
   variation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Assessment of fine-scale plant species beta diversity using WorldView-2
   satellite spectral dissimilarity}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{18}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Plant species beta diversity is influenced by spatial heterogeneity in
   the environment. This heterogeneity can potentially be characterised
   with the help of remote sensing. We used WorldView-2 satellite data
   acquired over semi-natural grasslands on The Baltic island of Oland
   (Sweden) to examine whether dissimilarities in remote sensing response
   were related to fine-scale, between-plot dissimilarity (beta diversity)
   in non-woody vascular plant species composition within the grasslands.
   Fieldwork, including the on-site description of a set of 30 2 m x 2 m
   plots and a set of 30 4 m x 4 m plots, was performed to record the
   species dissimilarity between pairs of same-sized plots. Spectral data
   were extracted by associating each plot with a suite of differently
   sized pixel windows, and spectral dissimilarity was calculated between
   pairs of same-sized pixel windows. Relationships between spectral
   dissimilarity and beta diversity were analysed using univariate
   regression and partial least squares regression. The study revealed
   significant positive relationships between spectral dissimilarity and
   fine-scale (2 m x 2 m and 4 m x 4 m) between-plot species dissimilarity.
   The correlation between the predicted and the observed species
   dissimilarity was stronger for the set of large plots (4 m x 4 m) than
   for the set of small plots (2 m x 2 m), and the association between
   spectral and species data at both plot scales decreased when pixel
   windows larger than 3 x 3 pixels were used. We suggest that the
   significant relationship between spectral dissimilarity and species
   dissimilarity is a reflection of between-plot environmental
   heterogeneity caused by differences in grazing intensity (which result
   in between-plot differences in field-layer height, and amounts of
   biomass and litter). This heterogeneity is reflected in dissimilarities
   in both the species composition and the spectral response of the
   grassland plots. Between-plot dissimilarities in both spectral response
   and species composition may also be caused by between-plot variations in
   edaphic conditions. Our results indicate that high spatial resolution
   satellite data may potentially be able to complement field-based
   recording in surveys of fine-scale species diversity in semi-natural
   grasslands. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{33}},

Abstract = {{Unique plateau wetlands in China provide essential ecosystem functions
   and services and influence the health, environment and security of the
   downstream regions. In recent years, these plateau wetlands have
   experienced significant anthropogenic disturbance, but studies that
   evaluate the effects of such disturbance on ecological stability are
   rare. Our study tested how three typical types of human-related
   activities affect plant richness and ecological stability in Napahai
   plateau wetland, Shangri-La, China. The results showed that the
   anthropogenic disturbance had a direct effect on richness, and an
   indirect effect on stability mediated by richness. Anthropogenic
   disturbance did not alter the positive relationship between plant
   richness and community stability, and the stabilizing effect of richness
   could be explained by statistical averaging, overyielding effect, and
   component population stability. Our study complements previous studies
   that tested the richness-stability relationships in synthesized
   assemblages with richness specifically manipulated and studies that
   introduced mowing treatment to mimic real anthropogenic disturbance. The
   results further suggest that necessary steps, such as anthropogenic
   disturbance mitigation and plant richness conservation, are urgently
   required for maintaining healthy plateau wetlands and for sustaining
   their ecosystem functions and services.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to compare the butterfly assemblages in
   semi-natural pastures and power-line corridors and to analyse the
   effects of vegetation height, occurrence of trees and shrubs and
   different flowering vascular plant groups on butterfly diversity and
   abundance. Twelve of 26 analysed butterfly species were more abundant in
   power-line corridors than in semi-natural pastures. Only one species
   preferred semi-natural pastures. In semi-natural pastures butterflies
   were most common in segments with tall vegetation, whereas butterflies
   in power-line corridors were most common in segments with vegetation of
   short or intermediate height. Short vegetation was sparser in power-line
   corridors (mean cover 4\%) than in semi-natural pastures (33\%), whereas
   tall vegetation was more common in power-line corridors (59\%) than in
   semi-natural pastures (35\%). The amount of flowers was the factor that
   affected the abundance of most species. Twenty-one of the 26 species
   showed positive associations with numbers of flowers of different
   families. Flowers of the plant families Apiaceae, Caryophyllaceae,
   Primulaceae, Rubiaceae, Scrophulariaceae, and Violaceae showed positive
   associations with the abundance of several butterfly species. Vegetation
   height seems to be a limiting factor in semi-natural pastures, and less
   intensive management (division of pastures into grazing pens, late
   season grazing, grazing every second year, or reduced grazing pressure)
   would benefit butterflies. In power-line corridors (dominated by tall
   vegetation) the opposite would be beneficial for butterflies, for
   example more frequent clearing of vegetation along the power-line trails
   combined with mowing of selected areas.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1829-1840}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Woody encroachment in grasslands is a global phenomenon driven by
   complex interactions between climate, grazing and fire management.
   Alpine shrub encroachment is of particular concern for biological
   conservation because high-elevation grasslands harbor high levels of
   biodiversity and species endemism. Paramo grasslands of the high Andes
   are exceptionally high in floral diversity, but traditional agricultural
   practices have resulted in widespread livestock grazing and
   anthropogenic burning. Fire suppression has frequently been identified a
   driver of woody expansion in other grasslands, and conservation
   initiatives that aim to decrease burning and grazing in paramos may
   inadvertently lead to shrub encroachment. We tested whether interactions
   among fire and grazing legacies, topography and edaphic conditions
   predicted the patchy distribution of encroaching shrubs in an Ecuadorian
   paramo 10 years after release from burning and grazing. Interviews with
   land-users identified proximity to roads, footpaths and riparian areas
   as proxies for fire frequency and grazing pressure. A recursive
   partitioning model of shrub cover revealed that woody abundance was
   generally lower at lower elevations, especially near the access road
   (where fire frequency and grazing pressure were high). Within the
   low-elevation areas, shrub cover was highest near streams (where grazing
   pressure was high). These results suggest that (1) the effects of fire
   and grazing legacies depend on the spatial patterns of grazing, and (2)
   legacy effects interact with topography to help explain patchy shrub
   encroachment.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how habitat selection changes with population density is a
   key concept in population regulation, community composition and managing
   impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services. At low density, it is
   expected that individuals select habitats in terms of their preference,
   but as population density increases, the availability of resources per
   individual declines on preferred habitats, leading to competition which
   forces some individuals to exploit less preferred habitats. Using
   spatial information of Scottish red deer (Cervus elaphus) winter counts,
   carried out in 110 areas across Scotland between 1961 and 2004 (a total
   of 1,206,495 deer observations), we showed how winter habitat niche
   breadth in red deer has widened with increasing population density.
   Heather moorland and montane habitats were most and least preferred for
   deer, respectively. Increasing density favoured the selection of
   grassland, to the detriment of the selection of heather moorland. The
   selection of heather and grassland decreased when temperature increased,
   while the selection of montane and peatland habitats increased. These
   findings are important for understanding how habitat use, density and
   population are likely to be affected by weather, and allow us to predict
   habitat impacts by large mammal herbivory and climate.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use intensification leads to species loss and shifts in community
   composition, but only few studies examine how these dynamics affect
   ecological and life-history traits. We thus investigated whether
   ecological and life-history traits differ between butterfly communities
   of grasslands with different land-use intensity. We conducted butterfly
   transect surveys in 137 grassland sites in three regions of Germany and
   compiled 10 species-specific ecological and life-history traits from the
   literature. These traits are associated with food plant specialisation,
   dispersal, distribution, reproduction and development. We calculated a
   land-use intensity gradient based on the amount of fertilise mowing
   frequency and grazing intensity. We analysed differences of traits
   characteristics between butterfly communities along the land-use
   intensity gradient in a fourth-corner analysis, thus considering
   correlations between traits. Six ecological and life-history traits
   changed from characteristics associated with specialists to such
   associated with generalists with increasing land-use intensity. These
   traits characteristics in intensified grasslands were: high dispersal
   propensity, large distribution range, low population density, more than
   one generation per year, hibernation in a more advanced developmental
   stage and a long flight period. The functional homogenisation of the
   butterfly communities with changes from specialist to generalist trait
   characteristics with increasing land-use intensity may have severe
   consequences for ecosystem functioning and services.}},

Title = {{Changes in hedgerow floral diversity over 70 years in an English rural
   landscape, and the impacts of management}},

Abstract = {{Hedgerows provide key habitat and refuges for wildlife in otherwise
   intensively-managed landscapes, and may play a role in connecting
   increasingly fragmented habitats. However, the processes governing
   changes to the floral biodiversity of hedges are poorly understood. We
   analysed a unique, long-term data set of plant species richness over a
   70 year period at 357 hedgerow sites in southern England to quantify
   changes in alpha, beta and gamma diversity, and identify the role of
   hedge management and other possible drivers of change. Alpha diversity
   increased in hedgerows, while a reduction in beta diversity was
   indicated by taxonomic homogenisation, whereby previously distinct
   communities of species become more similar to one another over time.
   Changes in the regional species pool (gamma diversity) differed with
   plant life-history; it increased for woody species but decreased among
   herbaceous hedge species. Hedgerow communities shifted towards species
   associated with higher soil fertility, a more competitive ecological
   strategy and, in unmanaged hedgerows, greater shade tolerance. Probable
   drivers for these changes include the move from traditional forms of
   management such as coppicing and hedge-laying towards either no
   management or frequent cutting with a mechanical flail, and
   eutrophication. The extent of changes in plant diversity over time was
   determined by both historical and recent hedgerow management, but these
   management effects varied with plant life-history attributes. However,
   changes in hedge quality and floral diversity were not linked directly
   to a 60\% increase in the proportion of land use categories classified
   as `intensive' adjacent to the sites over the 70 years. Recommendations
   are made for future hedgerow management based on conservation objectives
   for specific groups of hedge plant species. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The decomposition of dung constitutes an ecosystem service of massive
   proportions. Previous studies addressing how it depends on individual
   invertebrate taxa have been focused on small spatial scales, neglecting
   the impact of large-scale factors like climate. Here, we use the concept
   of citizen science to quantify taxon-specific contributions to dung
   decomposition at the level of a nation. Young people across Finland
   manipulated the decomposer communities of cow pats, then measured
   changes in pat mass over the grazing season. In southern Finland most
   (90\%) of the cattle dung hitting pastures decomposed in just two
   months, whereas 1100 km to the north the corresponding fraction was
   smaller (74\%). Of the total invertebrate-caused decomposition (13\% of
   dung pat mass, independent of latitude), large tunneling dor beetles in
   the genus Geotrupes account for 61\%, hence removing dung twice as fast
   as do smaller dung-dwelling beetles and earthworms. Overall, this paper
   illustrates how ecologists may direct citizen scientists to implement
   massive ecological experiments. Compared to an approach based purely on
   professional scientists, we saved three-quarters of the costs.
   Ultimately, citizen science may offer a key tool for testing current
   ecological theories at relevant spatial scalesand for disseminating
   these theories in the process.}},

Abstract = {{Questions(1) Does climate amelioration in semi-arid ecosystems increase
   seed bank richness and seed density in both total and persistent seed
   banks? (2) Does herbivory modulate climate effects on soil seed banks?
   (3) Is this effect mediated by changes in the above-ground vegetation?
   (4) To what extent do environmental conditions affect similarity between
   the total and persistent seed banks, and between above-ground
   (vegetation) vs below-ground (seed bank) community compartments?
   LocationEcuadorian Dry Mountain Scrub Ecosystem.
   MethodsOur study was conducted along a climatic gradient (altitude)
   under two different management conditions: undisturbed and grazed. The
   effect of grazing, altitude and their interaction on seed abundance and
   richness of the total and persistent soil seed banks were evaluated with
   non-linear mixed models.
   ResultsAltitude, grazing and their interaction exerted a significant
   effect on richness and abundance of the total seed bank, but not on the
   persistent seed bank. At highly stressful climate conditions,
   differences in species richness between the total and persistent seed
   banks were small or absent, while at milder environmental conditions the
   total seed bank showed greater seed species richness and abundance than
   the persistent one. However, under grazing conditions, species richness
   in both seed banks was rather similar along the climatic gradient.
   Relationships in terms of species richness between above-ground vs
   below-ground compartments, shifted from being dominated by the
   above-ground component at low altitudes (more stress) to being dominated
   by the seed bank component at higher elevations (milder conditions). In
   grazed locations, vegetation and seed bank showed similar species
   richness throughout the altitudinal gradient.
   ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that not only climate acted as a key
   environmental filter on soil seed bank properties, but also that grazing
   greatly modulated the primary effect of climate. Nevertheless, the
   effect of climate and grazing was restricted to the total seed bank (the
   fertility compartment) and no effect was observed in the persistent seed
   bank (longevity compartment). In this tropical dry scrub, richness and
   abundance of seeds increased upwards along the altitudinal gradient,
   most likely because at higher altitudes environmental conditions improve
   and become more benign for plant development.}},

Title = {{Plant Functional Diversity and Species Diversity in the Mongolian Steppe}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Mongolian steppe is one of the most important grasslands
   in the world but suffers from aridization and damage from anthropogenic
   activities. Understanding structure and function of this community is
   important for the ecological conservation, but has seldom been
   investigated.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, a total of 324 quadrats
   located on the three main types of Mongolian steppes were surveyed.
   Early-season perennial forbs (37\% of total importance value),
   late-season annual forbs (33\%) and late-season perennial forbs (44\%)
   were dominant in meadow, typical and desert steppes, respectively.
   Species richness, diversity and plant functional type (PFT) richness
   decreased from the meadow, via typical to desert steppes, but evenness
   increased; PFT diversity in the desert and meadow steppes was higher
   than that in typical steppe. However, above-ground net primary
   productivity (ANPP) was far lower in desert steppe than in the other two
   steppes. In addition, the slope of the relationship between species
   richness and PFT richness increased from the meadow, via typical to
   desert steppes. Similarly, with an increase in species diversity, PFT
   diversity increased more quickly in both the desert and typical steppes
   than that in meadow steppe. Random resampling suggested that this
   coordination was partly due to a sampling effect of diversity.
   Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that desert steppe
   should be strictly protected because of its limited functional
   redundancy, which its ecological functioning is sensitive to species
   loss. In contrast, despite high potential forage production shared by
   the meadow and typical steppes, management of these two types of steppes
   should be different: meadow steppe should be preserved due to its higher
   conservation value characterized by more species redundancy and higher
   spatial heterogeneity, while typical steppe could be utilized moderately
   because its dominant grass genus Stipa is resistant to herbivory and
   drought.}},

Title = {{Response of the Abundance of Key Soil Microbial Nitrogen-Cycling Genes
   to Multi-Factorial Global Changes}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Multiple co-occurring environmental changes are affecting soil nitrogen
   cycling processes, which are mainly mediated by microbes. While it is
   likely that various nitrogen-cycling functional groups will respond
   differently to such environmental changes, very little is known about
   their relative responsiveness. Here we conducted four long-term
   experiments in a steppe ecosystem by removing plant functional groups,
   mowing, adding nitrogen, adding phosphorus, watering, warming, and
   manipulating some of their combinations. We quantified the abundance of
   seven nitrogen-cycling genes, including those for fixation (nifH),
   mineralization (chiA), nitrification (amoA of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria
   (AOB) or archaea (AOA)), and denitrification (nirS, nirK and nosZ).
   First, for each gene, we compared its sensitivities to different
   environmental changes and found that the abundances of various genes
   were sensitive to distinct and different factors. Overall, the
   abundances of nearly all genes were sensitive to nitrogen enrichment. In
   addition, the abundances of the chiA and nosZ genes were sensitive to
   plant functional group removal, the AOB-amoA gene abundance to
   phosphorus enrichment when nitrogen was added simultaneously, and the
   nirS and nirK gene abundances responded to watering. Second, for each
   single-or multifactorial environmental change, we compared the
   sensitivities of the abundances of different genes and found that
   different environmental changes primarily affected different gene
   abundances. Overall, AOB-amoA gene abundance was most responsive,
   followed by the two denitrifying genes nosZ and nirS, while the other
   genes were less sensitive. These results provide, for the first time,
   systematic insights into how the abundance of each type of
   nitrogen-cycling gene and the equilibrium state of all these
   nitrogen-cycling gene abundances would shift under each single-or
   multi-factorial global change.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The seasonal dynamics of molluscan assemblages inhabiting the algal
   fronds and the underlying sediment of photophilous algae were analyzed
   in NW Alboran Sea between July 2007 and April 2008. Molluscs were
   sampled using SCUBA in two different algal stands (7 km apart) dominated
   by the brown algae Stypocaulon scoparium, and following an inter-strata
   sampling protocol consisting in first sampling the algal fronds and then
   the underlying substratum. The studied algal stands harbored a highly
   biodiverse malacofauna, with 193 species identified. Assemblages on
   algal fronds and sediment displayed significant seasonal variations,
   being more apparent on the fronds, with maximum species richness,
   abundance and Shannon-Wiener diversity values in summer in both strata.
   The between-strata differences were also observed in the trophic
   structure of the assemblages: algal fronds were quantitatively dominated
   by microalgae or periphyton grazers and the sediment by detritivores and
   plankton and seston feeders. The high dominance of some species resulted
   in lower values of diversity and evenness in autumn in the sediment
   (e.g. Nodulus contortus and Bittium reticulatum) and in spring on the
   fronds (e.g. Rissoa guerinii and Musculus costulatus). The seasonal
   variability of the assemblages was mainly related to the population
   dynamics of dominant species (22 spp. displaying dominance values > 1\%)
   (i.e. recruitment events, high mortality rates of juveniles and/or
   migrations among habitats). Other factors analyzed were (1) the
   vegetative cycle of algae, which played an important role in the
   abundance of some dominant epifaunal grazers, with high abundance and
   species richness values coinciding with high biomass of algae; and (2)
   the percentage of organic matter in the sediment, which was related to
   the abundance changes of some depositivores species. Further
   conservation strategies for macroalgal stands should be taken into
   consideration, as this type of photophilous habitat harbors rich
   associated faunistic communities and it is not generally considered in
   conservation lists of habitats to be protected. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Assessing spatiotemporal changes in tiger habitat across different land
   management regimes}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Human-induced habitat loss and degradation are increasing the extinction
   probability of many wildlife species worldwide, thus protecting habitat
   is crucial. The habitat of thousands of imperiled wildlife species
   occurs in a variety of land management regimes (e.g., protected areas,
   multiple-use areas), each exerting differing effects. We used the
   globally endangered tiger (Panthera tigris) to examine the relationships
   between habitat change and land management in Nepal's Chitwan district,
   a global biodiversity hotspot. We evaluated the effects of environmental
   and human factors on tiger habitat based on data acquired by
   motion-detecting cameras and space-borne imaging sensors. Spatiotemporal
   habitat dynamics in Chitwan National Park and a multiple-use area
   outside the park were then evaluated in three time periods (1989, 1999,
   and 2009). Our results indicate that tigers preferred areas with more
   grasslands and higher landscape connectivity. The area of highly
   suitable habitat decreased inside the park over the entire 20 year
   interval, while outside the park habitat suitability increased,
   especially from 1999 to 2009. The loss of highly suitable habitat inside
   the park may be associated with an increasing trend of unauthorized
   resource extraction by a rapidly growing human population, coupled with
   natural processes such as flooding and forest succession. In contrast,
   community-based management of natural resources and the prohibition of
   livestock grazing since the late 1990s likely improved tiger habitat
   suitability outside the park. Results of this study are useful for
   evaluating habitat change and guiding conservation actions across the
   tiger range, which spans 13 countries. Moreover, quantitatively
   assessing habitat change across different land management regimes in
   human-dominated areas provides insights for conserving habitat of other
   imperiled wildlife species around the world.}},

Abstract = {{Macromoth diversity, abundance, and community structure in the
   topographically complex HJ Andrews Experimental Forest and LTER site was
   studied on the west slope of the Cascade Range, Oregon. Data on 493
   macromoth species (62,221 individuals) was sampled eight times/year at
   20 locations from 2004 to 2008 and examined using multivariate
   statistics and generalized additive models to determine the importance
   of topography and vegetation on moth community assembly and diversity.
   Significant differences exist between moth communities at lower and
   higher elevations. High-elevation moth communities are far more variable
   inter-annually, whether associated with high-elevation forests, meadows,
   or clearcuts. Low-elevation young and old gymnosperm forests and
   riparian forests are more stable and predictable communities having less
   inter-annual variability. High-elevation communities show more
   intra-annual variability than low-elevation communities. Low-elevation
   moth communities are more abundant than high-elevation communities and
   typically associated with the most common, abundant species of
   macromoths in the study. High-elevation communities, by contrast, are
   associated with less abundant, more evenly distributed species, as well
   as with rare moth species. Macromoth community structure and diversity
   were related to year or sample period and structural descriptions of
   vegetation communities, but not related to known host-plant diversity.
   High-elevation communities are threatened by contraction of montane
   meadows and climate change which, given the variability in
   high-elevation communities, could severely impact the biological
   diversity of the western Cascades landscape. Nocturnal macromoths
   represent an important potential indicator of ecosystem health and
   change.}},

Abstract = {{Collective action, on communal grazing land, has evolved in the
   highlands of north-western Ethiopia to mitigate the problems of feed
   shortage and land degradation due to overgrazing. The exercise is liked
   by farmers for improving the availability of natural pasture during the
   long dry season when other feed sources get depleted. However, large
   portions of the communal grazing lands are still managed under free
   grazing throughout the year. This study was undertaken in Maynet village
   in the upper Blue Nile basin, northwestern Ethiopia, to assess the
   impacts of three different types of grazing land management (GLM) and
   two slope gradients ( < 10\%; 15-25\%) on aboveground herbaceous biomass
   yield, ground cover, species richness, runoff, soil loss and soil bulk
   density of grazing lands. The GLMs include (a) freely open communal GLM,
   (b) restricted communal GLM - collective management of communal grazing
   land locally named as `yebere sar' and (c) private holding GLM. Stocking
   density was more than carrying capacity of grazing lands across all
   GLMs. However, the extent of overstocking problem was exceptionally
   severe in freely open communal GLM. The interaction between GLM and
   slope was significant (P<0.05) for runoff, soil loss and runoff
   coefficient. The average runoff coefficient was close to 50\% in freely
   open communal GLM on steeper slopes (15-25\%). Freely open communal GLM
   on steeper slopes resulted in consistently highest cumulative runoff and
   soil loss amounting to 491 mm and 32 t/ha per year, respectively.
   Polynomial regression analysis showed that quadratic relationship
   (r(2)=0.87) existed between soil loss and runoff. But, soil loss was
   close to nil when runoff did not exceed 2 mm per rainfall event. As
   expected, restricted communal GLM appeared to reduce surface runoff by
   more than 40\% and curb the rate of soil erosion by more than 50\%
   compared to freely open communal GLM. Its vegetation cover persisted
   above 70\% throughout the year, meeting the threshold level recommended
   to keep surface runoff and soil loss to minimum. Reducing the problem of
   overstocking and pasture resting in August November are important
   components to improve ground cover and aboveground herbaceous biomass
   yield, which in turn reduce land degradation on grazing lands. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Many paddy fields in the mountainous rural areas of Japan have been
   abandoned since the 1960s, and forests have regenerated on these sites.
   In a mountainous area on Sado Island, a large number of abandoned
   paddies were converted into wetlands and open terrestrial vegetation. In
   this study, we used pitfall traps to examine the effects of the creation
   of open vegetation on carabid beetle assemblages by investigating 14
   sites spanning five vegetation types: six sites in secondary forests
   (three coppice forests and three 40-year-old regenerating forests on
   abandoned paddies), three each in clear-cuts and paddy levees, and two
   in grasslands. The 14 study sites were clearly separated into two groups
   different in the species composition of carabid beetles: secondary
   forest and grassland-levee groups. The species composition of two
   clear-cut sites was similar to that of secondary forests, whereas that
   of the remaining one clear-cut site was similar to that of grasslands.
   Analyses of species responses showed various habitat preferences, e.g.,
   for only coppice forests, for two types of secondary forests, for
   secondary forests and clear-cuts, for clear-cuts and grasslands, and for
   grasslands or levees, or no clear preference. There were no
   characteristic species in the regenerating forests. These results
   suggest that the 40-year-old regenerating forests may sustain only a
   limited subset of the carabid fauna found in coppice forests and that
   the creation of open vegetation in the abandoned paddies enhances
   carabid diversity at the landscape level by raising diversity among the
   different vegetation types.}},

Abstract = {{Biotic invasions and habitat modification are two drivers of global
   change predicted to have detrimental impacts on the persistence of
   indigenous biota worldwide. Few studies have investigated how they
   operate synergistically to alter trophic interactions among indigenous
   and nonindigenous species in invaded ecosystems. We experimentally
   manipulated a suite of interacting invasive mammals, including top
   predators (cat Felis catus, ferret Mustela furo, stoat M. erminea),
   herbivores (rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus, hare Lepus europaeus), and an
   insectivore (hedgehog Erinaceus europaeus occidentalis), and measured
   their effects on indigenous lizards and invertebrates and on an invasive
   mesopredator (house mouse Mus musculus). The work was carried out in a
   grassland/shrubland ecosystem that had been subjected to two types of
   habitat modification (widespread introduction of high-seed-producing
   pasture species, and areas of land use intensification by fertilization
   and livestock grazing). We also quantified food productivity for
   indigenous and invasive fauna by measuring pasture biomass, as well as
   seed and fruit production by grasses and shrubs. Indigenous fauna did
   not always increase following top-predator suppression: lizards
   increased on one of two sites; invertebrates did not increase on either
   site. Mesopredator release of mice was evident at the site where lizards
   did not increase, suggesting negative effects of mice on lizard
   populations. High mouse abundance occurred only on the
   predator-suppression site with regular production of pasture seed,
   indicating that this food resource was the main driver of mouse
   populations. Removal of herbivores increased pasture and seed
   production, which further enhanced ecological release of mice,
   particularly where pasture swards were overtopped by shrubs. An effect
   of landscape supplementation was also evident where nearby fertilized
   pastures boosted rabbit numbers and the associated top predators. Other
   studies have shown that both suppression of invasive predators and
   retiring land from grazing can benefit indigenous species, but our
   results suggest that the ensuing vegetation changes and complex
   interactions among invasive species can block recovery of indigenous
   fauna vulnerable to mesopredators. Top-down and bottom-up ecological
   release of mesopredators and landscape supplementation of top predators
   are key processes to consider when managing invaded communities in
   complex landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing habitat heterogeneity is widely considered to improve
   conditions for biodiversity. Yet benefits for native species depend on
   scale and the effect of heterogeneity on key processes influencing
   survival and reproduction. We examined the relationship between habitat
   heterogeneity and brood parasitism at multiple scales in a region
   characterized by (1) relatively high cowbird abundance, (2) high
   abundance of our focal species, the grassland obligate Grasshopper
   Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), (3) variation in the structure and
   composition of grassland habitats, and (4) a gradient of woodland cover
   in the landscape matrix. Tree cover at broad scales was found to have
   the greatest impact on parasitism while factors at finer scales were
   relatively unimportant. We found that for every 1 \% increase in tree
   cover within 1 km of Grasshopper Sparrow nests, the probability of
   parasitism decreases by 3 \%. Parasitism reduced clutch sizes and the
   number of Grasshopper Sparrows fledged, but survival rates were similar
   between non-parasitized and parasitized nests. Furthermore, simple
   population projection models indicated that parasitism has the greatest
   impact at moderate survival levels and can inhibit the resiliency of
   this population. Our results support the hypothesis that cowbirds prefer
   forest hosts, which may reduce parasitism rates on grassland birds in
   heterogeneous landscapes. Collectively, our findings suggest that the
   effect of cowbird parasitism may be greater for Grasshopper Sparrows
   than was previously thought.}},

Title = {{Management Intensity and Topography Determined Plant Diversity in
   Vineyards}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Vineyards are amongst the most intensive forms of agriculture often
   resulting in simplified landscapes where semi-natural vegetation is
   restricted to small scattered patches. However, a tendency toward a more
   sustainable management is stimulating research on biodiversity in these
   poorly investigated agro-ecosystems. The main aim of this study was to
   test the effect on plant diversity of management intensity and
   topography in vineyards located in a homogenous intensive hilly
   landscape. Specifically, this study evaluated the role of slope, mowing
   and herbicide treatments frequency, and nitrogen supply in shaping plant
   diversity and composition of life-history traits. The study was carried
   out in 25 vineyards located in the area of the Conegliano-Valdobbiadene
   DOCG (Veneto, NE Italy). In each vineyard, 10 plots were placed and the
   abundance of all vascular plants was recorded in each plot. Linear
   multiple regression was used to test the effect of management and
   topography on plant diversity. Management intensity and topography were
   both relevant drivers of plant species diversity patterns in our
   vineyards. The two most important factors were slope and mowing
   frequency that respectively yielded positive and negative effects on
   plant diversity. A significant interaction between these two factors was
   also demonstrated, warning against the detrimental effects of increasing
   mowing intensity on steep slope where plant communities are more
   diverse. The response of plant communities to mowing frequency is
   mediated by a process of selection of resistant growth forms, such in
   the case of rosulate and reptant species. The other two
   management-related factors tested in this study, number of herbicide
   treatments and N fertilization, were less influential. In general, our
   study corroborates the idea that some simple changes in farming
   activities, which are compatible with grape production, should be
   encouraged for improving the natural and cultural value of the landscape
   by maintaining and improving wild plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{We performed our study in the Dry Puna of the southern Peruvian Andes.
   Through a comparative approach we aimed to assess the effects of the two
   management systems, low grazing pressure by wild camelids vs. high
   grazing pressure by domestic livestock and periodic burning. Our general
   hypothesis was that the traditional high disturbance regime affects the
   dry Puna species diversity and composition through modifications of the
   magnitude of plant-plant-interactions and changes of the community
   structure due to shifts in species dominance. In 40 plots of 10 x 10 m,
   the cover value of each species was recorded and the species richness,
   floristic diversity, and community similarity of each treatment were
   compared. For each disturbance regime, differences of soil features
   (organic matter, carbon/nitrogen ratio, and potassium content) were
   tested. To evaluate plant plant interactions, 4 linear transect divided
   into 500 plots of 10 x 10 cm were laid out and co-occurrence analysis
   was performed. We found that different disturbance regimes were
   associated with differences in the floristic composition, and that the
   high disturbance condition had lower species diversity and evenness. A
   decrease of tall species such as Festuca orthophylla and increase of
   dwarf and spiny Tetraglochin cristatum shrubs was observed as well. In
   addition, different disturbance intensities caused differences in the
   functional composition of the plant communities, since species with
   avoidance strategies are selected by high grazing pressure. High
   disturbance intensity was also associated to differences of soil
   features and to different clumped spatial structure of the dry Puna. Our
   results indicate also that: positive interactions are often
   species-specific mainly depending on the features of nurse and
   beneficiary species; the importance of positive interaction is higher at
   low grazing pressure than at high disturbance intensity; the magnitude
   and direction of the herbivory-mediated facilitation processes may be
   traced back to the grazing pressure of wild camelids. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Dung beetles are indispensable in pasturelands, especially when poor
   efficiency of earthworms and irregular rainfall (e.g. under a
   Mediterranean climate) limit pad decomposition. Although observed and
   projected species range shifts and extinctions due to climate change
   have been documented for plants and animals, little effort has focused
   on the response of keystone species such as the scarab beetles of dung
   beetle decomposers. Our study aims to forecast the distribution of 37
   common Scarabaeidae dung beetle species in France, Portugal and Spain
   (i.e. more than half of the western European Scarabaeidae fauna) in
   relation to two climate change scenarios (A2 and B1) for the period
   leading to 2080. On average, 21 \% of the species should change in each
   50-km UTM grid cell. The highest faunistic turnover rate and a
   significant increase in species richness are expected in the north of
   the study area while a marked impoverishment is expected in the south,
   with little difference between scenarios. The potential enrichment of
   northern regions depends on the achievement of the northward shift of
   thermophilous species, and climate change is generally likely to reduce
   the current distribution of the majority of species. Under these
   conditions, the distribution of resource-i.e. the extent and
   distribution of pastures-will be a key factor limiting species'
   responses to climate change. The dramatic abandonment of extensive
   grazing across many low mountains of southern Europe may thus represent
   a serious threat to dung beetle distribution changes.}},

Abstract = {{To preserve biodiversity and ecosystem functions in a globally changing
   world it is crucial to understand the effect of land use on ecosystem
   processes such as pollination. Floral colouration is known to be central
   in plant-pollinator interactions. To date, it is still unknown whether
   land use affects the colouration of flowering plant communities. To
   assess the effect of land use on the diversity and composition of flower
   colours in temperate grasslands, we collected data on the number of
   flowering plant species, blossom cover and flower reflectance spectra
   from 69 plant communities in two German regions, Schwabische Alb (SA)
   and Hainich-Dun (HD). We analysed reflectance data of flower colours as
   they are perceived by honeybees and studied floral colour diversity
   based upon spectral loci of each flowering plant species in the Maxwell
   triangle. Before the first mowing, flower colour diversity decreased
   with increasing land-use intensity in SA, accompanied by a shift of mean
   flower colours of communities towards an increasing proportion of white
   blossom cover in both regions. By changing colour characteristics of
   grasslands, we suggest that increasing land-use intensity can affect the
   flower visitor fauna in terms of visitor behaviour and diversity. These
   changes may in turn influence plant reproduction in grassland plant
   communities. Our results indicate that land use is likely to affect
   communication processes between plants and flower visitors by altering
   flower colour traits.}},

Title = {{Elevated nitrogen effects on Bromus tectorum dominance and native plant

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Dominance of the widespread fire-altering invasive grass,
   Bromus tectorum, is markedly reduced at upper elevations in the Great
   Basin Desert. Here, we evaluated whether increased anthropogenic
   nitrogen (N) deposition would have an effect on species composition and
   ecosystem invasibility by B.tectorum at high elevations, and whether
   B.tectorum cover was associated with decreased native plant diversity.
   Location: Sagebrush steppe of the eastern Sierra Nevada, CA, US, at the
   western edge of the Great Basin Desert.
   Methods: We set up 54 paired plots, half of which were exposed to
   elevated N deposition (50kg center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1) at the
   time of snowmelt for 4yr) and half acted as controls, in areas differing
   in disturbance history (grazed, burned and grazed-burned). We monitored
   species composition each summer from 2008 to 2011 and then compared
   species richness, Shannon's diversity (H'), Simpson's dominance (D'),
   Simpson's evenness (E-1/D), B.tectorum dominance and community
   similarity (with ANOSIM and SIMPER analyses) by N treatment and
   disturbance history.
   Results: Species composition differed by disturbance history in all
   years (ANOSIM, P<0.05), and the grazed-burned plots consistently had the
   highest levels of B.tectorum dominance (P0.0003) and cover (P0.0001).
   Bromus tectorum cover was inversely related to native forb species
   richness (r=-0.44, P<0.0001), H'(r(s)=-0.73, P<0.0001), -ln(D')
   (r(s)=-0.75, P<0.0001) and E-1/D'(r(s)=-0.49, P<0.0001). We found no
   evidence that increased N deposition would affect native plant diversity
   after 4yr in this arid montane ecosystem, but the possibility of
   longer-term effects cannot be eliminated.
   Conclusions: Results suggest that high-elevation plant communities are
   already experiencing invasion impacts even though changes to the fire
   cycle have not yet occurred. In the most disturbed areas, B.tectorum
   cover is approaching the threshold for increased fire risk, which could
   result in more severe impacts at high elevations.}},

Title = {{Effects of changes in management on resistance and resilience in three

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Question: Diversification of grassland management is recommended as a
   tool for conservation of different taxonomic groups living in those
   habitats. How resistant and resilient are species-rich grasslands in
   terms of plant species richness and vegetation composition to
   short-term, small-scale perturbations caused by changes in management
   practice?
   Location: Bile Karpaty Mountains, SE Czech Republic.
   Methods: The experiment included the effect of six management regimes
   (mowing in June; mowing in September; mowing in June and September;
   mowing in June and high stubble left; no management; mowing in June and
   mulching). It was conducted in species-rich wooded grasslands in the
   White Carpathians Mts., Czech Republic, represented by three types of
   plant community: a Bromus erectus community (with high species richness
   and low productivity), a Molinia arundinacea community (with high
   species richness and high productivity), and a Calamagrostis epigejos
   community (with low species richness and high productivity). After 3yr,
   resistance was assessed, and traditional management (mowing once each
   year in June) was resumed; resilience was evaluated after three more
   years.
   Results: While the species-rich, unproductive Bromus community was
   relatively resistant to less intensive management in terms of species
   richness, and therefore its resilience could not be assessed, it changed
   substantially in terms of vegetation composition (maximum dissimilarity
   between control and abandoned plots was 63\%). The more productive
   Molinia and Calamagrostis communities lost up to 37\% of species due to
   abandonment, but not as a consequence of other changes management
   regimes. After the traditional management was resumed, resilience was
   higher in the Calamagrostis community than in the Molinia community.
   Vegetation composition was not affected by treatments.
   Conclusions: The results show that short-term abandonment causes loss of
   plant diversity in productive grasslands but not in less productive,
   species-rich grasslands in the short term. Other relaxed management
   regimes (e.g. high stubble and delayed mowing) were comparable with the
   control and can be used for a short time to increase diversity of
   management without an effect on plant species richness. However, further
   research is needed to assess the effects of these management practices
   when they are applied repeatedly or over the long term.}},

Title = {{Forest patches and the upward migration of timberline in the southern

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{305}},
Pages = {{204-211}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Montane plant species around the globe are predicted to shift their
   distributions upslope in response to increasing temperatures associated
   with climate change. In the tropical Andes, which are one of the most
   diverse and threatened of all biodiversity hotspots, many plant and
   animal species have already started to shift their distributions to
   higher elevations in response to warming. However, a variety of biotic
   and abiotic factors may stabilize Andean timberlines and halt further
   upslope migrations into the high elevation grasslands (referred to as
   ``puna{''} in southern Peru) above the forest. One possibility is that
   small forest patches that occur above-timberline throughout the Andes
   may facilitate forest expansion into newly suitable areas in the puna,
   yet little is known about the ecology or function of these patches. In
   this study, we examined seedling recruitment patterns, seed dispersal,
   and microclimate at the timberline, in and around above-timberline
   forest patches, and in the puna. The above-timberline forest patches had
   similar patterns of seed dispersal as the timberline but overal <1\% of
   captured seeds were dispersed 10 m into the puna. At both the patch
   edges and the forest timberline, seedling abundances were lower in the
   puna relative to the adjacent forest and forest-puna ecotone. This
   reduction may be a result of reduced seed dispersal across the
   forest-puna ecotone and/or decreased germination of dispersed seeds due
   to the harsh microclimatic conditions occurring in the puna (daily
   temperature fluctuations are greatly elevated in the puna relative to
   the forest and frost events are more frequent and severe). While
   increasing temperatures associated with climate change may ameliorate
   some of the severe climatic conditions occurring in the puna, it will
   not directly affect other potential recruitment limitations such as
   reduced seed dispersal, high levels of UV radiation, and anthropogenic
   activities (cattle grazing and fires) in the puna. With the reduction of
   anthropogenic activities, above-timberline forest patches may serve as
   nucleating foci for future forest expansion into the puna. However, our
   results indicate that any upslope migration of the timberline into the
   puna will likely occur at a rate that is slower than what is required to
   keep pace with warming because recruitment is restricted to a narrow
   strip along the forest-puna borders. Slowed forest expansion into the
   puna could act as a barrier to the upslope migration of Andean cloud
   forest species leading to extreme losses of Andean biodiversity. (C)

Title = {{Shrub removal facilitates recovery of wetland species in a rewetted fen}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{294-308}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Drainage and shrub expansion are the main threats to the biodiversity of
   fens and fen meadows, whereas rewetting and the removal of shrubby
   species are frequently applied restoration measures. We examine whether
   removal of shrubs enhances recovery of target species in a degraded fen
   subjected to moderate rewetting. The study was located in the drained
   fen Calowanie (central Poland), where remnants of open fen communities
   and willow-invaded fens exist in former turf-pits, surrounded by
   degraded meadows on dried peat. All these three habitat types were
   included in a monitoring grid, which covered an area of 2.2 ha. Within
   55 quadrats of 20 m x 20 m we monitored occurrence of 52 species, i.e.
   two groups of target species (fen indicators and wet meadow indicators)
   and indicators of two failure scenarios (degraded fen indicators and
   eutrophic wetland indicators), during sixy ears following shrub removal,
   rewetting and re-application of conservational mowing, using a 3-step
   ordinal abundance scale. NMDS ordination revealed a gradual convergence
   of shrub removal plots and reference plots. We noticed significant
   effects of year and habitat type on all indicator groups, but only fen
   indicators have shown a clear (increasing) trend within shrub removal
   plots. Degraded fen indicators (ruderal and opportunistic species)
   initially expanded on shrub removal plots, but this effect disappeared
   in the following years. We conclude that shrub removal enhances
   establishment of target species in a moderately drained and then
   rewetted fen and attribute this effect to lowered competition for light.
   However, given high costs of this method and long-lasting problems with
   shrub resprouts, we recommend applying shrub removal only to recently
   overgrown sites, which still retained high botanical diversity. Heavily
   degraded fen meadows did not react on the increase of moisture, which
   indicates that more advanced restoration measures, such as top soil
   removal are needed there. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We studied long-term (25-31 years) dynamics of alpine communities at the
   Teberda Reserve, NW Caucasus, Russia, to test the following hypotheses:
   (1) lower altitude species increase and high altitude species decrease
   their abundance as a consequence of climate warming; (2) such changes in
   abundance are more significant in communities with short growth season
   (due to persistent snow cover) compared to exposed communities; (3)
   species with similar changes in abundance have similar functional
   traits. Four alpine communities with different positions in relief were
   considered in order of winter snow cover: alpine lichen heaths (ALH),
   Festuca varia grasslands (FVG), Geranium-Hedysarum meadows (GHM), and
   snowbed communities (SBC).
   The altitudinal distribution of species significantly predicted the
   direction and degree of changes in species abundance in GHM (p < 0.001),
   SBC (p < 0.02) and FVG (p < 0.05) with high altitude species decreasing
   and low altitude species increasing their abundance. Mean altitudes of
   significantly decreasing species exceeded that of increasing species by
   ca. 100-130 m in FVG, GHM and SBC. There were no species traits or trait
   combinations that consistently predicted their changing abundance in
   ALH, FVG and SBC. In GHM increasing species tended to have leaves with
   higher SLA (i.e. softer leaves) and lower root nitrogen content. The
   observed dynamic processes may be caused partly by recent climate
   warming, although slow recovery from historic grazing pressure may also
   play a role. Regardless of the causes driving the plant species' upward
   shift, communities experiencing high snow accumulation (SBC, GHM) seem
   to be more vulnerable to changes in structure and composition.}},

Abstract = {{Wood-pastures are among the oldest land-use types in Europe and have
   high ecological and cultural importance. They are under rapid decline
   all over Europe because of changes in land use, tree cutting, and lack
   of regeneration. In this study we characterized the structure, condition
   and threats of wood-pastures in a traditional rural region in Romania.
   Forty-two wood-pastures were surveyed, as well as 15 forest sites for
   comparison. All wood-pasture sites were described via four groups of
   variables: condition, management, site, and landscape context. Forest
   sites were dominated by Hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and Beech (Fagus
   sylvatica), whereas wood-pastures were dominated by Oak (Quercus sp.)
   and various species of fruit trees. Most wood-pastures contained trees
   classified as `ancient' but no such trees were found in forests. The
   proportion of dead trees was positively related to forest cover within
   300 m around the wood-pasture. Models that included management, site and
   landscape-related variables best explained the prelevance of Oak, Beech,
   Hornbeam and Pear trees in wood-pastures. Large oaks and horn-beams were
   more likely to be dead or affected by uncontrolled pasture burning than
   small oaks and other tree species. Our results show that ancient
   wood-pastures are common in this rural region, and they may be more
   common in Eastern Europe than previously thought. There is an urgent
   need for research, legal recognition and conservation management of
   wood-pastures as distinct landscape elements for their cultural,
   ecological and agricultural importance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A unique long-term phenological data set of over 110000 records of 1st
   cutting dates for haymaking across Germany, spanning the years 1951-2011
   was examined. In addition, we analyzed a long-term data set in the
   beginning of flowering of meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis) covering
   the last 20years. We tested whether hay-cutting dates (based on a human
   decision when to cut) showed trends, temperature relationships and
   spatial distribution similar to the development of this grassland
   species, and if these trends could be related to climate change. The
   timing of 1st hay cut was strongly influenced (P<0.001) by altitude,
   latitude and longitude, revealing in particular an east-west gradient.
   Over the past 60years, there have been changes in the timing of hay
   cutting, with the majority of German federal states having significant
   (P<0.05) advances of approximately 1day per decade. Overall, the
   response to mean March-May temperature was highly significant (-2.87days
   degrees C-1; P<0.001). However, in the last 20years, no federal state
   experienced a significant advance and two were even significantly
   delayed. The temperature response in this post-1991 period became less
   or non-significant for most of the federal states. We suggest that
   differences in agricultural land use and unequal uptakes of
   Agri-Environment Schemes (AES, which encourage later cutting) were
   likely to be responsible for the regional differences, while the general
   increase in AES appears to have confounded the overall trend in hay
   cutting in the last 20years. Trends over time and responses to
   temperature were small relative to those associated with the phenology
   of meadow foxtail. The advance in phenology of this species is greater
   than the advance in hay cutting, implying that hay cutting may not be
   keeping pace with a changing climate, which may have a positive effect
   on grassland ecology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes increasingly individualized herding behavior after
   the implementation of a grazing ban policy in northern China based on
   empirical research in 12 pastoralist villages. The findings reveal that
   de-collectivization of pastureland has not necessarily led to direct
   changes in individual land use strategies. Instead, a wider
   institutional context influenced by the implementation of a grazing ban
   has led to more individualized herding and increased short-term
   considerations of profit maximization in the study area, both of which
   are seen to undermine the sustainable use of pastureland. Based on our
   observations of herder responses to privatization, the grazing ban and a
   short experiment with lifting the grazing ban, we propose that the
   special characteristics of grassland and pastoralism call for
   institutions that facilitate locally originated pasture land use
   practice (e.g., co-operative herding, self-organized management) instead
   of exclusive reliance on a rigidly defined private property regime
   focused on fixed property boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents findings of the first systematic analysis of aquatic
   biotic assemblages in the source region of the Yellow and Yangtze
   Rivers. It provides an initial basis with which to select representative
   organisms as indicators to assess the aquatic ecological status of
   rivers in this region. Macroinvertebrates are considered to be good
   indicators of long-term environmental changes due to their restricted
   range and persistence over time. Field investigations of
   macroinvertebrates were conducted in August 2009 in the source region of
   the Yellow River, and in July 2010 in the source region of the Yangtze
   River. Altogether 68 taxa of macroinvertebrates belonging to 29 families
   and 59 genera were identified. Among them were 8 annelids, 5 mollusks,
   54 arthropods and 1 other animal. In the source region of the Yellow
   River, taxa number, density and biomass of macroinvertebrates were 50,
   329 individuals m(-2) and 0.3966 g dry weight m(-2), respectively.
   Equivalent figures for the source region of the Yangtze River were 29,
   59 individuals m(-2) and 0.0307 g dry weight m(-2). The lower benthic
   animal resources in the source region of the Yangtze River are ascribed
   to higher altitude, higher sediment concentration and wetland
   degradation. Preliminary findings of this exploratory study indicate
   that hydroelectric power stations had a weak impact on benthic dwellers
   but wetland degradation caused by a series of human activities had a
   catastrophic impact on survival of macroinvertebrates. Ecological
   protection measures such as conservative grazing and vegetation
   management are required to minimize grassland degradation and
   desertification, and reduce soil erosion rate and river sediment
   discharge.}},

Abstract = {{Seasonal alpine grazing is organised around the migration of livestock
   between alpine pastures in the summer season and lower permanently
   settled regions the rest of the year. Seasonal alpine grazing fulfils
   important functions for the environment, agriculture and regional
   economy, as well as for society. The Swiss Agricultural Sectoral
   Information and Forecasting System (SILAS) is used to forecast
   pasture-management trends as well as analyse their economic impact on
   Swiss agriculture and biotic communities. Model results show the great
   economic importance of alpine grazing for the farms in the mountain
   region, where roughly one-third of total factor income is linked to
   summering. The income contribution of alpine grazing can also be
   interpreted as the reward for the provision of public goods which are
   directly or indirectly linked to alpine grazing. Despite the high income
   contribution for farmers in the permanently settled mountain area, model
   results show that transhumance payments do not prevent a decrease in the
   number of summered animals. This is mainly due to the abolition of the
   alpine milk quota in Switzerland, which reduces the competitiveness of
   milk production in the alpine area. A decline in the number of grazing
   animals affects the maintenance of open landscape and the existence and
   variety of species. The effects can be beneficial for the high nature
   values associated with established agricultural practices, if the same
   area will continue to be grazed, but less intensively than before. The
   effects can be also unfavourable if fewer areas will be grazed, but with
   the same or a higher intensity as before. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Cultivation and overgrazing can cause desertification of sandy
   grasslands in arid and semiarid regions. However, little was known about
   their effects on soil macro-fauna. In this study, we described the soil
   macro-faunal community structure at cultivated, grazed, and ungrazed
   sites in the semiarid Horqin steppe, northern China. Soil bulk density
   was 1.61gcm(-3) at grazed sites, similar to that at cultivated sites.
   Cultivation reduced soil organic carbon and total nitrogen by 36 and
   46\%, respectively, compared with grazed grassland. Grazing exclusion
   decreased soil bulk density and pH by 16 and 3\%, respectively, and
   increased soil moisture, soil organic carbon and total nitrogen by 75,
   22, and 4\%, respectively, compared with grazed grassland. Cultivated
   and grazed sites had similar group richness (9 and 10 groups,
   respectively) and Shannon's index (1.98 and 1.93, respectively); both
   were significantly lower there than at ungrazed sites. Simpson's index
   at grazed sites was 0.18, markedly higher than at ungrazed (0.12) and
   cultivated (0.16) sites. There were no significant differences in soil

   grazed sites was 24\% higher than at cultivated sites and 30\% lower

   and the C/N ratio significantly affected the community structure.
   Specific macro-faunal groups responded to the different living
   conditions by adaptation to or selection of specific habitats. For
   example, the Thomisidae, Reduviidae, Staphilinidae, and Curculionidae
   responded negatively to increasing soil bulk density and all of these
   except the Curculionidae responded negatively to increasing soil
   temperature. These groups have important implications for the soil food
   web, and thus for the soil ecosystems. Our results suggested that
   cultivation and continuous grazing negatively affected soil properties
   and macro-faunal diversity, whereas livestock exclusion enhanced soil
   macro-faunal assemblies and improved their biodiversity. Changes in
   these assemblies might be potential indicators of ecosystem recovery and
   management impacts. Supplementary materials are available for this

Abstract = {{The benefits of low input farming on biodiversity and ecosystem services
   are already well-established, however most of these studies focus only
   on the focal field scales. We aimed to study whether these benefits
   exist at the whole farm scale, to find the main environmental driving
   effects on biodiversity at the whole farm scale in farms of different
   grassland grazing intensity, applying three well-known species diversity
   indicator groups of different ecological traits.
   Edaphic (earthworms), epigeic (spiders) and flying (bees) taxa were
   sampled in each identified habitat type within 18 low-input farms in
   Central Hungary, 2010. The number of habitat types, the number of
   grassland plots, the cumulative area of grasslands and habitat type had
   an effect on the species richness and abundance of spiders, while
   grassland grazing intensity influenced the species richness of bees.
   Both bees and spiders were sensitive to vegetation and weather
   conditions, resulting in more bees on flower-rich farms and those having
   higher temperature; and more spiders on farms with more heterogeneous
   vegetation structure and in low-wind areas. Relatively few earthworms
   were found in the whole study, and their abundance was not influenced by
   any of the farm composition and management variables.
   We conclude that local field management (grazing intensity of grassland
   patches) can have a farm scale effect, detectable on species diversity
   indicators that have high dispersal ability and strong connection to
   grasslands as important foraging sites (bees). However, other farmland
   biota (spiders) is also strongly determined by farmland composition and
   habitat diversity, therefore the maintenance of a mosaic within-farm
   habitat structure is strongly recommended. The application of earthworms
   as farmland composition or management indicators is strongly restricted
   because of their special needs of soil conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi form symbiotic associations with most
   plant species in terrestrial ecosystems, and are affected by
   environmental variations. To reveal the impact of disturbance on an AM
   fungal community under future global warming, we examined the abundance
   and community composition of AM fungi in both soil and mixed roots in an
   alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. Warming and grazing
   had no significant effect on AM root colonization, spore density and
   extraradical hyphal density. A total of 65 operational taxonomic units
   (OTUs) of AM fungi were identified from soil and roots using molecular
   techniques. AM fungal OTU richness was higher in soil (54 OTUs) than in
   roots (34 OTUs), and some AM fungi that differed between soil and roots,
   showed significantly biased occurrence to warming or grazing. Warming
   and grazing did not significantly affect AM fungal OTU richness in soil,
   but warming with grazing significantly increased AM fungal OTU richness
   in roots compared to the grazing-only treatment. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling analysis showed that the AM fungal community
   composition was significantly different between soil and roots, and was
   significantly affected by grazing in roots, whereas in soil it was
   significantly affected by warming and plant species richness. The
   results suggest that the AM fungal community responds differently to
   warming and grazing in soil compared with roots. This study provides
   insights into the role of AM fungi under global environmental change
   scenarios in alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{178}},

Abstract = {{In the Czech Republic, the number of cattle has decreased by about 60\%
   between the years 1990 and 2010 and one major question is therefore, how
   to manage mountain grasslands with reduced livestock and demand for
   forage. One possible alternative is low-cost mulching, which is defined
   as the crushing of aboveground biomass, which is then evenly spread onto
   the ground. In view of a lack of data on the effects of mulching, we
   established an experiment with different cutting and mulching regimes on
   mountain Festuca rubra grassland in 1997 and monitored plant species
   composition over twelve years.
   Treatments with a similar response of plant species composition were (i)
   unmanaged control and grassland mulched once a year in September; (ii)
   grassland mulched once a year in May and in July; (iii) grassland
   mulched twice a year in June and August and grassland mulched three
   times a year in May, July and September; (iv) grassland cut twice a year
   with biomass removal in June and August.
   We concluded that mulching performed at least twice a year can
   substitute for cutting management in low productive grassland, without
   substantial loss of plant species richness and diversity. Mulching only
   in September affected plant species composition of the grassland in a
   similar way to no management, therefore, mulching performed only in
   September can be used only for prevention of grassland encroachment by
   shrubs and trees. The majority of changes in plant species composition
   developed during the first five years, thus, experiments to study the
   effects of management on grasslands must be performed for at least this
   length. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{Rapid 21st-century climate change may lead to large population decreases
   and extinction in tropical montane cloud forest species in the Andes.
   While prior research has focused on species migrations per se, ecotones
   may respond to different environmental factors than species. Even if
   species can migrate in response to climate change, if ecotones do not
   they can function as hard barriers to species migrations, making ecotone
   migrations central to understanding species persistence under scenarios
   of climate change. We examined a 42-year span of aerial photographs and
   high resolution satellite imagery to calculate migration rates of
   timberline-the grassland-forest ecotone-inside and outside of protected
   areas in the high Peruvian Andes. We found that timberline in protected
   areas was more likely to migrate upward in elevation than in areas with
   frequent cattle grazing and fire. However, rates in both protected (0.24
   m yr(-1)) and unprotected (0.05 m yr(-1)) areas are only 0.5-2.3\% of
   the rates needed to stay in equilibrium with projected climate by 2100.
   These ecotone migration rates are 12.5 to 110 times slower than the
   observed species migration rates within the same forest, suggesting a
   barrier to migration for mid-and high-elevation species. We anticipate
   that the ecotone will be a hard barrier to migration under future
   climate change, leading to drastic population and biodiversity losses in
   the region unless intensive management steps are taken.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Understanding factors driving the ecology of N cycling microbial
   communities is of central importance for sustainable land use. In this
   study we report changes of abundance of denitrifiers, nitrifiers and
   nitrogen-fixing microorganisms (based on qPCR data for selected
   functional genes) in response to different land use intensity levels and
   the consequences for potential turnover rates. We investigated selected
   grassland sites being comparable with respect to soil type and climatic
   conditions, which have been continuously treated for many years as
   intensely used meadows (IM), intensely used mown pastures (IP) and
   extensively used pastures (EP), respectively. The obtained data were
   linked to above ground biodiversity pattern as well as water extractable
   fractions of nitrogen and carbon in soil. Shifts in land use intensity
   changed plant community composition from systems dominated by
   s-strategists in extensive managed grasslands to c-strategist dominated
   communities in intensive managed grasslands. Along the different types
   of land use intensity, the availability of inorganic nitrogen regulated
   the abundance of bacterial and archaeal ammonia oxidizers. In contrast,
   the amount of dissolved organic nitrogen determined the abundance of
   denitrifiers (nirS and nirK). The high abundance of nifH carrying
   bacteria at intensive managed sites gave evidence that the amounts of
   substrates as energy source outcompete the high availability of
   inorganic nitrogen in these sites. Overall, we revealed that abundance
   and function of microorganisms involved in key processes of inorganic N
   cycling (nitrification, denitrification and N fixation) might be
   independently regulated by different abiotic and biotic factors in
   response to land use intensity.}},

   effects on bird densities, we followed a two-step approach. First, we
   measured vegetation micro-patterns (mosaic of lower vegetation and
   taller patches at 4x4 m) around Common Redshank Tringa totanus and
   Eurasian Oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus nests and at random sites
   paired with these nests sites to judge suitability of micro-patterns for
   nest building. Secondly, we measured micro-patterns at 120 permanent
   plots in five different experimental grazing treatments to determine how
   grazing affects micro-patterns. We compared low stocking density of both
   cattle and of horses, high stocking density of cattle and of horses, and
   intermittent grazing with a high stocking density of cattle (i.e. yearly
   intervals of grazing and no grazing). Redshank and Oystercatcher nests
   occurred in sites with taller vegetation and more pronounced
   micro-patterns than found at random sites. Paddocks grazed with low
   densities of livestock or with a high density intermittent grazing
   treatment had micro-patterns preferred by the birds. We conclude that
   Redshanks and Oystercatchers may benefit in terms of potential nest
   sites from grazing at low livestock densities or at intermittent
   stocking densities through effects of grazing on micro-patterns in the
   vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Recent opposition to the rangeland management paradigm of achieving
   uniform, moderate grazing across entire landscapes has emerged because
   heterogeneity is recognized as the foundation of biodiversity, ecosystem
   resilience, and multifunctionality of agricultural landscapes.
   Agriculture production goals appear to drive the traditional rangeland
   management focus on homogeneity and uniformity. To determine if
   preference for homogeneity is a broadly applicable social construct or
   one limited to agricultural producers, we determined preferences for
   heterogeneous grassland landscapes expressed by three study populations
   managers of working lands (ranchers), natural resource professionals
   (grassland/rangeland specialists), and the general population living in
   rangeland regions within the US Great Plains. We distributed surveys
   that included photographs of landscapes and patterned images to assess
   preference. Preference for heterogeneous landscapes among ranchers,
   natural resource professionals, and the general population in our study
   area were generally consistent with the central paradigm of managing
   rangeland for homogeneity. However, we discovered that people, across
   geographic location and population group, clearly prefer heterogeneous
   patterned images to homogeneous patterned images This suggests that
   preference for homogeneity is acquired.}},

Title = {{Does organic grassland farming benefit plant and arthropod diversity at
   the expense of yield and soil fertility?}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{177}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Organic management is one of the most popular strategies to reduce
   negative environmental impacts of intensive agriculture. However, little
   is known about benefits for biodiversity and potential worsening of
   yield under organic grasslands management across different grassland
   types, i.e. meadow, pasture and mown pasture. Therefore, we studied the
   diversity of vascular plants and foliage-living arthropods (Coleoptera,
   Araneae, Heteroptera, Auchenorrhyncha), yield, fodder quality, soil
   phosphorus concentrations and land-use intensity of organic and
   conventional grasslands across three study regions in Germany.
   Furthermore, all variables were related to the time since conversion to
   organic management in order to assess temporal developments reaching up
   to 18 years. Arthropod diversity was significantly higher under organic
   than conventional management, although this was not the case for
   Araneae, Heteroptera and Auchenorrhyncha when analyzed separately. On
   the contrary, arthropod abundance, vascular plant diversity and also
   yield and fodder quality did not considerably differ between organic and
   conventional grasslands. Analyses did not reveal differences in the
   effect of organic management among grassland types. None of the recorded
   abiotic and biotic parameters showed a significant trend with time since
   transition to organic management, except soil organic phosphorus
   concentrations which decreased with time. This implies that permanent
   grasslands respond slower and probably weaker to organic management than
   crop fields do. However, as land-use intensity and inorganic soil
   phosphorus concentrations were significantly lower in organic
   grasslands, overcoming seed and dispersal limitation by re-introducing
   plant species might be needed to exploit the full ecological potential
   of organic grassland management. We conclude that although organic
   management did not automatically increase the diversity of all studied
   taxa, it is a reasonable and useful way to support agro-biodiversity.

Abstract = {{Grazing is one of the most important factors influencing community
   structure and productivity in natural grasslands. Understanding why and
   how grazing pressure changes species diversity is essential for the
   preservation and restoration of biodiversity in grasslands. We use
   heavily grazed subalpine meadows in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau to test
   the hypothesis that grazer exclusion alters plant diversity by changing
   inter- and intraspecific species distributions. Using recently developed
   spatial analyses combined with detailed ramet mapping of entire plant
   communities (91 species), we show striking differences between grazed
   and fenced areas that emerged at scales of just one meter. Species
   richness was similar at very small scales (0.0625m(2)), but at larger
   scales diversity in grazed areas fell below 75\% of corresponding fenced
   areas. These differences were explained by differences in spatial
   distributions; intra- and interspecific associations changed from
   aggregated at small scales to overdispersed in the fenced plots, but
   were consistently aggregated in the grazed ones. We conclude that
   grazing enhanced inter- and intraspecific aggregations and maintained
   high diversity at small scales, but caused decreased turnover in species
   at larger scales, resulting in lower species richness. Our study
   provides strong support to the theoretical prediction that inter- and
   intraspecific aggregation produces local spatial patterns that scale-up
   to affect species diversity in a community. It also demonstrates that
   the impacts of grazing can manifest through this mechanism, lowering
   diversity by reducing spatial turnover in species. Finally, it
   highlights the ecological and physiological plant processes that are
   likely responding to grazing and thereby altering aggregation patterns,
   providing new insights for monitoring, and mediating the impacts of
   grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Calcareous grasslands represent local hotspots of biodiversity in large
   parts of Central and Northern Europe. They support a great number of
   rare species which are adapted to these xerothermic habitats. Due to
   massive changes in land use, calcareous grasslands have become a rare
   habitat type and their conservation has been given a high priority in
   the habitats directive of the European Union. It is well known that
   grassland management may affect biodiversity substantially. However, the
   quality of calcareous grasslands is also influenced by abiotic
   conditions, such as aspect (i.e. sun exposure), which affects the local
   mesoclimate. We studied the combined effects of aspect and grassland
   management on Orthoptera diversity on 16 sites in Central Germany, in an
   unbalanced crossed design with three factors: aspect, management type
   and management intensity. For both response variables (diversity and
   abundance) we obtained a similar pattern. South-facing pastures
   maintained a greater diversity than north-facing pastures, but both had
   a greater diversity than extensively used meadows. Intensively used
   meadows maintained the lowest diversity and abundances. A multivariate
   analysis revealed that the abundance of rare Orthoptera species
   correlated with bare ground cover and forb cover, both of which were
   greatest at south-facing pastures. Our results suggest that grazing is a
   more suitable management for maintaining a high biodiversity in
   calcareous grasslands than mowing. Moreover, the mesoclimate (in this
   studied measured by its surrogate: aspect) is a crucial factor
   determining species richness and needs to be considered in reserve
   planning.}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) provide a number of ecosystem
   services as important members of the soil microbial community.
   Increasing evidence suggests AMF diversity is at least partially
   controlled by the identities of plants in the host plant neighborhood.
   However, much of this evidence comes from greenhouse studies or work in
   invaded systems dominated by single plant species, and has not been
   tested in species-rich grasslands. We worked in 67 grasslands spread
   across the three German Biodiversity Exploratories that are managed
   primarily as pastures and meadows, and collected data on AMF
   colonization, AMF richness, AMF community composition, plant diversity,
   and land use around focal Plantago lanceolata plants. We analyzed the
   data collected within each Exploratory (ALB Schwabische Alb, HAI
   Hainich-Dun, SCH Schorfheide-Chorin) separately, and used variance
   partitioning to quantify the contribution of land use, host plant
   neighborhood, and spatial arrangement to the effect on AMF community
   composition. We performed canonical correspondence analysis to quantify
   the effect of each factor independently by removing the variation
   explained by the other factors. AMF colonization declined with
   increasing land use intensity (LUI) along with concurrent increases in
   non-AMF, suggesting that the ability of AMF to provide protection from
   pathogens declined under high LUI. In ALB and HAI mowing frequency and
   percent cover of additional P. lanceolata in the host plant neighborhood
   were important for AMF community composition. The similar proportional
   contribution of land use and host neighborhood to AMF community
   composition in a focal plant rhizosphere suggests that the diversity of
   this important group of soil microbes is similarly sensitive to changes
   at large and small scales.}},

Title = {{Sustainability of holistic and conventional cattle ranching in the
   seasonally dry tropics of Chiapas, Mexico}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{38-48}},

Abstract = {{Conventional cattle ranching in the lowlands of Chiapas, Mexico
   typically employs extensive grazing, annual pasture burns and frequent
   applications of agrochemicals, threatening biodiversity and long-term
   productivity. A small group of innovative ranchers in the Central
   Valleys are converting to holistic management through careful land-use
   planning, rotational grazing, diversified forage, and diminished use of
   purchased inputs. We compared the sustainability of 18 conventional and
   seven holistic, dual-purpose ranches, using three sets of sustainability
   metrics. First, we combined semistructured interviews and field
   observations to better describe the two productions systems and to
   calculate an ``Organic Conversion Index{''} (OCI), combining economic,
   social, technological and environmental indicators. Holistic ranchers
   have more pasture divisions, higher grazing pressure, greater lengths of
   time between pasture burns, greater milk productivity, larger forest
   reserves, lower cow and calf mortality, purchase less hay and feed, and
   use less herbicides and pesticides than their conventional neighbors
   (T-tests and Fisher's Exact Tests; all p < 0.05). OCI was greater
   (T-test, p < 0.0005) for holistic ranches (81.8 +/- 4.6\% compliance
   with organic standards), than for conventional ranches (32.1 +/- 9.0\%
   compliance), with holistic ranches demonstrating superiority for nine of
   ten OCI indicators. Second, drawing on data from the same interviews, we
   conducted ``emergy{''} analysis to quantify the embodied energy of
   inputs, outputs and sustainability of the ranching systems. The Emergy
   Yield Ratio, an index of a systems emergy throughput relative to the
   emergy in purchased inputs, was marginally higher in holistic ranches
   (T-test; p = 0.07), but became significant when only ranches >= 40 ha
   were analyzed (p = 0.04) and when government assistance (mostly in the
   form of machinery) was removed from the calculations (p = 0.008).
   Holistic ranches exhibited marginally higher Emergy Sustainability
   Indices, a measure of system yield relative to environmental impact, for
   all ranches combined (p = 0.07) and for ranches >= 40 ha (p = 0.06).
   Third, we sampled vegetation and soils on seven holistic and seven
   conventional ranches. We found higher soil respiration, deeper topsoil,
   increased earthworm presence, more tightly closed herbaceous canopies
   (all p < 0.05), and marginally greater forage availability (p = 0.053)
   in holistic ranches. Other variables, including soil compaction, soil
   chemistry and pasture tree cover, did not differ significantly between
   groups. These data are a snapshot of long, complex processes.
   Nonetheless, these complementary metrics combine to suggest that
   holistic management strategies are leading to greater ecological and
   economic sustainability. This production model merits further study for
   potential broader application as well as greater attention from decision
   makers concerned with ranching and the environment. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Natural steppes in European agricultural landscapes are characterized by
   high biotic richness but are subject to fragmentation and associated
   edge effects. Edge effects on species richness were investigated at an
   ecotone from a pine plantation to a short-grass steppe in Eastern
   Austria for eleven invertebrate taxa differentiated into habitat guilds
   based on known live-history strategies of individual species (grassland
   species, forest species, generalist species), including Red-Listed and
   non-threatened grassland species. The large size of the studied
   grassland site provided an opportunity to test edge effects in the
   absence of confounding factors and to a gradient length of 208 m into
   the grassland habitat along a clear-cut border to a pine plantation. All
   sampling was done by pitfall trapping. Species richness of habitat
   guilds, but not total richness, was effectively explained by biotic
   variables reflecting the influence of shading in particular (i.e. soil
   temperature sums). Total species richness showed a bimodal response
   pattern, with increases towards the habitat edge and interior grassland
   habitat. Habitat guilds showed diverging responses to distances from the
   edge, but no saturation in species richness, with a continuum of edge
   effects across the entire distance of the grassland samples. Our
   findings contrast those of previous investigations based on samples
   taken from smaller patches and across shorter distances from the edge.
   Methodological and conservation implications are discussed.}},

Title = {{Assessing the impact of land abandonment, nitrogen enrichment and

Journal = {{BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{10, SI}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Semi-natural calcareous grasslands are of great conservation interest
   because of their high species richness, but they are threatened by land
   abandonment and nitrogen eutrophication. These plant communities evolved
   as a result of a long history of human activity, which generated and
   maintained these habitats by extensive grazing and mowing. Calcareous
   grasslands are listed as a priority for conservation in the EC Habitats
   Directive. However, the effects of different management regimes,
   nitrogen enrichment, and soil-borne pathogens on plant species diversity
   are less clear for grasslands of the Mediterranean Basin, compared to
   meadows in Northern and Central Europe. In this study, we assessed the
   impact of land abandonment, nitrogen enrichment, and fairy-ring fungi on
   species diversity in semi-natural grasslands found in the Mediterranean
   Basin by comparing the available literature with findings from recent
   studies carried out in Central Italy. In a series of field experiments,
   the cutting of abandoned grassland consistently reduced the living
   biomass of the dominant perennial grasses, such as Brachypodium rupestre
   and Bromus erectus, and promoted a rapid increase in species richness
   and diversity by allowing the establishment of rare species. There was a
   similar, but less effective, restoration of species diversity and
   composition in mowed grassland after litter removal. We also show that
   nitrogen enrichment at levels comparable to atmospheric deposition
   depresses species diversity, which also hampers the positive effects of
   litter removal. Our findings are consistent with previous results
   achieved in Northern and Central Europe, which however, mainly focused
   on grasslands with intermediate to high primary productivity levels. The
   limited availability of data from low-productivity, drought-prone
   Mediterranean grasslands requires further studies to assess the impact
   of land abandonment and nitrogen eutrophication in such ecosystems.
   Finally, we discuss the role of fairy-ring fungi in the maintenance of
   plant diversity in species-rich grassland. We show that fairy-ring fungi
   (e.g. Agaricus campestris) critically affect the spatial distribution
   and diversity of coexisting plant species. By killing the dominant
   perennial herbs, these radially growing plant pathogens produce empty
   niches for rare, short-lived species, thus affecting the vegetation
   pattern. Overall, our results are of interest for environmental
   managers, as they provide guidelines for the restoration of abandoned
   areas and the conservation of these species-rich habitats.}},

Title = {{Riparian vegetation communities change rapidly following passive
   restoration at a northern Utah stream}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{371-377}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Riparian vegetation may recover quickly from disturbance when the
   disturbance vector is removed or reduced. Grazing is a disturbance that
   removes plant biomass through herbivory, while overgrazing is a more
   severe disturbance that can deplete plant propagule pools and inhibit
   plant community recovery. We tested the hypothesis that riparian
   vegetation communities can shift quickly from ruderal grasslands to
   hydrophytic shrubs and graminoids when grazing is largely eliminated
   from riparian areas. We used a before-after-control study design to
   collect vegetation community data at six restored reaches and two grazed
   control reaches prior to and immediately following the construction of a
   cattle exclosure. We identified trends in Carex and Salix species
   abundance and quantified shifts in riparian vegetation community
   composition across time at each reach using PERMANOVA, multi-level
   pattern analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling. Vegetation
   composition changed rapidly in the four years following removal of
   grazing disturbance. Indicator species for all impact reaches shifted
   away from grazing tolerant graminoids and forbs, and toward hydrophytic
   graminoid and shrub species. Over the same timespan control reach
   indicator species remained grazing-tolerant graminoids and forbs. There
   was little change in Salix abundance over time at control or impact
   reaches but Carex abundance increased at restored reaches. We conclude
   that herbaceous plant communities may recover rapidly following the
   removal of grazing disturbance, but that woody species may lag in
   recovery without active vegetation manipulation. We postulate that low
   woody-species recruitment may affect the potential of the riparian zone
   to quickly shade stream channels and facilitate undercut bank formation,
   common riparian restoration objectives. To prevent halted riparian
   succession, designers should proactively identify potential limitations
   to woody vegetation colonization. We close discussing active approaches
   to overcome stalled riparian ecosystem development and suggest metrics
   for assessing woody species recovery. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing can be a means to maintain biodiversity in grasslands,
   but the outcome for vegetation structure and species composition depends
   on livestock type and grazing regime. This study aims at disentangling
   the effects of plant functional-group abundance and livestock type on
   the above- and below-ground biomass and N allocation in temperate
   pastures. We investigated the effects of cattle, sheep and mixed
   stocking on above-ground biomass (AGB) and belowground biomass (BGB) and
   plant N pools in a replicated grazing experiment in two pasture
   community types with different plant functional-group abundance (diverse
   vs. grass-dominated swards). In the six treatments, AGB was reduced up
   to 80\% compared with an ungrazed control. Cattle reduced AGB to a
   larger extent than sheep in diverse pastures (80 vs 44\% reduction)
   while sheep grazing tended to do so in grass-dominated pastures (57 vs
   46\% reduction); mixed stocking led to intermediate values. Grazing
   reduced AGB more than the N pool in AGB, thus lowering the biomass C/N
   ratio relative to the ungrazed control. Neither BGB nor the N pool in
   BGB differed between the grazing treatments and the control plots. We
   conclude that livestock type and functional-group abundance are
   interacting factors that influence plant biomass and N pools in swards
   of managed temperate pastures. The contrasting biomass removal rates of
   cattle and sheep could be used to increase the structural heterogeneity
   and total plant species pool of pastures by keeping different livestock
   species in neighbouring patches.}},

Abstract = {{1. Frequent and extensive burning practices coupled with intensive
   grazing management are known to impact negatively on the vegetation
   diversity of grassland ecosystems. Few studies have investigated the
   impacts on spider diversity and community structure as a result of these
   management practices, and no studies have been conducted in high
   mountain grasslands on how these spider assemblages are influenced by
   this form of management.
   2. Here, we present the results of a study conducted in the Mpumalanga
   grasslands on the eastern escarpment of South Africa. Ground-dwelling
   spiders were sampled in the summer season from 180 pit-fall traps in
   five study sites that varied from either being burnt annually and grazed
   heavily, burnt biennially and conservatively grazed, to communal land
   with no set management practice. Variations between sites were assessed
   and based on spider species composition and assemblage structure.
   3. A total of 1145 individuals were collected representing 86 species
   from 60 genera and 43 families. Our results show that a majority of
   genera in these grasslands were represented by very few individuals,
   where a total of 37 species were represented by singletons and 17
   species that were doubletons. The most abundant families were the
   Lycosidae (64.3\%), Gnaphosidae (9.0\%), Zodariidae (5.3\%), Linyphiidae
   (4.7\%) and Salticidae (3.1\%).
   4. Grazing intensity and fire frequency had no measurable effect on
   ground-dwelling spider abundance diversity or assemblage structure. Only
   when rare or single species occurrence was included, was there some form
   of association with sites. This study has provided for the first
   preliminary inventory of ground-dwelling spiders for this habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Questions Functional redundancy in assemblages may insure ecosystem
   processes after perturbation, potentially causing temporary or permanent
   local species extinctions. Yet, functional redundancy has only been
   inferred by indirect evidence or measured by methods that may not be the
   most appropriate. Here, we apply an existing method to measure
   functional redundancy, which is the fraction of species diversity not
   expressed by functional diversity, to assess whether functional
   redundancy affects community resilience after disturbance.
   Location Subtropical grassland, south Brazil (30 degrees 0546S, 51
   degrees 4037W).
   Method: Species traits and community composition were assessed in
   quadrats before grazing and after community recovery. Grazing intensity
   (G) was measured in each quadrat. We used traits linked to grazing
   intensity to define functional redundancy (FR) as the difference of
   Gini-Simpson index of species diversity (D) and Rao's quadratic entropy
   (Q). Also, with the same traits, we defined community functional
   stability (S) as the similarity between trait-based community
   composition before grazing and 47 and 180 d after grazing ending. Using
   path analysis we assessed different postulated causal models linking
   functional diversity (Q), functional redundancy (FR), grazing intensity
   (G) and community-weightedmean traits to community stability (S) under
   grazing.
   Results: Path analysis revealed the most valid causal model FR -> S <-
   G, with a significant positive path coefficient for FR -> S and a
   marginally significant negative one for S <- G. Since FR and G were
   independent in their covariation and in their effects on S, the model
   discriminated community resistance to grazing (the effect of G on S)
   from community resilience after grazing caused by functional redundancy
   (indicated by the effect of FR on S).
   Conclusion: We show that expressing functional redundancymathematically
   is a useful tool for testing causal models linking diversity to
   community stability. The results support the conclusion that functional
   redundancy enhanced community resilience, therefore corroborating the
   insurance hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{This study looked at the medium term (5 years) dynamics of a sown,
   designed community of uncompetitive rosette forbs in wet, seasonally
   anaerobic soils. Twenty-one species of wet grassland habitats (15
   non-native and 6 native) were sown in 2004 in a split plot experiment,
   and then subjected to management treatments (cutting and irrigation) to
   test the response of individual species and the community as a whole.
   Density of sown plants declined across the experiment due to
   self-thinning, but this decline was not uniform, and resulted in three
   response groups, persisters, decliners and intermediates. These patterns
   of decline were not related to whether the species were native or
   non-native but rather reflected the fitness of individual species in
   relation to the specific conditions prevailing in the experiment. Three
   of the five persistent species were non-native. Neither irrigation nor
   cutting time (September or November) affected persistence. The main
   effect of the management treatments was to increase (in the case of
   irrigation plus November cut treatments) overall standing sown biomass
   and the biomass of individual plants. These larger plants flowered more
   effectively and produced more seeds. Contrary to our initial
   assumptions, despite the moderately productive soil, communities of
   rosette forbs were very slow to invade with taller, leafier stem
   species. The ratio of invading graminoid biomass to sown species biomass
   was lowest on the irrigated, November cut treatments, suggesting that
   longer term persistence of many species is likely to be maximised on
   wetter soils when cut later in the year. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The use of domestic animal grazing to manage temperate salt-marsh
   ecosystems is still debated and requires further field investigations.
   The effects of sheep grazing on plant community were studied in the
   salt-marshes of the Bay of Somme (France). We compared vegetation
   characteristics between two sets of grazed and ungrazed Im(2)-plots. We
   tested for differences in species composition using pair-wise
   Multi-Response Permutation Procedures (MRPP), used an Indicator Species
   Analysis (ISA) to distinguish species indicator of grazed and ungrazed
   areas and described community structures with species rank-abundance
   curves. Differences in species richness and plant height and biovolume
   were tested using Mann-Whitney tests. MRPP showed that plant community
   composition differed significantly between grazed plots, dominated by
   Puccinellia maritima and Festuca rubra ssp. litoralis, and ungrand
   plots, dominated by Halimione portulacoides (T = -60.37; A = 0.10; p <
   0.0001). Nine species were indicator of grazed areas and four of
   ungrazed areas. Grazed communities had higher species richness (3.5 +/-
   0.2 species.m(-2)) than ungrazed communities (2.9 +/- 0.1 species.m(-2);
   p <0.001). This significant difference is noteworthy in salt-marsh
   systems usually characterized by low contrasts of species richness. In
   grazed plots, vegetation height and biovolume were lower but vegetation
   cover was higher than in ungrazed plots, According to the identity of
   the species, plants lost 16.7\% to 86.3\% of their height under grazing
   pressure. The species showing the highest decrease in height (> 50\%)
   were mainly pioneer halophytes and grasses. Aster tripolium, Suaeda
   maritima var. marllima, Halimione portulacoides, Spergularia marina were
   heavily damaged or browsed and lost more than 90\% of their biovolume in
   grazed area. Through cascading effects, sheep grazing reduces the
   vegetation height, controls the identity of dominant species, relaxes
   competitive interaction for light between species and, finally,
   positively influences plant species richness. We thus recommend a
   moderate and extensive sheep grazing to manage European salt-marshes
   dominated by few highly competitive plant species. Finally, we
   categorized species according to their height loss percentage under
   grazing and their indicator value from ISA to provide a field tool to
   help the shepherds to estimate the impact of grazing on salt-marsh
   plants.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Ecosystem functions and underlying services are strongly
   influenced by multitrophic relationships, with functional traits playing
   a central role in structuring them. Which traits and functional metrics
   mediate the impact of different types of land use on ecosystem function
   within and across trophic levels? \textbackslash{}
   Methods: We studied the functional relationships between plants and
   grasshoppers in sub-alpine grasslands under different management regimes
   in the Central French Alps. We applied the theoretical multitrophic
   response-effect framework described by (Journal of Vegetation Science,
   24, this issue) to identify key traits linking plants and grasshoppers
   to biomass production. The linkages between selected plant and
   grasshopper traits were analysed using community-weighted mean traits
   (CWM) and functional diversity (FD; Rao's quadratic diversity).
   Results: Uni-and multivariate models provided evidence about the
   relative importance of trait linkages within and across trophic levels.
   We showed that management affected both plant and grasshopper traits and
   that the interaction between themwas linked to biomass production. While
   a number ofCWMtraits and FD were involved in the interaction, CWM of
   leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and grasshopper dry bodymass (GMass)
   chieflymediated the impact of management change on biomass production.
   Conclusions: Our study suggests that both trait values of the most
   abundant species and functional trait variation within and across
   trophic levels in combination may best explain the impact of land-use
   changes on ecosystem function. To improve ourmechanistic understanding
   across trophic levels, a better knowledge of response and effect traits
   remains a major goal, especially for animal ecologists, while a strong
   collaboration among disciplines is needed to bridge the existing gaps.}},

Abstract = {{Although the process of reforestation of grassland has been widely
   studied in Europe, little is known about the effect of deforestation on
   grassland development. Thus, the specific objective of this study was to
   evaluate early changes in plant species composition, functional group,
   yield and biomass quality after deforestation of long-term abandoned
   pastures. The experiment was established immediately after deforestation
   on sparse herbaceous vegetation (mean initial cover 27\%) with the
   following treatments: grazing management only (G0), cutting and grazing
   aftermath (CG), grazing after seeding of grassland mixture (GS), grazing
   after a burning treatment in which branches were burned after
   deforestation (GB) and unmanaged control (U). Very rapid recovery of
   bare ground by germination and/or sprouting of grassland species was
   similar under all types of grazing management. Total plant species
   richness increased in all managed treatments except GB. Similarities
   according to redundancy analyses in plant species composition were found
   among G0, CG and GB treatments, especially for forbs with correlated
   rosette or creeping growth. The woody species, tall grasses and tall
   forbs had higher abundance in the U treatment. The restoration of
   grassland following deforestation of formerly reforested grassland area
   by grazing management was a relatively fast process, and swards were
   created after 3years. The highest biomass yield was observed under
   treatments GS and GB. Forage quality of all managed treatments was
   sufficient for the demands of beef cattle grazing. However, for
   subsequent grassland preservation, some type of grazing management is
   necessary to prevent reforestation, which can occur immediately after
   deforestation in unmanaged places.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, the use of some subalpine mountain grasslands in the
   Central Spanish Pyrenees has changed. Ski resorts have been developed
   and cattle herd management has shifted from the traditional
   ``rotational-type{''} system in which grazing cattle are overseen by a
   herder to a ``continuous-type{''} system that does not involve a herder.
   In 2005, the locations of 30 floristic inventories performed in 1972
   were revisited and inventories were repeated in two adjacent similar
   areas, although one had been used for the development of ski runs and
   the other had not. The objective was to assess the effects of those
   changes on plant diversity and other characteristics of the grasslands.
   In both areas, plant diversity was significantly higher in 2005 than it
   was in 1972. Both areas had been grazed by cattle to a similar extent;
   thus, the results suggest that diversity was affected primarily by the
   change in the livestock grazing system. Livestock grazing within the
   skiing area appears to have counterbalanced any reduction in plant
   diversity that would have occurred because of the construction and use
   of ski runs. In the skiing area, legume cover and pastoral value
   decreased, the Ellenberg Nitrogen Index reflected lower soil nutrients
   available to plants, and the cover of plant species that regenerate by
   seeds increased between 1972 and 2005; such changes did not occur in the
   non-skiing area. The abundance of ruderal species increased more in the
   skiing area than in the non-skiing area. Between 1981 and 2000, the
   amount of bare ground increased only in the skiing area.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological damage caused by unadjusted and raised stocking rates are
   persistent problems in grazed mountain areas in developing countries,
   including in post-Soviet Asia. An assessment of this degradation is
   difficult due to site heterogeneity and insufficient knowledge about the
   grazing systems. We present an integrated appraisal of the potential
   stocking rates of sites based on physical site properties. We combine
   these ecological and agrarian analyses with the economic calculation of
   opportunity costs in scenarios. We apply this approach to a high
   mountain region in the eastern Greater Caucasus in Azerbaijan, which
   provides valuable ecosystem services and is heavily used as summer
   pasture by mobile pastoralists. Hence, an impact assessment of reducing
   the legal prescriptions of stocking rates or the calculation of payments
   for ecosystem services is possible. Our results show that stocking rates
   on many pastures are spatially unadjusted and destocking measures need
   to be implemented in order to preserve ecosystem services. We also
   discuss different distribution possibilities of the opportunity costs.}},

Abstract = {{Dry grasslands represent unique ecosystems that are known for high
   biodiversity. Land use changes have led to a decline in Europe. Shrub
   encroachment is a major problem in incorrectly or unmanaged areas, and
   affects not only flora and fauna but also leads to changes in the
   appearance of the landscape. Our study was conducted on the island of
   Hiddensee, north-east Germany, where today dry grasslands are endangered
   by shrub encroachment. We analysed the current land use under
   consideration of farming costs as well as current agricultural
   subsidies. Our results show that revenues of low-intensity cattle
   husbandry only account for 61\% of total costs and that farming becomes
   profitable only with subsidies. Our study illustrates that goats can be
   a cost-efficient solution for areas with high shrub cover in contrast to
   manual clearing. The maintenance of dry grasslands is therefore more
   cost-efficient with grazing animals than with technical-manual labour.}},

Abstract = {{Climatic warming is substantially intensifying the global water cycle(1)
   and is projected to increase rainfall variability(2). Using satellite
   data, we show that higher climatic variability is associated with
   reduced tree cover in the wet tropics globally. In contrast, interannual
   variability in rainfall can have neutral or even positive effects on
   tree cover in the dry tropics. In South America, tree cover in dry lands
   is higher in areas with high year-to-year variability in rainfall. This
   is consistent with evidence from case studies suggesting that in these
   areas rare wet episodes are essential for opening windows of opportunity
   where massive tree recruitment can overwhelm disturbance effects,
   allowing the establishment of extensive woodlands. In Australia, wet
   extremes have similar effects, but the net effect of rainfall
   variability is overwhelmed by negative effects of extreme dry years. In
   Africa, effects of rainfall variability are neutral for dry lands. It is
   most likely that differences in herbivore communities and fire regimes
   contribute to regulating tree expansion during wet extremes. Our results
   illustrate that increasing climatic variability may affect ecosystem
   services in contrasting, and sometimes surprising, ways. Expansion of
   dry tropical tree cover during extreme wet events may decrease grassland
   productivity but enhance carbon sequestration, soil nutrient retention
   and biodiversity(3).}},

Title = {{Grazed vegetation mosaics do not maximize arthropod diversity: Evidence
   from salt marshes}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{164}},
Pages = {{150-157}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Light to moderate grazing in grasslands can create vegetation mosaics of
   short grazed vegetation and tall ungrazed vegetation. These mosaics have
   been proposed to maximize plant and animal species richness, yet
   experimental evidence, especially regarding arthropods is scarce. This
   study compares abundance, richness and species composition of arthropods
   in grazed mosaics to those of homogeneous short and tall vegetation.
   We sampled arthropods on three German coastal salt marshes where grazing
   with three densities (high, moderate and none) was installed in 1989 on
   previously intensively grazed plots. Stable vegetation mosaics had
   developed under moderate stocking densities. We collected spiders,
   beetles, bugs and moth larvae by suction sampling in a stratified random
   sampling design.
   Treatments had caused large differences in plant composition after 20
   years, which were reflected in the arthropod community. Most species
   showed a clear preference for either short or tall vegetation, but some
   species were most abundant in grazed mosaics. Arthropod richness and
   composition were similar in patches of short vegetation in moderately
   and highly stocked plots, while patches of tall vegetation were similar
   to ungrazed plots. Surprisingly, however, grazed mosaics were not richer
   in species than homogeneous tall vegetation, despite the co-occurrence
   of species from short, tall and mosaic vegetation.
   We conclude that, although arthropod richness of salt marshes is greatly
   enhanced when stocking density is decreased, this cannot substitute
   ungrazed marshes for conservation of arthropod diversity. However, long
   term cessation leads to the disappearance of several species, and
   therefore the possibilities of rotational grazing should be explored.

Abstract = {{Despite the selective pressure slugs may exert on seedling recruitment
   there is a lack of information in this context within grassland
   restoration studies. Selective grazing is influenced by interspecific
   differences in acceptability. As part of a larger study of how
   slugseedling interactions may influence upland hay meadow restoration,
   an assessment of relative acceptability is made for seedlings of meadow
   plants to the slug, Deroceras reticulatum.
   Slug feeding damage to seedling monocultures of 23 meadow species and
   Brassica napus was assessed in microcosms over 14 d. The severity and
   rate of damage incurred by each plant species was analysed with a
   generalized additive mixed model. Plant species were then ranked for
   their relative acceptability.
   Interspecific variation in relative acceptability suggested seedlings of
   meadow species form a hierarchy of acceptability to D. reticulatum. The
   four most acceptable species were Achillea millefolium and the grasses
   Holcus lanatus, Poa trivialis and Festuca rubra. Trifolium pratense was
   acceptable to D. reticulatum and was the second highest ranking forb
   species. The most unacceptable species were mainly forbs associated with
   the target grassland, and included Geranium sylvaticum, Rumex acetosa,
   Leontodon hispidus and the grass Anthoxanthum odoratum. A strong
   positive correlation was found for mean cumulative feeding damage and
   cumulative seedling mortality at day 14.
   Highly unacceptable species to D. reticulatum are unlikely to be
   selectively grazed by slugs during the seedling recruitment phase, and
   were predominantly target restoration species. Seedlings of highly
   acceptable species may be less likely to survive slug herbivory and
   contribute to seedling recruitment at restoration sites. Selective slug
   herbivory, influenced by acceptability, may influence community-level
   processes if seedling recruitment and establishment of key functional
   species, such as T. pratense is reduced.}},

Abstract = {{In many ecosystems ungulates have coexisted with grasslands over long
   periods of time. However, high densities of grazing animals may change
   the floristic and structural characteristics of vegetation, reduce
   biodiversity, and increase soil erosion, potentially triggering abrupt
   and rapid changes in ecosystem condition. Alternate stable state theory
   provides a framework for understanding this type of dynamic. In the
   Sanjiangyuan atop the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau (QTP), grassland
   degradation has been accompanied by irruptions of native burrowing
   animals, which has accentuated the loss of ground cover. Severely
   degraded areas of alpine meadows are referred to as `Heitutan'. Here,
   using the framework of alternate stable state theory, we describe the
   proximate and ultimate drivers of the formation of Heitutan on the QTP,
   and we assess prospects for recovery, in relation to the degree of
   biophysical alteration, of these alpine meadows. Effective
   rehabilitation measures must address the underlying causes of
   degradation rather than their symptoms. Heitutan degradation is not
   uni-causal. Rather it reflects different mechanisms operating at
   different spatio-temporal scales across this vast region. Underlying
   causes include overly aggressive exploitation of the grasslands (e.g.
   overgrazing), amplification of grazing and erosion damage by small
   mammals when outbreaks occur, and/or climate change. Given marked
   variability in environmental conditions and stressors, restorative
   efforts must vary across the region. Restoration efforts are likely to
   yield greatest success if moderately and severely degraded areas are
   targeted as the first priority in management programmes, before these
   areas are transformed into extreme Heitutan.}},

Abstract = {{Tallgrass prairies of central North America have experienced
   disturbances including fire and grazing for millennia. Little is known
   about the effects of these disturbances on prairie ants, even though
   ants are thought to play major roles in ecosystem maintenance. We
   implemented three management treatments on remnant and restored
   grassland tracts in the central U.S., and compared the effects of
   treatment on abundance of ant functional groups. Management treatments
   were: (1) patch-burn graze-rotational burning of three spatially
   distinct patches within a fenced tract, and growing-season cattle
   grazing; (2) graze-and-burn-burning entire tract every 3 years, and
   growing-season cattle grazing, and (3) burn-only-burning entire tract
   every 3 years, but no cattle grazing. Ant species were classified into
   one of four functional groups. Opportunist ants and the dominant ant
   species, Formica montana, were more abundant in burn-only tracts than
   tracts managed with either of the grazing treatments. Generalists were
   more abundant in graze-and-burn tracts than in burn-only tracts.
   Abundance of F. montana was negatively associated with pre-treatment
   time since fire, whereas generalist ant abundance was positively
   associated. F. montana were more abundant in restored tracts than
   remnants, whereas the opposite was true for subdominants and
   opportunists. In summary, abundance of the dominant F. montana increased
   in response to intense disturbances that were followed by quick recovery
   of plant biomass. Generalist ant abundance decreased in response to
   those disturbances, which we attribute to the effects of competitive
   dominance of F. montana upon the generalists.}},

Title = {{Resource use in two contrasting habitat types raises different
   challenges for the conservation of the dryad butterfly Minois dryas}},

Abstract = {{The suitability of any location for a given species is determined by the
   available resources. However, there are many species that occur in more
   than one habitat type and their successful conservation may be
   particularly difficult. The dryad Minois dryas, a locally endangered
   butterfly, occurs in two contrasting habitats-xerothemic and wet
   grasslands. We investigated the influence of various habitat
   characteristics, such as vegetation height, grass cover, proximity of
   shrubs, plant species composition, Ellenberg indices of trophic and
   microclimatic conditions, on the microhabitat selection by the species.
   The nectaring of randomly selected butterflies was observed and habitat
   characteristics were compared at random points within the meadow and at
   the butterfly's nectaring and resting places. The butterflies generally
   preferred to stay close to shrubs and avoided invasive goldenrods.
   Thermal conditions and the availability of nectar plants were the
   factors limiting the dryad's use of wet grassland. In xerothermic
   habitats grass cover affected the distribution of butterflies.
   Concerning the availability of larval host plants, wet meadows proved
   potentially more favourable, whereas nectar resources for adults were
   more abundant in xerothermic grasslands. Based on our findings,
   conservation strategies for this butterfly must differ in the two
   habitats. Rotational mowing in xerothermic grasslands and the removal of
   invasive goldenrods in wet grasslands are the recommended actions. At a
   larger spatial scale, a habitat mosaic composed of xerothermic and wet
   grasslands in close proximity would seem to be the most suitable areas
   for the conservation of the dryad.}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale soil heterogeneity relates to productivity and biodiversity
   and is crucial to understand. Soil heterogeneity could be affected by
   vegetation structure, and large mammal grazers could modify it through
   herbivory and excretion. The objective is to clarify the effects of
   livestock grazing on the small-scale (similar to 3 m) soil heterogeneity
   in three types of Mongolian grasslands.
   We sampled soils from inside (ungrazed) and outside (grazed) exclosures
   in three vegetation types: forest-steppe, shrub-steppe, and
   desert-steppe. We measured laboratory rates of soil net nitrogen (N)
   mineralization and net nitrification and geostatistically analyzed
   heterogeneity.
   Average rates of net N mineralization and net nitrification were lower
   at shrub-steppe and desert-steppe and were decreased by grazing.
   Semivariograms showed vegetation-induced heterogeneity in ungrazed
   plots, except for net nitrification at forest-steppe. We found linear
   change with distance under dense and uniform vegetation at
   forest-steppe, 1.3 m patch under patchy vegetation at shrub-steppe, and
   linear change, but with much smaller semivariance, under sparse and poor
   vegetation at desert-steppe. At forest-steppe, grazing randomized the
   spatial patterns of net N mineralization and net nitrification. At
   shrub-steppe and desert-steppe, grazing greatly decreased the
   semivariances of net N mineralization and net nitrification as well as
   their averages, and the soil heterogeneity was virtually disappeared.
   Grazing in Mongolian grasslands homogenized the spatial patterns of net
   N mineralization and net nitrification, irrespective of their original
   spatial patterns determined by the differences in vegetation structure.}},

Abstract = {{Foraging behaviour (grazing time, diet selection) and overlap in
   vegetation use between five beef cows, five mares, 32 ewes and 32 does,
   suckling their offspring born in late winter-early spring, was compared
   across the grazing season (May-December). Animals were managed in mixed
   grazing on heather-gorse vegetation communities with an adjacent area
   (24\%) of ryegrass-clover improved pasture. Equines spent more daily
   time grazing than the other species in all seasons, averaging 610
   min/day compared to 530, 481 and 496 min/day spent by cattle, sheep and
   goats, respectively. Seasonal changes in both grazing behaviour and diet
   selection were observed. Generally, cows, mares and ewes spent most of
   their grazing time on the improved pasture (0.77, 0.73 and 0.59,
   respectively), whereas goats spent more time grazing on shrublands
   (0.70). All species concentrated their diurnal grazing activity in the
   morning and late afternoon, whilst resting occurred mainly in the middle
   of the day. Herbaceous species were the main component in the diets of
   cattle, equines and sheep across the whole grazing season, whereas for
   goats this predominance was only observed during the spring. Cattle,
   sheep and equines turned to browse only when pasture availability
   decreased. Cattle and sheep tended to select heather in moderate amounts
   whereas they avoided gorse across the grazing season. By contrast,
   horses seemed to be able to deal with the gorse spiny shoots and
   consumed it in the autumn (averaging 0.29). The goats' diet at the end
   of the grazing season was mainly composed of heather species, reaching
   0.81 in November. Degree of grazing overlap between livestock species
   was influenced by the animal species and also varied across the grazing
   season. The greatest similarity indexes (KSI) based on grazing time and
   diet composition data were found between cattle and equines (0.86) and
   between cattle and sheep (0.94), whereas the combination of goats with
   the other animal species resulted in lower KSI values. Dietary overlap
   decreased as the improved pasture availability decreased during the
   grazing season. Results suggest that the success of management
   strategies (type and composition of the flock, mixed or sequential,
   continuous or seasonal) in these heterogeneous vegetation conditions
   will depend on plant species characteristics and its proportions.
   Grazing management options should be based on production (animal
   performance) or environmental goals (biodiversity, control of shrub
   encroachment, reduction of fire risk, etc.) previously defined. Goats
   proved to be the best complement to the other animal species for an
   efficient use of natural vegetation. Nevertheless, studies should be
   carried out to assess the interactions between grazing behaviour and
   animal performance in these particular vegetation conditions. (C) 2013

Volume = {{175}},

Abstract = {{Temperate grasses are infected with endophytic fungi of the genus
   Neotyphodium. These fungi asymptomatically live inside the plant's
   tissue enhancing resistance of their hosts to herbivores and abiotic
   stresses. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), infected with
   Neotyphodium lolii can be detrimental to grazing livestock causing a
   neural disease. This study aimed at determining the impact of grassland
   management on fungal incidence. In a rural district of Central Germany
   90 sites differing in land use intensity (extensive, intermediate and
   intensive) and grassland use (pastures, mown pastures, and meadows) were
   investigated for the presence of N. loliL Infections were detected in
   41\% of the sites sampled, but overall infection rates were low (5.8 +/-
   9.2\%). Neither the intensity of land use nor the type of grassland
   influenced endophytic incidences. In contrast, the geology of the
   sampled sites had a significant impact on the incidence of N. lolii.
   Grass tillers collected from limestone sites showed significantly higher
   infection rates than from other soils. We hypothesize that the low field
   capacity and high amount of potassium on limestone sites favored the
   survival of infected grasses under drought stress. Therefore, geology
   should be taken into account when considering management strategies for
   this endophytic fungus. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{As drivers of terrestrial ecosystems, humans have replaced large
   carnivores in most areas, and human influence not only exerts striking
   ecological pressures on biodiversity at local scales but also has
   indirect effects in distant corners of the world. We suggest that the
   multibillion dollar cashmere industry creates economic motivations that
   link western fashion preferences for cashmere to land use in Central
   Asia. This penchant for stylish clothing, in turn, encourages herders to
   increase livestock production which affects persistence of over 6
   endangered large mammals in these remote, arid ecosystems. We
   hypothesized that global trade in cashmere has strong negative effects
   on native large mammals of deserts and grassland where
   cashmere-producing goats are raised. We used time series data,
   ecological snapshots of the biomass of native and domestic ungulates,
   and ecologically and behaviorally based fieldwork to test our
   hypothesis. In Mongolia increases in domestic goat production were
   associated with a 3-fold increase in local profits for herders
   coexisting with endangered saiga(Saiga tatarica).That increasing
   domestic grazing pressure carries fitness consequences was inferred on
   the basis of an approximately 4-fold difference in juvenile recruitment
   among blue sheep(Pseudois nayaur)in trans-Himalayan India. Across 7
   study areas in Mongolia, India, and China's Tibetan Plateau, native
   ungulate biomass is now<5\% that of domestic species. Such trends
   suggest ecosystem degradation and decreased capacity for the persistence
   of native species, including at least 8 Asian endemic species: saiga,
   chiru(Pantholops hodgsoni), Bactrian camel(Camelus bactrianus), snow
   leopard(Panthera uncia), khulan(Equus hemionus), kiang(E. kiang),
   takhi(E. przewalski), and wild yak(Bos mutus). Our results suggest
   striking yet indirect and unintended actions that link trophic-level
   effects to markets induced by the trade for cashmere.}},

Abstract = {{Information on soil seed bank processes is crucial for understanding
   vegetation dynamics. Despite the documented importance of soil seed
   banks in many ecosystems, their role is not fully understood in some
   sensitive habitats, such as the alpine meadows of the Tibetan Plateau.
   We studied the seasonal dynamics of the germinable soil seed bank under
   four disturbance intensities in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau
   as well as seed size distribution relative to disturbance intensity.
   Composition of the seed bank was compared with that of the standing
   vegetation.
   Density of buried seeds increased with disturbance intensity, but
   species richness and species diversity decreased. Seed density and
   species richness of the seed bank varied seasonally in all layers (0-2,
   2-7, 7-12 cm) and the whole (0-12 cm). The species composition of seed
   bank was not significantly influenced by season. There was no trend in
   seed size distribution as disturbance increased. Seasonal seed bank
   turnover rates increased with increase in disturbance. The result of the
   NMDS showed that species composition of seed bank and vegetation
   exhibited a fairly uniform pattern in each season.
   Although as a whole the species composition of the vegetation and seed
   bank showed a relatively low degree of similarity in each season,
   similarity was highest in the most disturbed habitat. There was no
   alteration in species composition of seed bank regardless of disturbance
   intensity, but seed density decreased as disturbance increased.
   Disturbances in alpine plant communities might increase persistence of
   regeneration niches. Regeneration from the seed bank together with
   vegetative reproduction contributed to aboveground vegetation in highly
   disturbed habitats. Clonal species played an important role in
   regeneration of vegetation in slightly disturbed areas, where there was
   little contribution of ruderals from soil seed banks.}},

Title = {{Grazing dampens the positive effects of shrub encroachment on ecosystem
   functions in a semi-arid woodland}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1028-1038}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. The encroachment of woody plants into grasslands, open woodlands and
   savannah has been widely reported over the past few decades. Overgrazing
   is a probable cause of shrub encroachment and could be a stronger driver
   of declining ecosystem structure and functioning in shrublands than
   encroachment per se. We examined the relative effects of changes in
   shrub cover and grazing rate on ecosystem functions at sandy and loamy
   sites in eastern Australia varying in shrub cover and grazing. Our aim
   was to test the notion that the negative effects on ecosystem
   functioning commonly attributed to encroachment are more likely due to
   grazing than to increase in shrub cover per se. 2. Structural equation
   modelling indicated a generally strong positive effect of increasing
   shrub cover, and a generally negative, or slight effect of grazing on
   multiple measures of ecosystem function related to plant productivity,
   water infiltration, nutrient cycling and surface stability. 3. On loamy
   soils, grazing generally dampened the positive effects of increasing
   shrub cover on most response variables. On sandy soils, however,
   although there were generally stronger effects of grazing, most
   attributes did not change in response to increasing shrub cover. 4.
   Synthesis and applications. Our results indicate that, contrary to the
   prevailing opinion, increasing shrub cover was generally associated with
   increases (or no change) in functional and structural measures
   indicative of healthy systems. The dampening of the positive effects of
   shrub cover caused by grazing was site (soil texture) specific,
   reinforcing the notion that the effects of increasing shrub cover and
   their interaction with grazing are context dependent. Our study provides
   the basis for improved understanding and management of shrublands for a
   number of competing goals and suggests that managing grazing rates is a
   better strategy than focusing on shrub removal. Using low levels of
   grazing is likely to maximize the benefits from shrublands, such as the
   maintenance of biodiversity, water infiltration and C sequestration,
   while maintaining a productive herbaceous community.}},

Abstract = {{Fire and grazing significantly impact small-scale patch structure and
   dynamics in savanna grasslands. We assessed small-scale grass-forb
   associations in long-term fire and grazing experiments in North America
   (NA) and Southern Africa (SA). Transects of 128 0.25 m(2) contiguous
   quadrats were sampled in areas with different combinations of grazing
   (ungrazed, single grazer, or multiple grazers) and fire frequency
   (unburned or annually burned). We predicted that (1) the patch structure
   of each of the dominant grasses in NA and SA would respond similarly to
   fire and grazing, and (2) that forb richness would be correlated to
   grass patch structure. Semi-variance analysis was used to determine
   patch structure of dominant grasses and forb cover. Community structure
   responded similarly in NA and SA to fire, grazing, and fire-grazing
   interactions. Species richness, diversity, and community heterogeneity
   were significantly higher in unburned-grazed sites. Grazing
   significantly increased forb cover and decreased cover of the dominant
   grasses, and the effects of fire on community structure depended on the
   grazing regime. Contrary to our prediction, we found that small-scale
   patch structure of the dominant grass species in NA and SA responded
   differently to grazing and fire. We found strong grass patch structure
   in unburned-ungrazed grasslands in both sites; however, grazing and fire
   reduced patch structure in NA but not SA, and in no instance did grass
   patch structure influence forb community structure. We conclude that
   fire and grazing have larger impacts on small-scale patch structure in
   NA than they do in SA even though overall community structure responded
   similarly on both continents.}},

Title = {{Effect of reindeer grazing on snowmelt, albedo and energy balance based
   on satellite data analyses}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Pages = {{107-117}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Surface albedo has a major influence on the energy balance of the Earth.
   The albedo difference between snow-covered and snow-free tundra is high.
   Earlier studies have shown that taller and denser vegetation causes
   earlier snowmelt, and that shrub height and abundance, as well as the
   total biomass in summer reindeer pastures are lower than in winter
   pastures. Therefore, reindeer summer grazing could eventually delay the
   snowmelt and decrease the absorbed solar energy on the ground. The
   effect of reindeer summer grazing on the vegetation, snowmelt timing,
   surface albedo and ground heating is investigated in this study by
   comparing summer and non-summer pastures in the northern tundra areas of
   Fennoscandia. A comparison of vegetation types, NDVI, fractional snow
   cover and albedo between the Finnish year-round (including summer)
   pastures and the Norwegian non-summer (winter or spring/autumn) pastures
   is performed. Other factors influencing the snowmelt, such as surface
   air temperature, ground elevation and incoming solar radiation are taken
   into account. Information about the vegetation on the ground is based on
   a vegetation map compiled from Landsat TM/ETM + satellite data and
   ancillary map information. The NDVI, snowmelt and albedo analyses are
   performed using multi-temporal remote sensing data such as GlobSnow SE
   and MODIS based NDVI, snow and albedo products. The results here support
   previous studies and indicate that vegetation in the summer pastures is
   shorter and sparser and that snowmelt there occurs later than in the
   more densely vegetated, non-summer pastures. More shrubs protruding
   above the snowpack and earlier snowmelt on the Norwegian side lower the
   albedo during the snowmelt season. This causes higher solar energy
   absorption of up to 6 W/m(2) in the snowmelt season and contributes up
   to 0.5 W/m(2) to the yearly energy balance. Therefore this study
   suggests that summer reindeer herding can be used to delay snowmelt,
   increase surface albedo and to decrease the ground heating in the
   snowmelt season. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation policy often incentivizes managers of human-impacted areas
   to create landscape heterogeneity to maximize biodiversity. In
   rangeland, patchy disturbance regimes create landscape heterogeneity
   (patch contrast), but outcomes of heterogeneity-based management are
   rarely tested for a universal response. We analyzed four habitat
   variables - vegetation structure, plant functional group composition,
   litter cover, and bare ground - from five experimental rangelands in
   Oklahoma and Iowa, USA. We tested for response consistency to
   heterogeneity-based management across and within locations. We
   calculated effect sizes for each variable to compare patch contrast on
   pastures managed for heterogeneity (patch burn-grazing) and pastures
   managed for homogeneity (grazing with homogeneous fire regimes). Effects
   varied considerably across and within locations. Effects of
   heterogeneity-based management were positive for all variables at only
   three of five experimental rangeland locations. No location showed a
   consistent pattern of positive effect across all four variables,
   although one location showed no effect for any variable. At another
   location, we found a positive effect of heterogeneity-based management
   on litter cover and bare ground, but no effect on vegetation structure
   and plant functional group composition. We discuss effect variability
   and how the fire-grazing interaction applies to rangeland management and
   conservation. Although it is accepted practice to use
   heterogeneity-based management to increase rangeland habitat diversity,
   managers should also confirm that evaluation metrics match desired
   conservation outcomes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Plant Trait Assembly Affects Superiority of Grazer's Foraging Strategies
   in Species-Rich Grasslands}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{Background: Current plant - herbivore interaction models and experiments
   with mammalian herbivores grazing plant monocultures show the
   superiority of a maximizing forage quality strategy (MFQ) over a
   maximizing intake strategy (MI). However, there is a lack of evidence
   whether grazers comply with the model predictions under field
   conditions.
   Methodology/Findings: We assessed diet selection of sheep (Ovis aries)
   using plant functional traits in productive mesic vs. low-productivity
   dry species-rich grasslands dominated by resource-exploitative vs.
   resource-conservative species respectively. Each grassland type was
   studied in two replicates for two years. We investigated the first
   grazing cycle in a set of 288 plots with a diameter of 30 cm, i.e. the
   size of sheep feeding station. In mesic grasslands, high plot
   defoliation was associated with community weighted means of leaf traits
   referring to high forage quality, i.e. low leaf dry matter content
   (LDMC) and high specific leaf area (SLA), with a high proportion of
   legumes and the most with high community weighted mean of forage
   indicator value. In contrast in dry grasslands, high community weighted
   mean of canopy height, an estimate of forage quantity, was the best
   predictor of plot defoliation. Similar differences in selection on
   forage quality vs. quantity were detected within plots. Sheep selected
   plants with higher forage indicator values than the plot specific
   community weighted mean of forage indicator value in mesic grasslands
   whereas taller plants were selected in dry grasslands. However, at this
   scale sheep avoided legumes and plants with higher SLA, preferred plants
   with higher LDMC while grazing plants with higher forage indicator
   values in mesic grasslands.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate that MFQ appears superior over MI
   only in habitats with a predominance of resource-exploitative species.
   Furthermore, plant functional traits (LDMC, SLA, nitrogen fixer) seem to
   be helpful correlates of forage quality only at the community level.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how the management practices of silvopastoral systems
   affect the long-term sustainability of oak ecosystems and what their
   influence is on nutrient cycling and plant community, is of great
   interest. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of relative
   grazing intensity on soil properties and on vegetation characteristics
   in an open canopy oak forest dominated by Quercus frainetto. The
   research was conducted in the area of Pentalofos, which is located in
   Evros region, north-eastern Greece and is grazed by goats. The distance
   from a goat corral was used to represent relative grazing intensity. In
   June 2011, soil and vegetation samples were collected along transects
   placed at 50, 150, 300, 600 and 1200 m from the goat corral, running
   perpendicular to three replicates. Soil measurements included pH,
   phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) concentrations while vegetation
   measurements included plant cover, species composition and diversity.
   Plant cover was not significantly different among grazing intensities.
   Species diversity, especially of the woody vegetation layer, was
   significantly higher in the light grazing intensity in comparison to
   both the heavy and the very light grazing. Heavy grazing reduced soil
   organic matter while it increased total nitrogen. Grazing intensity did
   not affect available P and soil pH. Light to moderate goat grazing could
   ameliorate floristic diversity and increase sustainability of oak
   forests in the Mediterranean region.}},

Abstract = {{Amphipod crustaceans are able to colonise different micro-habitats of
   coastal marine benthos due to a multiplicity of trophic and
   morpho-functional adaptations, and may be considered a key taxon in
   describing the structure of assemblages. Literature concerning amphipod
   feeding behaviour and way of life showed that studies on functional
   groups (FGs) started only in the 1980s. A short review about the state
   of the art of the knowledge is presented here. Aiming at investigating
   the functional role of amphipods and to ascertain to what extent their
   adaptations could be a response to different biotic and abiotic
   conditions, some examples of studies conducted in the Mediterranean Sea
   on various plant substrata (Posidonia oceanica, Cymodocea nodosa,
   Zostera marina, Caulerpa racemosa var. cylindracea), at different
   spatial and temporal scales, were given. Despite many doubts about some
   species, due to the lack of information and their opportunistic
   behaviour, the identified taxa were grouped in the main categories of
   suspension feeders, deposit feeders, carnivores, commensals, herbivores,
   plant detritus feeders, omnivores, and in the mixed categories of
   deposit-suspension feeders, deposit feeders-carnivores,
   herbivores-deposit feeders, according to the food ingested and their
   feeding strategies; and, according to their life-habits, in epifaunal
   free-living and domicolous, and infaunal free-burrowing and
   tube-building. FGs might be considered good descriptors of zonation
   patterns, mainly against gradients such as depth, where strong
   environmental factors play a role. FG composition was differentiated
   according to the structural complexity and the stability of the host
   plant. Changes observed on a long-term scale, due to regression
   phenomena in P. oceanica meadows or to the spread of the invasive
   species C. racemosa var. cylindracea, were well described by FGs. In the
   first case the trophic diversity was maintained and in the latter the
   lack of herbivorous forms pointed out the poor role as structuring plant
   of the seaweed. Although caution is suggested in studies on FGs, they
   can give further insight in comprehending structural and functional
   processes in amphipod ecology.}},

Abstract = {{Estimates of global primary bioenergy potentials in the literature span
   almost three orders of magnitude. We narrow that range by discussing
   biophysical constraints on bioenergy potentials resulting from plant
   growth (NPP) and its current human use. In the last 30 years,
   terrestrial NPP was almost constant near 54 PgC yr(-1), despite massive
   efforts to increase yields in agriculture and forestry. The global human
   appropriation of terrestrial plant production has doubled in the last
   century. We estimate the maximum physical potential of the world's total
   land area outside croplands, infrastructure, wilderness and denser
   forests to deliver bioenergy at approximately 190 EJ yr(-1). These
   pasture lands, sparser woodlands, savannas and tundras are already used
   heavily for grazing and store abundant carbon; they would have to be
   entirely converted to bioenergy and intensive forage production to
   provide that amount of energy. Such a high level of bioenergy supply
   would roughly double the global human biomass harvest, with far-reaching
   effects on biodiversity, ecosystems and food supply. Identifying
   sustainable levels of bioenergy and finding ways to integrate bioenergy
   with food supply and ecological conservation goals remains a huge and
   pressing scientific challenge.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of study: Plant functional traits are commonly used as proxies
   for plant responses to environmental challenges, yet few studies have
   explored how functional trait distributions differ across gradients of
   land-use change. By comparing trait distributions in intact forests with
   those across land-use change gradients, we can improve our understanding
   of the ways land-use change alters the diversity and functioning of
   plant communities.
   Methods: We examined how the variation and distribution of trait values
   for seven plant functional traits differ between reference natural
   forest and three types of land-use conversion (pasture, old-field, or
   ``legacy{''} sites-regrowth following logging), landscape productivity
   (NPP) and vegetation strata (tree or non-tree ``understory{''}), in a
   meta-analysis of studies from 15 landscapes across five continents.
   Key results: Although trait variation often differed between land-uses
   within a landscape, these patterns were rarely consistent across
   landscapes. The variance and distribution of traits were more likely to
   differ consistently between natural forest and land-use conversion
   categories for understory (non-tree) plants than for trees. Landscape
   productivity did not significantly alter the difference in trait
   variance between natural forest and land-use conversion categories for
   any trait except dispersal.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that even for traits well linked to
   plant environmental response strategies, broad classes of land-use
   change and landscape productivity are not generally useful indicators of
   the mechanisms driving compositional changes in human-modified forest
   systems.}},

Title = {{Reduced Sheep Grazing and Biodiversity: A Novel Approach to Selecting
   and Measuring Biodiversity Indicators}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{Traditional upland livestock grazing is declining worldwide, leading to
   concerns about possible impacts on biodiversity. Although monitoring of
   protected areas often focuses on rare species, management changes also
   affect currently common species and vegetation structure.
   ``Biodiversity{''} is a concept rather than a simple variable, and
   monitoring it requires indicators that are widely applicable and
   appropriate to context. This paper presents a novel knowledge-driven
   approach to developing a selection of biodiversity indicators that can
   then be rapidly and objectively measured within rangeland environments.
   Stakeholder and professional opinion on likely changes in biodiversity
   following reductions in sheep grazing was elicited using a
   workshop-based process. Potential variables suitable for use as
   biodiversity indicators were developed and professional opinion on their
   usefulness sought. A number of indicators were then tested in a natural
   experiment field study on the impact of reduced sheep grazing in
   Scotland. In the field study, red deer abundance appeared to increase
   where sheep grazing was reduced. It was therefore necessary to use
   estimates of both sheep and deer abundance as explanatory variables. In
   agreement with the professionals' predictions, dwarf shrub abundance and
   vegetation height were greater where sheep grazing had been reduced,
   after taking into account differences in deer. In contrast to the
   professionals' predictions, the field results showed rough grasses and
   dead material were less abundant where sheep had been reduced, with deer
   also having an impact on dead material. The professionals were unsure of
   the effects of reduced sheep grazing on vegetation mosaic structure; the
   field results suggested that reduced sheep grazing leads to a reduction
   in structural heterogeneity, but that deer had the greater impact in
   this case. Several other predictions showed nonsignificant differences
   in relation to reduced sheep grazing. The participatory method and some
   of the field methods presented are cost effective and widely applicable.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between genetic (allozyme) variation and landscape age and
   structure were investigated in 17 calcareous grassland demes of the moss
   Homalothecium lutescens (Hedw.) H. Rob. on the Baltic island of Oland.
   Mean within-deme gene diversity (H-S = 0.152) was moderate compared with
   other bryophyte studies, and the between-deme proportion of the total
   diversity (G(ST) = 0.100, Jost's D = 0.011) was low but significantly
   different from zero. Clonal mixing, measured as the proportion of two
   adjacent shoots having different haplotypes, was relatively high (mean
   0.32 over all demes). HS was higher in old grassland fragments, but
   negatively related to vascular plant species richness. Allelic richness
   (A) was positively associated with the area of old (>= 280 years)
   grassland in the surroundings: although demes in old grasslands are
   genetically more variable than those in younger grasslands, proximity to
   large areas of old grassland may promote genetic variability even in
   younger grassland demes. The importance of management continuity for
   species diversity has been stressed in many earlier grassland studies.
   Here, we conclude that grassland fragments with a long history of
   grazing continuity are also positively associated with variability at
   within-species level, as exemplified by the bryophyte H. lutescens.}},

Title = {{Predicting invertebrate herbivory from plant traits: Polycultures show

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1499-1509}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Plant functional traits affect the capacity of herbivores to find,
   choose, and consume plants. However, in a community composed of
   different plant species, it is unclear what proportion of herbivory on a
   focal plant is explained by its own traits and which is explained by the
   characteristics of the surrounding vegetation (i.e., nonadditive
   effects). Moreover, nonadditive effects could be positive or negative,
   and it is not known if they are related to community properties such as
   diversity. To quantify nonadditive effects, we developed four different
   additive models based on monoculture herbivory rates or plant traits and
   combined them with measurements of standing invertebrate herbivore
   damage along an experimental plant diversity gradient ranging from
   monocultures to 60-species mixtures. In all four models, positive
   nonadditive effects were detected, i.e., herbivory levels were higher in
   polycultures than what was expected from monoculture data, and these
   effects contributed up to 25\% of the observed variance in herbivory.
   Importantly, the nonadditive effects, which were defined as the deviance
   of the models' predictions from the observed herbivory, were positively
   correlated with the communities' plant species richness. Consequently,
   interspecific interactions appear to have an important impact on the
   levels of herbivory of a community. Identifying those community
   properties that capture the effects of these interactions is a next
   important challenge for our understanding of how the environment
   interacts with plant traits to drive levels of herbivory.}},

Abstract = {{Theory suggests that predators of soil-improving, plant-facilitating
   detritivores (e.g. earthworms) should suppress plant growth via a
   negative tri-trophic cascade, but the empirical evidence is still
   largely lacking. We tested this prediction in an alpine meadow on the
   Tibetan Plateau by manipulating predatory beetles (presence/absence) and
   quantifying (i) direct effects on the density and behaviour of
   earthworms; and (ii) indirect effects on soil properties and
   above-ground plant biomass. In the absence of predators, earthworms
   improved soil properties, but did not significantly affect plant
   biomass. Surprisingly, the presence of predators strengthened the
   positive effect of earthworms on soil properties leading to the
   emergence of a positive indirect effect of predators on plant biomass.
   We attribute this counterintuitive result to: (i) the inability of
   predators to suppress overall earthworm density; and (ii) the
   predator-induced earthworm habitat shift from the upper to lower soil
   layer that enhanced their soil-modifying, plant-facilitating, effects.
   Our results reveal that plant-level consequences of predators as
   transmitted through detritivores can hinge on behaviour-mediated
   indirect interactions that have the potential to overturn predictions
   based solely on trophic interactions. This work calls for a closer
   examination of the effects of predators in detritus food webs and the
   development of spatially explicit theory capable of predicting the
   occurrence and consequences of predator-induced detritivore behavioural
   shifts.}},

Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1049-1057}},

Abstract = {{Amensalism may be common between non-trophically linked animals in
   natural ecosystems, where variation among species in body sizes and
   foraging modes may give rise to one-sided interference. However, species
   and ecosystem-level consequences of animal-animal amensalism are largely
   unknown. In a Tibetan alpine meadow, dominant herbivorous grasshoppers
   trigger a death feigning anti-predator response of co-occurring
   grassland caterpillars despite posing no consumptive threat. We
   hypothesized that: 1) grasshoppers reduce the performance of
   caterpillars while incurring no cost to themselves; and 2) this
   amensalism reduces top-down control of plant composition and biomass. We
   tested these hypotheses by factorial manipulation of both herbivores
   within replicate field enclosures. Grasshoppers significantly suppressed
   caterpillar feeding, growth rate, survival, reproductive effort and
   delayed metamorphosis. In contrast, grasshopper performance was
   unaffected by the caterpillars. Suppression of caterpillar feeding
   decreased overall herbivore suppression of plant biomass by 58\% and
   shifted the functional composition of the plant community (i.e.
   increased sedge: forb ratio). These results suggest that consideration
   of non-trophic interactions such as amensalism will help predict the
   consequences of species losses for the structure and functioning of
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Question What are the effects of traditional drove roads on landscape
   pattern and plant communities? Location Madrid Autonomous Region,
   Central Spain. Methods We selected four study localities in different
   landscape units. Within each locality, we selected eight sites and
   within each site, we established three 1-ha plots, each corresponding to
   one of three situations: drove road, adjacent matrix or distant matrix.
   The landscape pattern of each plot was characterized by the cover of the
   different patch types, the patch type richness ha-1 and the patch type
   evenness ha-1. At one site per locality, we also recorded vegetation by
   randomly distributing twenty 20cmx20cm quadrats per plot. We
   characterized each quadrat by its species richness, plant species
   composition and plant functional composition. We also analysed species
   richness by constructing rarefaction curves for each plot. Results In
   the localities situated in croplands, sub-mediterranean forests and
   coniferous forests, drove roads were found to be an important source of
   spatial heterogeneity and a reservoir for a large number of plant
   species. In contrast, drove roads did not differ from the matrix
   habitats in rangelands, suggesting that the processes shaping drove road
   vegetation are similar to the general processes that shape grazed
   systems. Drove roads did not imply a significant increase in functional
   diversity. Our results were heavily scale-dependent: while drove roads
   provided heterogeneity at the local scale, they showed a remarkable
   similarity at the large scale. Conclusions Drove roads act as authentic
   local biodiversity reservoirs, especially in environments with low
   grazing levels. At the same time, drove roads imply structural and
   functional continuity on a large scale, increasing potential
   connectivity at the regional level. We recommend the preservation of
   drove roads in a functional state, because of their benefits to plant
   biodiversity conservation, and claim that these benefits should be
   considered when designing livestock policies with different
   intensification scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study: Processes that drive ecological dynamics differ
   across spatial scales. Therefore, the pathways through which plant
   communities and plant-insect relationships respond to changing
   environmental conditions are also expected to be scale-dependent.
   Furthermore, the processes that affect individual species or
   interactions at single sites may differ from those affecting communities
   across multiple sites.
   Methods: We reviewed and synthesized peer-reviewed literature to
   identify patterns in biotic or abiotic pathways underpinning changes in
   the composition and diversity of plant communities under three
   components of climate change (increasing temperature, CO2, and changes
   in precipitation) and how these differ across spatial scales. We also
   explored how these changes to plants affect plant-insect interactions.
   Key results: The relative frequency of biotic vs. abiotic pathways of
   climate effects at larger spatial scales often differ from those at
   smaller scales. Local-scale studies show variable responses to climate
   drivers, often driven by biotic factors. However, larger scale studies
   identify changes to species composition and/or reduced diversity as a
   result of abiotic factors. Differing pathways of climate effects can
   result from different responses of multiple species, habitat effects,
   and differing effects of invasions at local vs. regional to global
   scales. Plant community changes can affect higher trophic levels as a
   result of spatial or phenological mismatch, foliar quality changes, and
   plant abundance changes, though studies on plant-insect interactions at
   larger scales are rare.
   Conclusions: Climate-induced changes to plant communities will have
   considerable effects on community-scale trophic exchanges, which may
   differ from the responses of individual species or pairwise
   interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The influences of grazing exclusion on plant species composition and
   intrinsic water-use efficiency (W-i) of alpine grasslands on the
   Northern Tibet Plateau are not well understood. We conducted a multisite
   transect field survey across the three main alpine ecosystems (meadow,
   steppe, and desert steppe) with nine pairs of grazing-excluded and
   adjacent open grazed pastures. Short-term grazing exclusion (started in
   2006) did not result in significant changes in nutrients or bulk density
   of the surface soils (0-15 cm), but it slightly changed the aboveground
   biomass (AGB) and coverage at both community and species levels.
   Community foliar delta C-13 and W-i differed among alpine grassland
   types, with values for steppe being similar to those for meadow and with
   desert steppe values being higher than both of these. Foliar delta C-13
   and inferred W-i differed among the dominant species and varied
   negatively with precipitation and positively with temperature in 2010.
   These results confirm that there is an environmentally selective effect
   on the replacement of dominant species. There was no evident difference
   in foliar delta C-13 or W-i between grazing-excluded and open grazed
   sites, but there was a slight increase of AGB and coverage in
   grazing-excluded sites compared to open grazed ones at the species and
   community levels. These results indicated that grazing exclusion may
   have no clear influence on the physiological processes related to foliar
   water usage at the species level, but may have a cumulative effect on
   the carbon-water balance at the community level. Slight changes in
   linear regressions of foliar delta C-13 and W-i plotted across climatic
   gradients indicated that grasslands under grazing management might be
   more sensitive to regional climatic changes.}},

Title = {{Impacts of heavy grazing on plant species richness: A comparison across

Journal = {{SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{146-156}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The net effect of heavy grazing and land degradation on plant diversity
   and richness is insufficiently understood for incorporation in national
   biodiversity assessments. A study was undertaken to determine the
   effects of heavy grazing primarily on richness of vascular plant species
   across the arid and semi-arid rangeland biomes of South Africa. Major
   grazing contrasts were systematically identified for sampling in
   rangelands of Succulent Karoo, Nama-Karoo, Thicket, Grassland, Kalahari
   dune savanna and Mopane savanna. The related parameters of species
   diversity, evenness and turnover were also examined and analysed at the
   whole site level. The study represents a new site-level comparison of
   earlier individual studies that also necessitated recalculation and
   standardization of original data, where appropriate. Impacts of heavy
   grazing on plant species richness were found to vary from negligible or
   slightly positive to distinctly negative, depending on site. The sharp
   reductions in richness may have been associated with special secondary
   conditions that can occur in arid areas. Species diversity did not track
   species richness well and was often dominated by species evenness
   patterns. Moderate to substantial turnover of species occurred, even
   with negligible change in species richness. Species turnover was largely
   associated with replacement of species, except on one site where
   turnover was more evenly split between its replacement and nestedness
   components. Heavy grazing altered species composition on all study
   sites, usually with reduced grazing quality and favouring annual plants.
   Surprisingly few of the replacement species on most of the study areas
   were alien or exotic. Remarkably, the magnitude of change in.species
   richness across the limited rainfall gradient of the study often greatly
   exceeded changes associated with the heavy grazing levels at each site.
   Use of the significant non-linear relationship found between loss of
   plant canopy cover through grazing and the relative decline in species
   richness needs further exploration. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier

   dominant species were tussock grasses typical for rocky grasslands of
   the region. Five endangered species were found. The area presents a high

   in the West Songnen Plain, China}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{The West Songnen Plain is an ecologically fragile area. The grasslands
   on the plain have been seriously degraded over the past five decades and
   this process is continuing. The reliable estimation of grassland
   aboveground biomass (AGB) provides scientific data for determining the
   livestock stocking rate on rangeland. AGB is also of considerable
   significance for biodiversity and environmental protection in this
   region. Remote sensing is the most effective way to estimate grassland
   AGB on a regional scale. Multitemporal, remotely sensed data were used
   for grassland AGB estimation with statistical models and an artificial
   neural network (ANN), and the accuracy of estimation for these methods
   was compared. The results demonstrate that the use of multi-temporal
   remotely sensed data has advantages for grassland AGB estimation,
   whether with statistical models or ANN methods, compared with
   single-temporal remotely sensed data, although the ANN had a higher
   accuracy of estimation for grassland AGB. Finally, the grassland AGB on
   the Songnen Plain was estimated with the ANN using multitemporal MODIS
   data. The spatial distribution pattern of grassland AGB showed large
   variations, and grassland productivity was generally low. The maximum
   green weight of the grassland AGB was 927.22 g/m(2) and was mainly
   distributed on the northeast of the West Songnen Plain. The minimum
   green weight of the grassland AGB was 194.82 g/m(2) and was mainly
   distributed on the central and southwestern West Songnen Plain. Most of
   the areas had medium- and low-yielding grasses. The significant
   increases of population and livestock number were the primary and direct
   reasons for the decrease in grassland quality. This study will
   contribute to policy making for the control of grazing and for
   biodiversity and environmental protection. (C) 2013 Society of

Abstract = {{The present study provides the first detailed phytosociological
   description of the plant communities of Hulunbeier grassland, the
   easternmost part of the Eurasian steppe. Using phytosociological
   methods, vegetation data were collected from 109 plots in six areas
   spanning 300 km and covering a large proportion of the east-west axis of
   Hulunbeier steppe. Five main phytosociological plant communities were
   identified: meadow steppe of Veronico incanae-Stipetum baicalensis,
   ruderal vegetation of Cannabi-Sphallerocarpetum gracilis, steppe of Poo
   attenuatae-Stipetum grandis, heavily grazed steppe of Allium polyrhizum
   community, and Glycyrrhizo uralensis-Achnatherum splendens. The Poo
   attenuatae-Stipetum grandis was divided into two subunits: a Potentilla
   acaulis subassociation and a Caragana microphylla subassociation. The
   ordination of the communities showed a strong gradient from the drier
   western steppe to the wetter eastern steppe. Compared with 20 years ago,
   the zonal floristic composition had drastically changed from S. krylovii
   being dominant to the salt-tolerant A. polyrhizum and A. splendens
   becoming dominant. Species richness was lower in the communities nearby
   water sources suggesting intensive grazing and tramping than in the
   typical community of the steppe zone. Species richness was lower in the
   abandoned fields than in adjacent uncultivated sites. These results
   suggest that both grazing pressure and cultivation had changed the
   floristic composition and decreased the species richness in the area.}},

Abstract = {{A negative species richness-productivity relationship is often described
   in grasslands at smaller scales. We aimed to study the effect of
   management on this relationship. In particular, we addressed the
   relative importance of biomass cutting, hay removal and nutrient
   impoverishment on species richness and growth form structure. We
   conducted fieldwork in flooded meadows in Alam-Pedja Nature Reserve,
   central Estonia. We sampled vegetation in managed and abandoned stands
   of two types of alluvial meadows, sedge and tall forb meadow.
   Aboveground biomass and litter were harvested, weighed and analysed for
   major plant nutrients by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Three
   groups of general additive models were developed and compared,
   addressing the impact of (i) productivity, (ii) nutrients and (iii)
   management regime on species richness. Management-mowing and hay
   removal-reduced the amount of litter but not aboveground biomass.
   Management led to a decrease in nitrogen in the biomass and enhanced
   species richness, particularly in the tall forb meadow. The strongest
   determinant of species richness was the amount of litter, exhibiting a
   hump-shaped relationship with richness. The effect of nitrogen supply
   was significant, but explained less variation. Management increased the
   proportion of sedges in the sedge meadow and of small herbs in the tall
   forb meadow. We conclude that litter removal is the most important
   management means to support biodiversity. On highly productive sites,
   reducing nutrients via hay removal is of secondary importance within a
   timeframe of 10 years.}},

Title = {{Competition and facilitation between a native and a domestic herbivore:
   trade-offs between forage quantity and quality}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{850-863}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Potential competition between native and domestic herbivores is a major
   consideration influencing the management and conservation of native
   herbivores in rangeland ecosystems. In grasslands of the North American
   Great Plains, black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) are
   widely viewed as competitors with cattle but are also important for
   biodiversity conservation due to their role in creating habitat for
   other native species. We examined spatiotemporal variation in prairie
   dog effects on growing-season forage quality and quantity using
   measurements from three colony complexes in Colorado and South Dakota
   and from a previous study of a fourth complex in Montana. At two
   complexes experiencing below-average precipitation, forage availability
   both on and off colonies was so low (12-54 g/m(2)) that daily forage
   intake rates of cattle were likely constrained by instantaneous intake
   rates and daily foraging time. Under these dry conditions, prairie dogs
   (1) substantially reduced forage availability, thus further limiting
   cattle daily intake rates, and (2) had either no or a small positive
   effect on forage digestibility. Under such conditions, prairie dogs are
   likely to compete with cattle in direct proportion to their abundance.
   For two complexes experiencing above-average precipitation, forage
   quantity on and off colonies (77-208 g/m(2)) was sufficient for daily
   forage intake of cattle to be limited by digestion rather than
   instantaneous forage intake. At one complex where prairie dogs enhanced
   forage digestibility and {[}N] while having no effect on forage
   quantity, prairie dogs are predicted to facilitate cattle mass gains
   regardless of prairie dog abundance. At the second complex where prairie
   dogs enhanced digestibility and {[}N] but reduced forage quantity,
   effects on cattle can vary from competition to facilitation depending on
   prairie dog abundance. Our findings show that the high spatiotemporal
   variation in vegetation dynamics characteristic of semiarid grasslands
   is paralleled by variability in the magnitude of competition between
   native and domestic grazers. Competitive interactions evident during dry
   periods may be partially or wholly offset by facilitation during periods
   when forage digestibility is enhanced and forage quantity does not limit
   the daily intake rate of cattle.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands in Sweden are species-rich, and their natural
   values are strongly dependent on continuous management, mainly by
   grazing. However, the large heterogeneity in vegetation within and
   between grassland sites must be taken into account when designing
   management and preservation schemes, calling for precise field
   monitoring and assessment of habitat type and land use history. We have
   evaluated different surrogate measures to assess community composition
   and biodiversity of the most common vegetation types in grazed
   semi-natural pastures. We compared the complete plant community, two
   reduced checklists intended for quick surveys of the plant community,
   and the ant community. The results suggest that the taxonomic resolution
   in a plant inventory is important for both biodiversity assessment and
   recognition of vegetation types. The extent of a reduced species
   checklist was of greater importance than its quality for describing the
   plant community. Reduced checklists should only be used if they comprise
   species with known affinity to the studied vegetation types. We also
   found that plants and ants experience grazed semi-natural grasslands in
   different ways. Ant communities did not resemble the communities deduced
   from plant inventories, or vegetation types recognised by field staff.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally managed village yards have been disappearing from the
   Central-European countryside. Their lawn flora is likely to provide a
   unique habitat for many plants that are adapted to this environment.
   Composition of lawn flora was investigated in differently managed
   village yards (i.e., regularly mown and regularly trampled yards,
   poultry yards, paved yards) in southwestern Hungary. The main goal of
   the study was to detect the impacts of these different management
   regimes on the composition and diversity of the vegetation. In total,
   240 1-m(2) plots were sampled in 60 yards ranging from 80 m(2) to 5,000
   m(2) in size. In the redundancy analysis, eight significant variables
   (degree of southness, slope, age, total size of yards; mowing, trampling
   and grazing regime; and the number of dogs) explained 16 \% of the total
   variation in species data. The most diverse flora across yards was
   detected in the paved ones, and their stands also proved to be the most
   compositionally distinctive. In contrast, presence of domestic animals
   can contribute to local species loss as well as to a decrease in
   within-yard-type variability. These results highlight the importance of
   certain anthropogenic disturbances in maintaining high plant diversity,
   but also underline the crucial role of small-scale land management
   practices in rural environments.}},

Abstract = {{The Irano-Turanian floristic region is a major center of endemism in the
   Holarctic of Eurasia. The Alborz Mountains of northern Iran are a
   complex and heterogeneous environmental system with rich water resources
   and great habitat diversity. We have investigated steppe plant
   communities along an altitudinal gradient ranging from approximately
   1,000 m a.s.l. in the semi-desert steppes near Tehran to a height of
   3,966 m a.s.l. at the summit of Mount Tochal. Our two-way indicator
   species analysis of 1,069 vegetation samples resulted in classification
   of five major vegetation zones: (1) a semi-desert Artemisia steppe near
   Tehran, (2) a Stipa grassland in the alluvial undulating hills north and
   west of Tehran, (3) a submontane and steppe zone, (4) a subalpine
   cushion formation zone and (5) an alpine meadow and subnival zone of
   Mount Tochal. Annuals and ephemerals in the semi-desert vegetation
   decline as altitude increases and almost disappear in the alpine zone.
   Past human impacts of ancient Persian civilization and a traditional
   pastoral economy have affected the physiognomy of plant communities;
   thorny dwarf shrubs now dominate the treeless vegetation of the region.
   Lower competition for space, different phenology and the presence of
   edaphic and hydrological layers associated with anthropogenic impacts
   are major reasons for entanglement of different plant communities in the
   arid- and semi-arid steppe. The phytogeography of the region changes
   from omni-Irano-Turanian and Saharo-Sindian transgressive species at
   lower altitudes to a more limited range of western Irano-Turanian
   species and local endemics at higher altitudes.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing land use intensity and human influence are leading to a
   reduction in plant and animal species diversity. However, little is
   known about how these changes may affect higher trophic levels, apart
   from simply reducing species numbers. Here we investigated, over 3years,
   the influence of different land practices on a tritrophic system in
   grassland habitats. The system consisted of the host plant Plantago
   lanceolata L. (Plantaginaceae), two monophagous weevils, Mecinus labilis
   Herbst and Mecinus pascuorum Gyllenhal (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and
   their parasitoid Mesopolobus incultus Walker (Hymenoptera:
   Pteromalidae). At over 70 sites across three geographic regions in
   Germany, we measured plant species diversity and vegetation structure,
   as well as abundance of P.lanceolata, the two weevils, and the
   parasitoid. Land use intensity (fertilization) and type (mowing vs.
   grazing) negatively affected not only plant species richness but also
   the occurrence of the two specialized herbivores and their parasitoid.
   In contrast, land use had a mostly positive effect on host plant size,
   vegetation structure, and parasitization rate. This study reveals that
   intensification of land use influences higher trophic organisms even
   without affecting the availability of the host plant. The observed
   relationships between land use, vegetation complexity, and the
   tritrophic system are not restricted locally; rather they are
   measureable along a broad range of environmental conditions and years
   throughout Germany. Our findings may have important implications for the
   conservation of insect species of nutrient-poor grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Vertebrate herbivores can be key determinants of grassland plant species
   richness, although the magnitude of their effects can largely depend on
   ecosystem and herbivore characteristics. It has been demonstrated that
   the combined effect of primary productivity and body size is critical
   when assessing the impact of herbivores on plant richness of
   perennial-dominated grasslands; however, the interaction of site
   productivity and herbivore size as determinants of plant richness in
   annual-dominated pastures remains unknown. We experimentally partitioned
   primary productivity and herbivore body size (sheep and wild rabbits) to
   study the effect of herbivores on the plant species richness of a
   Mediterranean semiarid annual plant community in central Spain over six
   years. We also analyzed the effect of grazing and productivity on the
   evenness and species composition of the plant community, and green
   cover, litter, and plant height. We found that plant richness was higher
   where the large herbivore was present at high-productivity sites but
   barely changed at low productivity. The small herbivore did not affect
   species richness at either productivity site despite its large effects
   on species composition. We propose that adaptations to resource scarcity
   and herbivory prevented plant richness changes at low-productivity
   sites, whereas litter accumulation in the absence of herbivores
   decreased plant richness at high productivity. Our results are
   consistent with predictions arising from a long history of grazing and
   highlight the importance of both large and small herbivores to the
   maintenance of plant diversity of Mediterranean annual-dominated
   pastures.}},

Title = {{Managing uplands for biodiversity: Do agri-environment schemes deliver
   benefits for breeding lapwing Vanellus vanellus?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{794-804}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Within Europe, agri-environment schemes are the key delivery mechanism
   for biodiversity conservation outside protected areas. Schemes have a
   range of land management options designed to deliver outcomes for target
   habitats or species. Breeding waders form an important part of the
   biodiversity of upland grasslands, and in the UK, there are multiple
   land management options within agri-environment schemes designed to
   benefit waders. We assessed whether such options improve the suitability
   of breeding habitat and population dynamics for a declining wader, the
   lapwing Vanellus vanellus. The suitability of nesting and chick-rearing
   habitat was better on land with agri-environment scheme management, and
   breeding densities and productivity increased with habitat suitability.
   The lapwing populations declined during this study, and trends did not
   differ between agri-environment and non-agri-environment scheme land.
   Productivity was below that required for population stability, although
   there was evidence of higher productivity on agri-environment scheme
   land in later years. Agri-environment management consisted of multiple
   land management options that varied in delivery of suitable habitat,
   breeding densities and success. The best management options were all in
   England on land benefiting from specific management advice or with rough
   grazing and grazed pasture agri-environment scheme options. Synthesis
   and applications. Despite considerable investment and positive effects
   of agri-environment schemes on habitat quality, populations of lapwing
   in the UK uplands have declined because of inadequate productivity. For
   species with complex requirements, populations are only likely to
   increase when all of these requirements are provided. Appropriately
   targeted habitat management, delivered through agri-environment schemes,
   can play an important role in improving habitat quality and increasing
   landscape diversity. However, when populations are limited by something
   other than habitat quality, for example, predation, then habitat
   management alone is unlikely to recover populations. Increasing evidence
   suggests that predation impacts are also likely to be important for
   ground-nesting species such as lapwing. Predator management may
   therefore need to be integrated with habitat measures where predation is
   limiting breeding success and population recovery.}},

   Service?}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{483-493}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Tussock-forming plants are globally widespread and enhance ecosystem
   services. We hypothesized that tussocks of Carex stricta store carbon
   (C) in addition to enhancing microtopography and biodiversity. We
   characterized tussock size, composition, and carbon pools associated
   with three undisturbed C. stricta-dominated tussock meadows in the Upper
   Midwest, USA. Remnant meadow tussocks were tall (17.2 cm), voluminous
   (4,113 cm(3)), and largely organic (95 \%), indicating their ability to
   accumulate organic matter and store carbon. Tussocks were the second
   largest C pool (next to soil) in these ecosystems; they comprised 41-62
   \% of total biomass C. Using bomb C-14 dating, we estimated that
   reference-site tussocks were over 50 years old. Their long-term
   persistence is consistent with lower leaf decomposition rates on
   tussocks (k = 0.26 years(-1)) than in tussock interspaces (k = 0.39
   years(-1)). An urban tussock meadow had tussocks that were shorter than
   those of remnant sites, but less dense than a restored meadow. The
   restored meadow (a parts per thousand currency sign15 years) had
   smaller, structurally distinct tussocks that stored less C. Among the
   five sites, C stocks were lowest in the urban and restored meadows,
   supporting the need to conserve existing C stores in remnant meadows and
   to restore tussock sedge for multiple ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Cumberland Plain grassy woodland in western Sydney has been reduced to
   less than 12\% of its pre-settlement distribution; efforts to restore it
   on cleared and grazed sites within its former distribution have met with
   mixed success. Elevated soil nitrate levels, coupled with propagule and
   establishment limitation, have been identified as barriers to
   restoration in other grasslands. Our study used a factorial combination
   of carbon addition, fire and native seed addition to test whether these
   barriers operated on a former Cumberland plain woodland site dominated
   by exotic perennial grasses. Replicate field plots were established in
   November 2004; fire plots were burnt in December 2004; carbon was then
   added as sugar every 3months until September 2005; and seeds of five
   native grasses were added in January 2005. Carbon addition significantly
   reduced soil nitrate, the effect appearing in October 2005. Carbon
   addition and fire each reduced the total abundance of exotics; when
   combined, they halved the abundance of the two dominant exotic grasses.
   Total abundance of native species responded positively to carbon and
   seed addition, but significant responses to carbon were not detected for
   individual species. Abundance of two native grasses responded positively
   to fire; after treatment the native proportion of total abundance rose
   from 26\% on controls to 4465\% on carbon and/or fire plots. Exotic
   species richness was decreased independently by carbon addition and
   fire. Native species richness was increased independently by fire and
   seed addition. All five native grasses established sporadically, but
   only on carbon and/or fire plots. The three treatments each
   significantly and independently affected species composition, which
   showed the greatest change when all three were applied. The three
   treatments collectively increased the proportion of natives in measures
   of both plant abundance and species richness. The study confirmed that
   elevated soil nitrate, plus propagule and recruitment limitation are
   barriers to restoring this grassy woodland on cleared and grazed sites.}},

   pasture}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{297}},
Pages = {{49-56}},

Abstract = {{Reforestation of former pastures with native timber trees holds
   potential to improve small-scale farmers livelihoods while supporting
   ecosystem functioning and biological diversity. To promote successful
   reforestation with native tree species, more knowledge is needed,
   particularly on effects of species identity, tree diversity, and
   insecticide application on tree survival and growth at different time
   periods after plantation establishment. We assessed these effects for
   three native Central American timber species and compared results gained
   2 and 5 years after tree establishment. Survival, stem diameter, and
   tree height were quantified for Tabebuia rosea, Anacardium excelsum, and
   Cedrela odorata, planted in (1) monocultures, (2) three-species
   mixtures, and (3) three-species mixtures treated with insecticides
   during the first 2 years of seedling establishment. We further tested
   how survival and growth performance were affected by the individual tree
   position within reforestation tree stands to account for border effects
   in small-scale tree patches in pasture-afforestations. Survival was
   significantly affected by tree species identity with the highest
   survival in T. rosea and the lowest survival in C. odorata. Tree growth
   was affected by tree species identity, tree diversity, insecticide
   treatment, environmental heterogeneity, and border effects, but these
   effects varied across the individual tree species. Interspecific
   analyses revealed significant differences between species. A. excelsum
   trees attained the largest and C. odorata the smallest size after 5
   years of growth. Across species, tree growth in years 3-5 after tree
   planting was highest in mixtures treated with insecticides during tree
   establishment, followed by monocultures and then unprotected mixtures.
   Enhanced growth in monocultures compared to unprotected mixtures was
   particularly found in T. rosea during early establishment, and in A.
   excelsum at a later stage of tree stand development. Growth-enhancing
   effects of planting schemes may be related to differential responses to
   herbivore damage and to tree-tree competition. Positive border effects,
   i.e. a significantly enhanced growth at the border of a tree stand, were
   found for T. rosea in all three planting schemes and for A. excelsum in
   protected mixtures. Our results suggest that besides early, restricted
   insecticide application, tree diversity within stands should be
   considered as management measure to enhance timber tree growth on former
   pasture. The finding of enhanced growth of native timber trees at the
   border of small tree stands suggests small patches of native timber
   trees planted on former pasture as a promising reforestation strategy in
   Latin America. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of a 16-year mowing experiment performed
   in fluviogenous wetland of the Narewka River valley, NE Poland. The main
   objective of the study was to evaluate whether the floristic composition
   of an abandoned wet meadow can be restored by the reestablishment of
   mowing once species richness has declined following the encroachment of
   rushes. We found that management in the form of annual mowing at the
   turn of June and July had a strong effect on wetland vegetation and led
   to substantial increase in species diversity and richness and supported
   development of many meadow species. This favorable reaction was observed
   only in first initial years after implementation of management - in the
   long run influence of mowing was modified by hydrological factors. These
   results confirmed a link between the species richness and the habitat
   conditions of the wetland, which varied in response to the water input
   from snowmelt and precipitation. Mowing failed to eliminate the most
   expansive tall fast-growing generalist species and despite many years of
   management vegetation still resembled a rush community dominated by tall
   grasses: Calamagrostis canescens and Phragmites australis. We
   hypothesize that mowing alone is not adequate to suppress rush species.
   It is highly probable that management must be accompanied by appropriate
   hydrological conditions, among which long-lasting flooding (in late
   summer) is of great importance. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Agricultural systems rely on healthy soils and their sustainability
   requires understanding the long-term impacts of agricultural practices
   on soils, including microbial communities. We examined the impact of 17
   years of land management on soil bacterial communities in a New Zealand
   randomized-block pasture trial. Significant variation in bacterial
   community structure related to mowing and plant biomass removal, while
   nitrogen fertilizer had no effect. Changes in soil chemistry and legume
   abundance described 52\% of the observed variation in the bacterial
   community structure. Legumes (Trifolium species) were absent in
   unmanaged plots but increased in abundance with management intensity;
   11\% of the variation in soil bacterial community structure was
   attributed to this shift in the plant community. Olsen P explained 10\%
   of the observed heterogeneity, which is likely due to persistent biomass
   removal resulting in P limitation; Olsen P was significantly lower in
   plots with biomass removed (14mg kg1 +/- 1.3SE) compared with plots that
   were not mown, or where biomass was left after mowing (32mg kg1 +/-
   1.6SE). Our results suggest that removal of plant biomass and associated
   phosphorus, as well as shifts in the plant community, have greater
   long-term impacts on soil bacterial community structure than application
   of nitrogen fertilizers.}},

Abstract = {{For the protection or re-establishment of species-rich grasslands, the
   limiting factors controlling species richness have increasingly become
   of scientific interest. This study aims to analyze the role of
   disturbance for the occurrence of a low-competitive herb, Centaurium
   erythraea Rafn, in mesotrophic, lowland grasslands in NW Germany. We
   sampled a total of 38 plots with presence of C. erythraea and 24 control
   (random) plots in semi-natural grasslands. As a proxy for disturbance,
   we estimated the cover of bare ground and Ellenberg flooding indicator
   species and measured the distance between the plot and the nearest path.
   Moreover, we counted the number of C. erythraea individuals within each
   plot. In the GLM analyses the distance from path was the only predictor;
   both the presence of the species and the number of individuals decreased
   with the distance from path. The grasslands at the path edges had the
   highest disturbance intensity. Here horse riding, military-vehicle
   traffic and regular sod-cutting directly create bare ground. In general,
   disturbance creating bare ground seems to be the key factor enabling
   germination and growth of C. erythraea in mesotrophic grasslands and
   other low-competitive short-lived species. Disturbance enhances the
   expression of the seed bank, favours the development of the
   shade-avoiding and low-growing rosettes and oppresses tall-growing
   competitors. Therefore we suggest grazing as the best management method.}},

Abstract = {{Ammonia (NH3) emission and redeposition play a major role in terrestrial
   nitrogen (N) cycles and can also cause environmental problems, such as
   changes in biodiversity, soil acidity, and eutrophication. Previous
   field grazing experiments showed inconsistent (positive, neutral, and
   negative) NH3 volatilization from soils in response to varying grazing
   intensities. However, it remains unclear whether, or to what extent, NH3
   emissions from soil are affected by increasing grazing intensities in
   Inner Mongolian grasslands. Using a 5-year grazing experiment, we
   investigated the relationship between NH3 volatilization from soil and
   grazing pressure (0.0, 3.0, 6.0, and 9.0 sheep/hm(2)) from June to
   September of 2009 and 2010 via the vented-chamber method. The results
   show that soil NH3 volatilization was not significantly different at
   different grazing intensities in 2009, although it was higher at the
   highest stocking rate during 2010. There was no significant linear
   relationship between soil NH3 volatilization rates and soil NH4+-N, but
   soil NH3 volatilization rates were significantly related to soil water
   content and air temperature. Grazing intensities had no significant
   influence on soil NH3 volatilization. Soil NH3 emissions from June to
   September (grazing period), averaged over all grazing intensities, were
   9.6 +/- 0.2 and 19.0 +/- 0.2 kg N/hm(2) in 2009 and 2010, respectively.
   Moreover, linear equations describing monthly air temperature and
   precipitation showed a good fit to changes in soil NH3 emissions
   (r=0.506, P=0.014). Overall, grazing intensities had less influence than
   that of climatic factors on soil NH3 emissions. Our findings provide new
   insights into the effects of grazing on NH3 volatilization from soil in
   Inner Mongolian grasslands, and have important implications for
   understanding N cycles in grassland ecosystems and for estimating soil
   NH3 emissions on a regional scale.}},

Abstract = {{Although agricultural habitats can provide enormous amounts of food
   resources for pollinator species, links between agricultural and
   (semi-)natural habitats through dispersal and foraging movements have
   hardly been studied. In 67 study sites, we assessed the interactions
   between mass-flowering oilseed rape fields and semi-natural grasslands
   at different spatial scales, and their effects on the number of brood
   cells of a solitary cavity-nesting bee. The probability that the bee
   Osmia bicornis colonized trap nests in oilseed rape fields increased
   from 12 to 59 \% when grassland was nearby, compared to fields isolated
   from grassland. In grasslands, the number of brood cells of O. bicornis
   in trap nests was 55 \% higher when adjacent to oilseed rape compared to
   isolated grasslands. The percentage of oilseed rape pollen in the larval
   food was higher in oilseed rape fields and grasslands adjacent to
   oilseed rape than in isolated grasslands. In both oilseed rape fields
   and grasslands, the number of brood cells was positively correlated with
   the percentage of oilseed rape pollen in the larval food. We show that
   mass-flowering agricultural habitats-even when they are intensively
   managed-can strongly enhance the abundance of a solitary bee species
   nesting in nearby semi-natural habitats. Our results suggest that
   positive effects of agricultural habitats have been underestimated and
   might be very common (at least) for generalist species in landscapes
   consisting of a mixture of agricultural and semi-natural habitats. These
   effects might also have-so far overlooked-implications for interspecific
   competition and mutualistic interactions in semi-natural habitats.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY \& DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Background: Plant diversity can influence numerous ecosystem processes,
   including plant-animal interactions, which, in turn, will affect plant
   growth and fitness. At present, little is known on how plant-animal
   interactions in forests respond to gradients in tree and herb-layer
   diversity.
   Aims: To quantify how invertebrate herbivory, pollination-dependent seed
   production and post-dispersal seed predation vary along a gradient of
   tree and herb diversity in a semi-natural temperate deciduous forest.
   Methods: Potted individuals of the understorey herbs Lathyrus vernus and
   Primula elatior were exposed in 40 forest plots along a natural gradient
   of tree and herb diversity for 3 months to record seed production and
   leaf damage caused by invertebrate herbivores. In half the plants,
   pollinators were experimentally excluded to test if seed production
   depended on insect pollination. In Lathyrus vernus linkages between
   below- and above-ground herbivory were tested by inoculating plants with
   root-feeding nematodes. To study seed predation, we measured seed
   removal from seed depots that were selectively accessible to different
   seed predator groups.
   Results: Herbivore damage decreased with increasing tree diversity in P.
   elatior. In L. vernus, above-ground herbivory was higher in
   nematode-treated plants than in control plants. Seed production in L.
   vernus, which strongly depended on insect pollination, showed a positive
   relationship with tree diversity. Seed predation was positively related
   to herb diversity in L. vernus, but only weakly so in P. elatior. While
   both vertebrates and invertebrates acted as seed predators of L. vernus,
   seeds of P. elatior were mainly predated by invertebrates.
   Conclusions: The fitness of understorey plants is linked to tree and
   herb diversity via changes in plant-invertebrate interactions. However,
   species-specific responses of study plants underline the importance of
   species identity effects in addition to effects of biodiversity per se.}},

Abstract = {{Agri-environment schemes (AES) have been implemented to cope with the
   loss of farmland biodiversity due to agricultural intensification over
   the last decades. In France, grassland measures (more closely linked to
   extensive grazing) are the most widely implemented within the French
   AES, and are presumably those whose effectiveness can be better
   assessed. In this paper, we have evaluated the effectiveness of French
   grassland agri-environmental measures (gAES) to enhance farmland bird
   diversity on a national scale, using local abundances of 19 farmland
   breeding birds within 463 Small Agricultural Regions (SAR) covering
   France during 2001-2008. We modeled responses of species abundances and
   estimated species richness to five categories of grassland AES,
   accounting for the characteristics of local production systems.
   Extensive management of grasslands had a positive effect on species
   richness. Despite mixed results on the effectiveness of the different
   grassland AES categories, our results are optimistic in terms of the
   ability of some French AES to provide benefits to birds. It seems that
   some grassland AES have achieved their objectives while meeting species
   ecological requirements. Moreover, this study highlights the fact that
   some of these grassland AES have the potential to enhance the population
   dynamics of declining species. Finally, although they all aim at
   benefitting biodiversity, it cannot be assumed that grassland measures
   lead to uniform conservation benefits. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Herbivory of an invasive slug is affected by earthworms and the
   composition of plant communities}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{MAY 13}},
Abstract = {{Background: Biodiversity loss and species invasions are among the most
   important human-induced global changes. Moreover, these two processes
   are interlinked as ecosystem invasibility is considered to increase with
   decreasing biodiversity. In temperate grasslands, earthworms serve as
   important ecosystem engineers making up the majority of soil faunal
   biomass. Herbivore behaviour has been shown to be affected by
   earthworms, however it is unclear whether these effects differ with the
   composition of plant communities. To test this we conducted a mesocosm
   experiment where we added earthworms (Annelida: Lumbricidae) to planted
   grassland communities with different plant species composition (3 vs. 12
   plant spp.). Plant communities had equal plant densities and ratios of
   the functional groups grasses, non-leguminous forbs and legumes. Later,
   Arion vulgaris slugs (formerly known as A. lusitanicus; Gastropoda:
   Arionidae) were added and allowed to freely choose among the available
   plant species. This slug species is listed among the 100 worst alien
   species in Europe. We hypothesized that (i) the food choice of slugs
   would be altered by earthworms' specific effects on the growth and
   nutrient content of plant species, (ii) slug herbivory will be less
   affected by earthworms in plant communities containing more plant
   species than in those with fewer plant species because of a more readily
   utilization of plant resources making the impacts of earthworms less
   pronounced.
   Results: Slug herbivory was significantly affected by both earthworms
   and plant species composition. Slugs damaged 60\% less leaves when
   earthworms were present, regardless of the species composition of the
   plant communities. Percent leaf area consumed by slugs was 40\% lower in
   communities containing 12 plant species; in communities containing only
   three species earthworms increased slug leaf area consumption. Grasses
   were generally avoided by slugs. Leaf length and number of tillers was
   increased in mesocosms containing more plant species but little
   influenced by earthworms. Overall shoot biomass was decreased, root
   biomass increased in plant communities with more plant species.
   Earthworms decreased total shoot biomass in mesocosms with more plant
   species but did not affect biomass production of individual functional
   groups. Plant nitrogen concentrations across three focus species were
   18\% higher when earthworms were present; composition of plant
   communities did not affect plant quality.
   Conclusions: Given the important role that both herbivores and
   earthworms play in structuring plant communities the implications of
   belowground-aboveground linkages should more broadly be considered when
   investigating global change effects on ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{213-222}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Cessation of agricultural management and subsequent natural forest
   succession has been the primary land use change in the Southern Alps
   over the past 50 years. It is generally assumed that early stages of
   succession host more plant species than grazed pastures, but that this
   richness is partly lost as the density of woody species increases. Based
   on vegetation surveys on eight sites in the Italian Alps, we found the
   effects of forest succession on plant species richness to depend
   strongly on environmental conditions. The relationship between plant
   species richness and wood cover at the sites ranged from non-detectable
   over hump-shaped, to monotonically decreasing. Linear mixed-effects
   models indicate that high mean annual temperature is associated with a
   strong decrease in plant species richness and in the number of red-list
   species along the pasture-to-forest gradient. Sampling plant species
   composition at a range of scales allowed us to rule out artefacts caused
   by modified species area relationships as a consequence of changes in
   wood cover. Multi-scale sampling also indicated that the primary loss of
   plant species richness by forest succession is in plant species with low
   abundance. Our data further allow assessment of the risk of species loss
   in mountain grasslands in the Southern Alps, which is highest on sites
   with higher mean annual temperature. These areas should receive
   concentrated attention and support for biodiversity conservation. (C)

Title = {{Seed availability in hay meadows: Land-use intensification promotes seed

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{171}},

Abstract = {{Intensification of land use in semi-natural hay meadows has resulted in
   a decrease in species diversity. This is often thought to be caused by
   the reduced establishment of plant species due to high competition for
   light under conditions of increased productivity. Sowing experiments in
   grasslands have found reliable evidence that diversity can also be
   constrained by seed availability, implying that processes influencing
   the production and persistence of seeds may be important for the
   functioning of ecosystems. So far, the effects of land-use
   intensification on the seed rain and the persistence of seeds in the
   soil have been unclear.
   We selected six pairs of extensively managed (Festuco-Brometea) and
   intensively managed (Arrhenatheretalia) grassland with traditional late
   cutting regimes across Switzerland and covering an annual productivity
   gradient in the range 176-1211 gm(-2). In each grassland community, we
   estimated seed rain and seed bank using eight pooled seed-trap or
   topsoil samples of 89 cm(2) in each of six plots representing an area of
   c. 150 m(2). The seed traps were established in spring 2010 and
   collected simultaneously with soil cores after an exposure of c. three
   months. We applied the emergence method in a cold frame over eight
   months to estimate density of viable seeds.
   With community productivity reflecting land-use intensification, the
   density and species richness in the seed rain increased, while mean seed
   size diminished and the proportions of persistent seeds and of species
   with persistent seeds in the topsoil declined. Stronger limitation of
   seeds in extensively managed semi-natural grasslands can explain the
   fact that such grasslands are not always richer in species than more
   intensively managed ones. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{. 1.Arthropods, a major component of functional biodiversity within
   agro-ecosystems, contribute to sustainability through processes
   including nutrient cycling and pest control. Extensively managed field
   margins can help protect this functional biodiversity by providing
   habitat for beneficial species. 2.This 2year study investigated the
   relative benefits of grassland field margin treatments (Fenced only,
   Rotavated, and Reseeded (with a grass and wildflower mixture)) on the
   abundance and taxon richness of five arthropod trophic groups
   (detritivores, herbivores, predators, parasitoids and hyperparasitoids)
   from the orders Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Araneae.
   3.The taxon richness and abundance of all trophic groups (with the
   exception of herbivore abundance) was greater in fenced field margin
   treatments than in the adjacent grazed field, particularly by the final
   sampling occasion. However, there were seasonal differences, with
   abundance and taxon richness generally greater in August than in June.
   Only detritivores and herbivores responded to the individual fenced
   field margin treatments. The botanically more species rich, rotavated
   and reseeded treatments, had greater detritivore and herbivore richness
   and abundance than the fenced only treatments. 4.Community structure
   analysis indicated that the grazed (within) field and fenced field
   margins had two distinct communities for all trophic groups,
   demonstrating the conservation value of the margins within intensively
   managed agricultural grasslands. 5.The current Irish agri-environment
   scheme requires fencing of field margins. Our results highlight how this
   relatively simple measure can benefit arthropod conservation and
   functional biodiversity. This may in turn benefit farm productivity
   through potentially improved nutrient cycling and natural pest control.}},

Abstract = {{Stocking rate manipulation was examined as a means of improving plant
   diversity (as a measure of pasture sustainability and forage value) in a
   native grass pasture used for dairy production in the humid tropics of
   Veracruz, Mexico. Given that environmental impact reduces biotic
   diversity, plant phylogenetic and functional diversity should decline
   with increased stocking rate. Stocking rates of 2, 3, and 4 cows.ha(-1)
   and a rotational grazing plan of 3 d of occupation and 27 d of rest per
   pasture were applied continuously over 5 yr. Across 200 quadrats in each
   of two replicate paddocks per treatment, observed species richness,
   phylogenetic diversity (average taxonomic distinctness based on species
   presence/absence), and functional diversity (life-cycle duration and
   growth habit) were assessed. Most species were forb/herbs and
   forb/herb-subshrubs. Perennial species declined with increased stocking
   rate (F=16.36, 0.05> P> 0.02) while annual-perennial species increased
   (F=76.88, 0.01 > P> 0.005); the proportion of annual species was least
   prominent and did not differ significantly. Observed species richness
   and phylogenetic diversity did not differ significantly with stocking
   rate. The correlation between functional diversity for life-cycle
   duration and phylogenetic diversity was significant and positive,
   suggesting that plant communities were predominantly assembled randomly
   from the surrounding species pool rather than through interspecies
   interactions acting to naturally filter immigrant species, thus leading
   to more opportunistic and undesired species. Although grazing pressure
   was not sufficient to alter indices or production measures, they did
   reveal shifts that may precede further pasture decline, indicating
   pasture sustainability was not being achieved. These rapid assessment
   methods permit monitoring for early warnings of reductions in pasture
   sustainability and forage quality for cattle.}},

   with two herbicide treatments applied either early and middle season or
   early and late season, but it was prevented with burning and mowing
   prior to herbicide application. With the exception of three herbicide
   applications, combining burning or mowing with herbicide applications
   provided more effective control of yellow bluestem than any individual
   herbicide applications. Burning or mowing likely improves glyphosate
   effectiveness by altering the invasive grass structure so that plants
   are clear of standing dead and have shorter, active regrowth to enhance
   herbicide effectiveness. During restoration projects requiring control
   of invasive yellow bluestem, an effective management option is a
   combination of mechanical and chemical control.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in agricultural practices of semi-natural mountain grasslands
   are expected to modify plant community structure and shift dominance
   patterns. Using vegetation surveys of 11 sites in semi-natural
   grasslands of the Swiss Jura and Swiss and French Alps, we determined
   the relative contribution of dominant, subordinate and transient plant
   species in grazed and abandoned communities and observed their changes
   along a gradient of productivity and in response to abandonment of
   pasturing. The results confirm the humpbacked diversity-productivity
   relationship in semi-natural grassland, which is due to the increase of
   subordinate species number at intermediate productivity levels. Grazed
   communities, at the lower or higher end of the species diversity
   gradient, suffered higher species loss after grazing abandonment.
   Species loss after abandonment of pasturing was mainly due to a higher
   reduction in the number of subordinate species, as a consequence of the
   increasing proportion of dominant species.
   When plant biodiversity maintenance is the aim, our results have direct
   implications for the way grasslands should be managed. Indeed, while
   intensification and abandonment have been accelerated since few decades,
   our findings in this multi-site analysis confirm the importance of
   maintaining intermediate levels of pasturing to preserve biodiversity.}},

Title = {{The impact of plant diversity and fertilization on fitness of a

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{246-254}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{In many environments land use intensification is likely to result in a
   decrease in species richness and in an increase in eutrophication.
   Although the importance of both factors for higher trophic levels such
   as insect herbivores is well documented, their impact has rarely been
   studied in combination. Herbivorous insects have a strong impact on the
   functioning of ecosystems and it is therefore important to understand
   how they are affected by eutrophication in high or low diversity
   environments.
   We used a grassland biodiversity experiment to investigate the combined
   effect of fertilization and plant diversity loss on the fitness of the
   generalist grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus by rearing grasshopper
   nymphs for four weeks in cages on unfertilized or fertilized (NPK)
   subplots across a species richness gradient from 1 to 60 plant species.
   Survival, the number of oothecae, body mass and the number of hatchlings
   were measured separately for each cage. Plant diversity had no effect on
   any of the grasshopper fitness measures, neither in unfertilized nor in
   fertilized plots. NPK-fertilization reduced grasshopper survival but
   increased body mass of males and reproductive success of the surviving
   females. Fertilization effects were not mediated by plant community
   structure, productivity or composition, suggesting that higher food
   plant quality was one of the main drivers. There was no interaction
   between plant diversity and fertilization on any of the measures. In
   conclusion, an increase in eutrophication, in both species-rich and
   species-poor grasslands, could lead to higher reproductive success and
   therefore higher abundances of herbivorous insects including insect
   pests, with fertilization effects dominating plant diversity effects.}},

Title = {{Meta-analysis of the effects of small mammal disturbances on species

Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{289-299}},

Abstract = {{The disturbance activities of many small mammals, including building
   burrows, mounds, trails and tunnels, and herbivory, can have significant
   impacts on their ecosystems, both through trophic and non-trophic
   interactions. Some species have large enough impacts through their
   disturbances to be classed as ecosystem engineers and/or keystone
   species. Others have negative or null effects. However, at present it is
   difficult to predict whether the disturbances created by a given species
   will have significant effects on common measures of ecosystem response
   such as species richness, diversity and biomass. We ask whether
   variables characterizing disturbance type, responding species,
   disturbance-making species and the environment can predict changes in
   magnitude and direction of effects on biomass, richness and diversity.
   We test these predictions with a meta-analysis of 106 data entries in a
   database derived from 63 papers, representing 40 small mammal species.
   We find that small mammal disturbances in general increase biomass, and
   both increase and decrease richness and diversity. We also identify
   individual environmental, disturbance-related, and species-related
   variables associated with these changes in magnitude and direction. We
   discuss the likely interactions between these variables, and how current
   proxy measures of disturbance impact could be replaced by more accurate
   direct measures. We recommend that future studies focus on conditions
   characterized by combinations of variables we identify as significant,
   in order to understand how these variable interactions (which cannot be
   analysed through meta-analysis) affect disturbance outcomes. Based on
   the gaps in our database and results, we also recommend that future
   studies directly measure disturbance impact, measure disturbance effects
   on animal and well as plant taxa, and take measurements on multiple
   scales.}},

Abstract = {{The faeces of large herbivores include viable seeds of many plant
   species. With dung decomposition, some seeds migrate into the soil and
   influence seed bank build-up. However, only a few papers report evidence
   of this process, and only from grasslands. In forest studies, this
   subject has so far been neglected. Therefore, I ask in this paper
   whether seeds present in the dung of European bison migrate to the
   forest soil seed bank and influence its build-up. I sampled soil from
   underneath European bison dung pats and from surrounding areas (control
   samples). Samples were divided into shallow (0-5 cm) and deep (5-10 cm)
   series. Soil seed bank content was studied in the greenhouse for 2
   years. The shallow seed bank under dung pats was characterized by the
   highest species richness (49 species) and seed density (> 2,000 m(-2)).
   Urtica dioica, Juncus effusus and Carex remota showed a demonstrable
   increase in seed density in the shallow seed bank underneath dung. Three
   years after dung deposition, seeds of endozoochoric origin influenced
   the soil seed bank of coniferous forest. U. dioica, J. effusus, C.
   remota and other species of deciduous forests and grasslands (Agrostis
   capillaris, Milium effusum, Polygonum hydropiper, Polygonum mite,
   Scrophularia nodosa, Stachys sylvatica, Veronica chamaedrys) caused an
   increase in seed density (by 61 \%) and species richness (by 33 \%) of
   the shallow soil seed bank underneath dung in comparison with the
   control soil seed bank.}},

Abstract = {{Because the indigenous burrowing lagomorph plateau pika (Ochotona
   curzoniae) is considered to have negative ecological impacts on alpine
   meadow steppe grasslands of the Headwaters Region of the Yellow, Yangtze
   and Mekong Rivers we investigated its effects on ecosystem productivity
   and soil properties, and especially net ecosystem carbon flux.
   We measured net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and its components gross
   ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) at peak
   aboveground biomass by the chamber method with reference to plant and
   soil characteristics of areas of alpine meadow steppe with different
   densities of pika burrows.
   Higher burrow density decreased NEE, GEP and ER. Above-ground biomass,
   species number, plant cover and leaf area index decreased with
   increasing pika density. Higher burrow density was associated with lower
   soil moisture and higher soil temperature. Responses of NEE were related
   to changes of abiotic and biotic factors affecting its two components.
   NEE was positively related to soil moisture, soil ammonium nitrogen,
   plant cover, leaf area index and above-ground biomass but was negatively
   correlated with higher soil nitrate nitrogen.
   Decrease of NEE by plateau pika may reduce the carbon sink balance of
   Qinghai-Tibet plateau grassland. Such effects may be influenced by
   grazing pressure from domestic livestock, population levels of natural
   predators, and climate change.}},

Abstract = {{In the alpine summer-grazing area, grazing intensity is one of the most
   important management variables controlling vegetation and ecosystem
   services. In spite of this, grazing intensity is difficult to quantify
   on large, heterogeneous alpine pastures. For this reason, local grazing
   intensity on two alpine summer dairy farms in the canton of Obwalden and
   in the Lower Engadine, Switzerland, were quantified by means of GPS
   tracking. The two farms differed in terms of environmental conditions
   and grazing management. Local grazing intensity on both farms was
   strongly determined by natural conditions such as slope of the terrain,
   forage quality, and distance to sheds and water sources. An effect of
   grazing management on local grazing intensity was only detectable on the
   farm where strict rotational grazing is practised. On this farm, a
   negative correlation was also found between grazing intensity and plant
   species richness. By contrast, ecosystem services on the summer-grazing
   farm with large pasture plots and free-range grazing were largely
   determined by environmental conditions and pasture management. This
   shows that strict grazing management is necessary in order to control
   the provision of ecosystem services on summer-grazing pastures via
   grazing intensity.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated effects of farming practice scenarios aiming to
   reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and subsequent alternative land
   use on environmental impacts of a beef cattle production system using
   the life cycle assessment approach. The baseline scenario includes a
   standard cow-calf herd with finishing heifers based on grazing, and a
   standard bull-fattening herd using a diet mainly based on maize silage,
   corresponding to current farm characteristics and management by beef
   farmers in France. Alternative scenarios were developed with changes in
   farming practices. Some scenarios modified grassland management (S1:
   decreasing mineral N fertiliser on permanent grassland; S2: decreasing
   grass losses during grazing) or herd management (S3: underfeeding of
   heifers in winter; S4: fattening female calves instead of being reared
   at a moderate growth rate; S5: increasing longevity of cows from 7 to 9
   years; S6: advancing first calving age from 3 to 2 years). Other
   scenarios replaced protein sources (S7: partially replacing a protein
   supplement by lucerne hay for the cow-calf herd; S8: replacing soya bean
   meal with rapeseed meal for the fattening herd) or increased n-3 fatty
   acid content using extruded linseed (S9). The combination of compatible
   scenarios S1, S2, S5, S6 and S8 was also studied (S10). The impacts,
   such as climate change (CC, not including CO2 emissions/sequestration of
   land use and land-use change, LULUC), CC/LULUC (including CO2 emissions
   of LULUC), cumulative energy demand, eutrophication (EP), acidification
   and land occupation (LO) were expressed per kg of carcass mass and per
   ha of land occupied. Compared with the baseline, the most promising
   practice to reduce impacts per kg carcass mass was S10 (all reduced by
   13\% to 28\%), followed by S6 (by 8\% to 10\%). For other scenarios,
   impact reduction did not exceed 5\%, except for EP (up to 11\%) and LO
   (up to 10\%). Effects of changes in farming practices (the scenarios) on
   environmental impacts varied according to impact category and functional
   unit. For some scenarios (S2, S4, S6 and S10), permanent grassland area
   and LO per kg of carcass decreased by 12\% to 23\% and 9\% to 19\%,
   respectively. If the `excess' permanent grassland was converted to
   fast-growing conifer forest to sequester carbon in tree and soil
   biomass, CC/LULUC per kg of carcass could be reduced by 20\%, 25\%, 27\%
   and 48\% for scenarios S2, S4, S6 and S10, respectively. These results
   illustrate the potential of farming practices and forest as an
   alternative land use to contribute to short-and mid-term GHG mitigation
   of beef cattle production systems.}},

Abstract = {{Plant community functional structure may drive ecosystem functions in
   relation with (i) the trait values characterizing dominant species,
   according to the ``biomass ratio hypothesis{''} proposed by Grime, and
   (ii) thanks to trait dissimilarity among species, according to the
   ``diversity hypothesis{''} proposed by Tilman. Both propositions have
   already yielded support but their relative importance and how they
   impact biomass production in field situations is still not well known.
   This study therefore tested (i) whether or not there was a close
   relationship between biomass production and the community-weighted mean
   trait values (CWM), as expected from the ``biomass ratio hypothesis{''},
   and (ii) the impact of the functional diversity (FDQ) on biomass
   production, which is expected to be positive according to the
   ``diversity-hypothesis{''}. The study considered a range of plant
   assemblages occurring in a wet grassland and five above-ground and four
   below-ground plant traits were measured to characterize their functional
   structure. The effects of species diversity, soil water content, soil
   nitrogen availability and grazing intensity on biomass production were
   also determined.
   We showed that biomass production was not related either to species
   richness and diversity or to any of the resource and disturbance
   parameters considered. Conversely, the functional structure was found to
   explain up to 55\% of the variability of the biomass production. The
   results obtained clearly supported the ``biomass-ratio hypothesis{''}.
   Functional diversity was mainly found to negatively impact biomass
   production with only poor support to the ``diversity hypothesis{''}. We
   suggest that such a dilution effect of increasing FDQ on community
   primary production may be typical of fertile habitats.
   In order to significantly improve our understanding of the relationship
   between functional diversity and ecosystem processes, further studies
   should consider plant assemblages that have been shaped over the long
   term and habitats across a wide range of productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Machine mowing, mimicking the traditional hand mowing, is often used as
   a successful management tool to maintain grassland biodiversity, but few
   studies have investigated the long-term effects of traditional versus
   mechanical mowing of plant communities. Machine mowing as opposed to
   hand mowing causes soil compaction and reduction of soil aeration. In
   response, we expected strong effects on below-ground plant traits: root
   aerenchyma formation and superficial root growth, and no specific
   effects on aboveground traits. Effects were expected to be more
   pronounced in soils vulnerable to compaction.
   We evaluated the changes in above- and belowground plant traits in a
   long-term (38-year) experiment with annual hand-mowing and
   machine-mowing management regimes on two different soil types: a coarse
   structured sandy soil and a finer structured sandy-organic soil
   Only on the organic soil, long-term machine mowing leads to lower soil
   aeration (more compacted soil) and a marked change in the belowground
   trait distribution of the plant community. Here we find a higher cover
   of superficially rooting species and marginally significant lower cover
   of species without morphological adaptations to soil hypoxia, but no
   effect on species with a high capacity of forming aerenchyma.
   Mowing with heavy machines on soils vulnerable to compaction affect the
   vegetation according to changes in soil physical conditions. This is
   reflected in a shift towards communities with greater proportion of
   superficially rooting species. Our results illustrate the sensitivity of
   grasslands to slight changes in the management regime.}},

Abstract = {{GEMINI, a mechanistic model linking plant functional traits, plant
   populations, community dynamics, and ecosystem scale fluxes in
   grasslands has been reported in a companion paper (Soussana et al.,
   2012). For monocultures and six species mixtures of perennial grass
   species, this model has been successfully evaluated against experimental
   data of above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and plant community
   structure across nitrogen and disturbance (cutting frequency) gradients.
   The GEMINI model combines two categories of processes: (i) C and N
   fluxes, (ii) morphogenesis and architecture of roots and shoots and
   demography of clonal plant axes. These two process categories constrain
   the form and function of the simulated clonal plants within plastic
   limits. We show here that the plasticity of the simulated plant
   populations accounts for well-established empirical laws: (i) root:shoot
   ratio, (ii) self-thinning, (iii) critical shoot N content, and (iv) role
   of plant traits (specific leaf area and plant height) for population
   response to environmental gradients (nitrogen and disturbance).
   Moreover, we show that model versions for which plasticity simulation
   has been partly or fully suppressed have a reduced ANPP in monocultures
   and in binary mixtures and do not capture anymore productivity and
   dominance changes across environmental gradients. We conclude that,
   along environmental and competition gradients, the plasticity of plant
   form and function is required to maintain the coordination of multiple
   resource capture and, hence, to sustain productivity and dominance. (C)

Abstract = {{The assessment of the effects of long-term management practices is
   relevant in understanding the current patterns of plant assemblages in
   semi-natural ecosystems. We hypothesized that the variety of management
   practices across different farming systems under the same ecological
   conditions directly and indirectly shapes these patterns via the
   long-term changes induced in soil features. The aims of this paper were
   to evaluate the influence of two sets of variables describing long-term
   management practices and soil features on plant assemblages and their
   importance in the context of Mediterranean silvo-pastoral systems. The
   analysis of variance revealed that richness and grazing value were not
   affected at all by grazing livestock species and soil tillage frequency
   and that they both showed relatively high absolute values for the
   specific context under study. Trifolium subterraneum was a key species
   in contributing to grassland grazing value and habitat biodiversity. The
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis highlighted the influence of
   management practices and soil features on plant assemblage composition,
   which was significantly affected by grazing livestock species and
   stocking rate and by soil pH and K content. The Redundancy Analysis
   showed that soil pH and related features were in turn affected by
   stocking rate, supporting our hypothesis that management practices
   influenced plant assemblage composition directly and indirectly via
   their long-term effects on soil features. The results also highlighted
   that a systemic analytical perspective applied at a grazing system scale
   can be effective in addressing sustainable grassland management issues
   in Mediterranean silvo-pastoral systems.}},

Abstract = {{The eastern Himalayan region of Southwest China represents the worlds
   most biodiverse temperate region as well as a cultural hotspot
   undergoing rapid cultural and ecological change. This area represents
   the center of origin for many plant groups including horticulturally
   valuable species of Pedicularis, Rhododendron and Primula. Alpine
   meadows here also provide summer pastures for Tibetan yak herders and
   the source for important medicinal plants. Stocking levels for livestock
   here have quadrupled over the last five decades and shrubs are
   encroaching into many historical rangelands. Yak herders voice concerns
   over both shrub encroachment and shrinking grasslands. In this study, we
   sought to determine: (i) Are alpine rangelands in Deqin County
   overgrazed and degraded? (ii) What are the local impacts of grazing on
   plant diversity and community composition? And (iii) which environmental
   variables covary with these differences in species composition across
   the grazing gradient?
   To examine the ecological impacts of grazing in Deqin County, northwest
   Yunnan and assess its long-term sustainability, we used county records
   to determine historical population and livestock numbers, confirmed the
   results of interviews by Haynes (2011) and surveyed plant species
   richness and cover along a grazing gradient extending away from herder
   huts. Along these transects, we sampled 1m(2) quadrats at 5 m intervals,
   noting species present and percent cover for vascular plants, grasses,
   sedges, rushes, moss, lichen, exposed rock, bare ground and feces. We
   also measured the average and maximum plant height within each quadrat.
   We then computed species richness for each of the 38 transects,
   calculating alpha and beta diversities. We used one-way ANOVAs to
   compare mean species richness values and average and maximum plant
   height across grazing intensities. To chart changes in composition along
   the 100m gradient, we also plotted the percent cover of graminoid, forb,
   shrub and bare ground versus distance from the hut. We applied NMS
   ordination to relate community patterns to environmental variables and
   grazing intensity using distances to determine species groupings.
   Livestock impacts are clearly evident with proportions of grass and bare
   ground decreasing, shrubs increasing and forbs maintaining even cover
   with increasing distance from the huts. In comparison with earlier
   surveys of sites farther from huts, we found reduced plant cover and
   diversity. Plant species richness almost doubles with increasing
   distance from herder huts from 9.9 to 19.3 species per 1 m(2) quadrat.
   An ordination of species and environmental variables demonstrates that
   grazing strongly affects plant community com position across these plots
   with strong impacts on palatable plants. If herd sizes remain large and
   suitable areas for grazing continue to decline, the cumulative impacts
   of grazing appear likely to degrade the rich diversity of the region and
   reduce rangeland quality, threatening its ability to sustain current
   grazing levels.}},

Abstract = {{Humans have substantially altered the nitrogen cycle of ecosystems
   through the application of agricultural fertilizer. Fertilization may
   not only affect plant species diversity, but also insect dynamics by
   altering plant nitrogen supplies. We investigated the effect of
   experimental fertilization on the vegetation, with the ribwort plantain
   as the focal plant, and on higher trophic levels on differently managed
   grasslands throughout Germany. Over a period of 2 years, we examined two
   specialist herbivores and their parasitoid on Plantago lanceolata L.,
   and the composition and structure of the surrounding vegetation. Over 70
   sites in three geographic regions, within the large-scale project
   ``German Biodiversity Exploratories{''}, were included in the study. The
   model system consisted of the host plant P. lanceolata L., the
   monophagous weevils Mecinus labilis Herbst and M. pascuorum Gyllenhal,
   and their parasitoid Mesopolobus incultus Walker. Fertilization
   decreased plant species richness and host plant abundance, whereas it
   enhanced the total vegetation growth. The increased size and heigher
   leaf nitrogen content did not improve herbivore performance. On the
   contrary, the abundance of the two herbivores was decreased by
   fertilization. The parasitoid depended on the abundance of one of its
   hosts, M. pascuorum (positively density-dependent). Reduced herbivore
   abundance due to fertilization might be explained by a lower abundance
   of the host plant, a lower stalk number, and by changed patterns of host
   localization within higher vegetation. Fertilization negatively affected
   the third trophic level by cascading up via host abundance. The
   relationships between fertilization, surrounding vegetation and the
   tritrophic system were measured throughout the three regions and over
   the 2-year period. Our findings present consequences of intensification
   for a plant-herbivore-parasitoid system, and may have significant
   implications for the conservation of multitrophic systems in managed
   grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Colonial burrowing herbivores can modify vegetation structure, create
   belowground refugia, and generate landscape heterogeneity, thereby
   affecting the distribution and abundance of associated species.
   Black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) are such a species, and
   they may strongly affect the abundance and composition of grassland bird
   communities. We examined how prairie dog colonies in the North American
   Great Plains affect bird species and community composition. Areas
   occupied by prairie dogs, characterized by low percent cover of grass,
   high percent cover of bare soil, and low vegetation height and density,
   supported a breeding bird community that differed substantially from
   surrounding areas that lacked prairie dogs. Bird communities on colony
   sites had significantly greater densities of large-bodied carnivores
   (Burrowing Owls {[}Athene cunicularia], Mountain Plovers, {[}Charadrius
   montanus], and Killdeer {[}Charadrius vociferus]) and omnivores
   consisting of Horned Larks (Eremophila alpestris) and McCown's Longspurs
   (Rhynchophanes mccownii) than bird communities off colony sites. Bird
   communities off colony sites were dominated by small-bodied
   insectivorous sparrows (Ammodramus spp.) and omnivorous Lark Buntings
   (Calamospiza melanocorys), Vesper Sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus), and
   Lark Sparrows (Chondestes grammacus). Densities of 3 species of
   conservation concern and 1 game species were significantly higher on
   colony sites than off colony sites, and the strength of prairie dog
   effects was consistent across the northern Great Plains. Vegetation
   modification by prairie dogs sustains a diverse suite of bird species in
   these grasslands. Collectively, our findings and those from previous
   studies show that areas in the North American Great Plains with prairie
   dog colonies support higher densities of at least 9 vertebrate species
   than sites without colonies. Prairie dogs affect habitat for these
   species through multiple pathways, including creation of belowground
   refugia, supply of prey for specialized predators, modification of
   vegetation structure within colonies, and increased landscape
   heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{`Ecosystem engineers' have a critical role in the structure and function
   of natural communities and need to be considered as focal species to
   enable successful conservation or restoration of ecosystems. Through
   introduction and/or managing a single species, an entire community can
   be influenced. In our study we show that Pedicularis palustris, an
   endangered hemiparasite in large parts of Europe, can act as an
   `ecosystem engineer,' speeding up the restoration of undrained
   fen-meadow ecosystems colonised by species-poor and resistant Carex
   acuta vegetation. The parasitic behavior of Pedicularis palustris on
   tall sedges significantly alters local plant diversity, biomass
   production and soil characteristics. Our experiments show that, under
   the right hydrological conditions and mowing management practice,
   several target species for nature conservation can benefit from the gaps
   it creates in above-ground Carex acuta vegetation and its dense
   below-ground root system. The more prominent presence of mosses and
   lower density of the topsoil stimulates the recovery of mesotrophic
   transition mire with active peat formation. Since this habitat type is
   specifically protected under the European Habitat Directive,
   (re)introduction of Pedicularis palustris in similar sites within its
   geographical distribution range in Europe may be a helpful tool to
   achieve the imposed obligations for appropriate management and
   restoration. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier GmbH.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding multiple ecological determinants of plant diversity and
   composition underpins good vegetation management. In mesic ecosystems,
   ecological theory and empirical data predict that moderate to high
   disturbance promotes native plant diversity, but relationships between
   disturbance and other drivers of diversity are poorly understood. We
   examined local determinants of native plant diversity and composition
   through 12-year fire, mowing and grazing experiments in two mesic grassy
   woodland remnants in fragmented agricultural landscapes of south-eastern
   Australia. Remnants were representative of diverse woodlands, but had
   contrasting management histories. We hypothesized that (1) disturbance
   is a dominant driver of plant diversity and composition and (2) moderate
   to high disturbance promotes diversity independent of other drivers or
   disturbance agent. Contrary to our first hypothesis, rainfall explained
   an overwhelming 3160\% of variation in native plant richness and native
   forb cover (hereafter diversity), while aspects of disturbance regime
   accounted for a significant but moderate 38\%. The magnitude of
   disturbance effects was often rainfall dependent, and similar to that of
   other local determinants such as spatial heterogeneity. Disturbance also
   influenced native forb composition at one site. The direction of
   disturbance effects on diversity did not depend on disturbance agent,
   but differed markedly between sites in accordance with their management
   history. At the cleared site with a history of frequent burning,
   diversity declined significantly with time since burning or mowing. By
   contrast, at the long-unburnt, wooded site, diversity declined with
   frequent fire and with lagomorph and macropod grazing. These contrasting
   responses indicate that moderate to high disturbance is not consistently
   beneficial for diversity in mesic grassy ecosystems, contradicting our
   second hypothesis. Instead, disturbance responses are dependent on
   interactions with other drivers, potentially including assemblage
   filtering associated with historical fire regime and increased
   understorey productivity associated with tree clearing. Synthesis and
   applications: The magnitude and direction of disturbance effects on
   diversity depend on interactions with other drivers, hence a single
   prescription for disturbance regime across different remnants of
   fragmented grassy ecosystems is not appropriate. Decadal-scale responses
   of diversity to disturbance may be shaped by historical disturbances,
   suggesting instead that management be guided by historical regime.}},

   (mean species 15N enrichment) decreased and trophic diversity (variance
   among species in 15N enrichment) increased along the chronosequence from
   pastures to remnants. These patterns resulted from an increase in the
   richness of species with low 15N enrichment (i.e. more herbivorous'
   species) along the chronosequence, which was also reflected in increases
   in the species richness of sugar feeders. Recovery of direct-seeded
   sites lagged behind tube stock sites of the same age, suggesting a role
   for habitat structure. Species composition followed a trajectory
   suggestive of partial recovery, with revegetated sites supporting
   assemblages intermediate to pastures and remnants, but distinct from
   both. Synthesis and applications. Tree planting promotes recovery of
   species composition and trophic function. Planting method affects the
   speed of functional recovery, although minimally. Species on the
   herbivorous end of the spectrum of omnivory were slower to recover than
   more predaceous species and may require deliberate restoration of
   features associated with mature trees. Trophic guilds based on objective
   measures of diet respond more clearly to restoration than do those based
   on subjective observations and offer a more insightful method.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, Amazonian deforestation has become a question of global
   concern. Deforestation in Amazon is a complex phenomenon in nature and
   has been related to traditional agriculture expansion. In this work,
   land use, socioeconomic and conservation indicators, combined with
   statistical analysis, were used to understand forces associated with
   patterns of deforestation. This approach was applied in Southern
   Brazilian Pre-Amazon in Mato Grosso State, which represents an extensive
   rain forest-savanna ecotone, located in the south border of Amazon
   biome. Based on data from the last two agricultural censuses
   (1995/1996-2006), we compared agricultural expansion in this area and
   Mato Grosso state. Results have shown that 85 \% of state deforestation
   was concentrated in Southern Pre-Amazon and was closely related to
   increase in number of cattle and pasture area. PCA results pointed that
   population (92 \%), number of cattle (86.5 \%), pastures (84.2 \%) and
   tractors (78.4 \%) were variables with highest positive correlation to
   deforestation. It showed that GDP contributes to an individual axis and
   has a low correlation to deforestation (37.8 \%). Conservation units and
   indigenous reserves also contribute to a single axis and were negatively
   correlated to temporary crops area. Results revealed a significant
   reduction in production and commercialization of extractive products in
   the region, revealing that the main, almost only conservation policy in
   Mato Grosso remains the creation of Special Areas. We suggest that
   further studies are necessary to screen development alternatives to
   simple cutting trees down. It is important to diversify strategies for
   deforestation control, and development aspects must be more seriously
   considered to reach a sustainable deforestation control policy.}},

Abstract = {{Permanent grasslands are an important habitat for insect communities,
   including pollinator populations which are in pan-European decline.
   Here, we investigated the benefits of temporarily excluding sheep from
   pastures on butterfly (Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera and Zygaenidae) and
   bumblebee (Hymenoptera: Bombidae) communities in two semi-natural
   grasslands differing in soil fertility and surrounding landscapes. We
   compared the impact of continuous grazing against rotational grazing
   (RG) at the same stocking rate but in which a subplot was excluded from
   the rotation during the main flowering period. We predicted that the
   diversity of flower-visiting insect community would be improved by RG
   due to the preservation of flower-rich patches and the maintenance of
   sward heterogeneity. Benefits of RG management were mainly evidenced on
   bumblebee density and species richness, with some additional effects on
   local density of butterflies during the subplot-exclusion period.
   Temporarily excluding sheep from pastures during peak flowering could
   thus offer an opportunity to preserve the diversity of flower-visiting
   insects, in spite of weaker benefits than could have been expected from
   previous surveys with cattle.}},

Title = {{Plant seedlings in a species-rich meadow: effect of management,

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{286-295}},

Abstract = {{Questions (1) How do various mowing regimes used for the preservation of
   diverse meadow biota affect the occurrence of plant seedlings? (2) Does
   the effect of mowing regime on seedlings differ among vegetation types?
   (3) Are the seedlings occurring under a particular management type
   characterized by distinct functional traits? (4) Do the traits of
   seedlings differ from those of resident adult plant species? Location
   White Carpathians (Bile Karpaty) Mountains, Czech Republic. Methods In a
   species-rich meadow, seedlings (non-graminoids only) were identified to
   species and counted in an experiment that included management cessation
   and five mowing regimes in three types of vegetation for 2yr. The
   abundance-weighted averages of functional traits were compared between
   seedling and adult plant communities. Results Seedling occurrence was
   suppressed by management cessation (abandonment) but differences among
   the five mowing treatments were small for all vegetation types. Seedling
   density and species richness were highest in vegetation dominated by
   Bromus erectus, intermediate in vegetation dominated by Molinia
   arundinacea, and lowest in vegetation dominated by Calamagrostis
   epigejos. Comparison of functional trait composition of seedlings with
   that of adult plants revealed that seedlings were largely produced by
   species with no or limited clonal growth and with low stature, and
   therefore with lower competitive ability. Conclusions The results
   indicate that short-term alteration of the mowing regime does not change
   conditions conducive to seedling occurrence, but even short-term
   abandonment hinders the establishment of small, non-clonal species.
   Rapid changes in species composition after abandonment in temperate
   meadows are therefore due not only to competitive exclusion of
   subordinate plant species, but also to their inability to establish from
   seeds.}},

Journal = {{ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{48}},
Pages = {{62-68}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Current studies on trophic interactions in biodiversity experiments have
   largely relied on artificially sown gradients in plant diversity, but
   removal experiments with their more natural plant community composition
   are more realistic. Slugs are a major part of the invertebrate herbivore
   community, with some species being common pests in agriculture. We
   therefore investigated how strongly slugs are influenced by grassland
   management, plant biodiversity and composition. Here we analysed the
   effects of cutting frequency, fertilizer application and plant
   functional group composition on slug densities and their contribution to
   herbivory on Rumex acetosa in a removal experiment within a >100-year
   old grassland in Northern Germany. The experiment was laid out as a
   Latin rectangle with full factorial combinations of (i) plant functional
   group removal (3 levels) using herbicides, (ii) fertilizer application
   (2 levels) and (iii) cutting frequency (2 levels). The resulting 12
   treatment combinations were replicated 6 times, resulting in 72 plots.
   We collected a total of 1020 individuals belonging to three species Anon
   distinctus (60.4\% of individuals), Deroceras reticulatum (34.7\%) and
   Anion lusitanicus (4.9\%) using a cover board technique and additionally
   measured herbivore damage to R. acetosa. We found the highest slug
   abundance on plots with a low cutting frequency and high food resource
   availability (increased cover of forbs and taller vegetation).
   Fertilizer application had no significant effect on slug abundance, but
   caused higher herbivore damage to on R. acetosa, possibly as a result of
   increased tissue quality. The negative effect of higher cutting
   frequency on slug abundance was lowest in control plots with their
   naturally developed graminoid-forb communities (cutting reduced slug
   density by 6\% in the control vs. 29\% in herbicide plots). Our
   experiments therefore support the idea that more natural plant species
   compositions reduce the impact of disturbances (e.g. through cutting or
   grazing) on invertebrates. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Aim Climate and habitat management are two key drivers for patterns of
   biodiversity, but little is known about relative importance,
   interactions and nonlinear effects of climate and management on species
   richness and trait variation of plants. Location Alps (Germany). Methods
   We studied patterns of species richness and pollination types in 34
   alpine grasslands along an altitudinal climatic gradient comparing
   grazed, mown and non-managed grasslands. Two vegetation assessments were
   conducted in 2009 on ten 4-m2 plots per study site and per survey.
   Results In total, 484 vascular plant species were recorded. Species
   richness peaked at intermediate temperatures and was highest in grazed
   grasslands compared with mown and non-managed grasslands. No significant
   interaction between management effects and climate was found. Species
   richness of insect-pollinated plants peaked at lower temperatures
   (higher altitudes) than species richness of wind-pollinated plant
   species. The proportion of wind-pollinated plants decreased with
   decreasing temperature, but the vegetation cover of wind-pollinated
   plants increased with decreasing temperature. Main conclusions Our
   results indicate that managing alpine grasslands by extensive grazing
   maintains high plant diversity over the full subalpine gradient. Rising
   temperatures with climate change and an upward shift of the diversity
   peak of plants might result not only in reduced overall diversity
   because of reduced grassland area at higher altitudes but also in
   changed species composition and adaptive potential of pollination types.}},

Abstract = {{Plant growth can be limited by resource acquisition and defence against
   consumers, leading to contrasting trade-off possibilities. The
   competition-defence hypothesis posits a trade-off between competitive
   ability and defence against enemies (e.g. herbivores and pathogens). The
   growth-defence hypothesis suggests that strong competitors for nutrients
   are also defended against enemies, at a cost to growth rate. We tested
   these hypotheses using observations of 706 plant populations of over 500
   species before and following identical fertilisation and fencing
   treatments at 39 grassland sites worldwide. Strong positive covariance
   in species responses to both treatments provided support for a
   growth-defence trade-off: populations that increased with the removal of
   nutrient limitation (poor competitors) also increased following removal
   of consumers. This result held globally across 4years within plant
   life-history groups and within the majority of individual sites. Thus, a
   growth-defence trade-off appears to be the norm, and mechanisms
   maintaining grassland biodiversity may operate within this constraint.}},

Abstract = {{Calcareous grasslands are among the most species-rich habitats in
   Europe, but are increasingly threatened due to abandonment and
   fragmentation. Little is known about how the surrounding landscape
   influences fragmentation effects. Here, we focus on the interaction
   between habitat fragmentation and landscape composition on leafhoppers,
   a highly diverse group of insects, including many species that are
   likely to be vulnerable to changes in their environment. We selected 14
   small and 14 large fragments of calcareous grassland in Central Germany,
   differing in isolation from other calcareous grasslands and in
   composition of the surrounding landscape. Leafhoppers, sampled by sweep
   netting, were either specialists that depended on calcareous grasslands
   or generalists that could use the landscape matrix, but still required
   low-productivity habitats. Increasing habitat isolation reduced
   leafhopper species richness in simple (dominated by arable crops), but
   not in complex landscapes. This effect was driven by the generalist
   species. In simple landscapes, leafhoppers may find it more difficult to
   reach the next suitable fragment due to a lack of alternative resources
   during dispersal. Moreover, we found that generalist species richness
   increased with increasing connectivity on small fragments, whereas it
   remained stable with increasing connectivity on large fragments. In
   small, isolated fragments, a higher extinction rate combined with a
   lower probability of recolonization is thought to cause the reduced
   species richness. Synthesis and applications. Our results show for the
   first time that insect species richness can be negatively affected by
   increasing habitat isolation in simplified but not in complex landscapes
   and in small but not in large fragments. We provide evidence that
   mitigating the negative effects of habitat fragmentation needs to take
   the surrounding landscape into account. Management efforts should
   prioritize (i) an increase in connectivity of small, isolated fragments,
   (ii) an increase in connectivity of fragments in simple landscapes and
   (iii) enhanced dispersal by increasing heterogeneity of both landscape
   composition and configuration. Moreover, extensive management of
   fragments by grazing or mowing to increase local habitat quality for
   leafhoppers would benefit other insect groups as well.}},

Abstract = {{Alpine pastures are typical examples of ``high nature value
   farmlands{''}, representing important habitats harbouring unique
   biological communities. Disturbance induced by overgrazing influences
   significantly ecosystem processes, in which invertebrates play a major
   role. To develop new models of sustainable management of pastures, more
   knowledge is needed of the animal communities, essential to the
   ecological functioning of pasture ecosystems. The apparent poor
   ecological state of several pastures in the Natural Regional Park of
   Alpi Marittime (NW-Italy) lead us to evaluate the influence of grazing
   history on biodiversity, using spider and harvestmen assemblages as key
   groups. Four different pastoral types characterized by four different
   grazing histories were identified using the Daget-Poissonet method.
   Spiders and harvestmen were collected by means of pitfall traps.
   Arachnid assemblages were characterized in terms of composition,
   abundance, species richness, richness of endemic species and taxonomic
   relatedness. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to test
   differences among assemblages occurring in each pastoral type.
   Furthermore, we tested differences in terms of plant communities
   (species richness and percentage of zoogenic species). Specificity and
   fidelity of every spider and harvestmen species within pastoral types
   were explored by the IndVal (Indicator Value) procedure. Fifty-eight
   species of spiders and seven species of harvestmen were collected (2,304
   individuals). Pastoral types related to intensive grazing were
   characterized by the dominance of diurnal wanderer spiders (namely
   Lycosidae) while, conversely, nocturnal wanderers (mainly Gnaphosidae)
   were more abundant in extensive pastoral types. Results show that both
   species richness and spider abundance were higher in abandoned areas of
   extensive grazing, while endemic assemblages were richer in extensive
   grazed areas, which also hosted the most diverse plant community.
   Furthermore, most of the indicator species of spiders of this type were
   endemic, characterized by more demanding ecological requirements.}},

Journal = {{NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{130-138}},

Abstract = {{We studied responses of breeding birds to alternative regimes for
   managing tallgrass prairie at the Smoky Hill Air National Guard Range in
   central Kansas. Species richness, diversity, and evenness did not differ
   among treatments, but overall abundance was highest in unburned idle
   (i.e., not grazed or hayed) transects, and was lowest in idle transects
   burned that spring. However, no treatment was either superior or
   inferior to all others for attracting the highest numbers of every
   species. Dickcissels (Spiza americana) and Henlow's sparrows (Ammodramus
   henslowii) were most numerous in unburned idle units, grasshopper
   sparrows (A. savannarum) were most abundant in grazed units and hayed
   units, upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) were most often found in
   burned units, whereas eastern meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) were less
   abundant in burned units than in all other treatments. We conclude that
   the recent switch to burning idle units every 3-4 years, rather than
   annually, has benefitted most grassland bird species. The variety of
   management regimes implemented at Smoky Hill Air National Guard Range
   fosters heterogeneity of vegetative structure across the landscape, and
   thereby allows the site to provide for differing needs of various
   species, thus enhancing its value for grassland bird conservation.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we inquire into the effects of short-term goat grazing
   abandonment on plant species and functional composition, bare ground and
   net primary productivity (NPP) in two traditionally grazed pastures
   located in the Canarian Network of Natural Protected Areas and the
   Natura 2000 Network. In addition, we analyse soil chemical properties,
   biomass tannin content and energetic value to find out how grazing
   abandonment affects soil fertility and forage quality of these
   agroecosystems. Grazing exclusion effects on plant species and
   functional composition, as well as on soil fertility depended on the
   productivity of the studied pasture. Erect forbs and shrubs (endemic to
   Macaronesian region and native) were favoured by grazing removal in the
   most productive pasture, while soil fertility decreased in the driest
   and least productive site. An increase in NPP after exclusion was
   consistent among study sites. Although we consider goat grazing as
   necessary for maintaining traditional agroecosystems, we also suggest
   controlling it over time, allowing some periods of rest to give endemic
   shrub species time to recover from near propagule sources.}},

Title = {{Biodiversity Effects on Plant Stoichiometry}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{In the course of the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning debate, the
   issue of multifunctionality of species communities has recently become a
   major focus. Elemental stoichiometry is related to a variety of
   processes reflecting multiple plant responses to the biotic and abiotic
   environment. It can thus be expected that the diversity of a plant
   assemblage alters community level plant tissue chemistry. We explored
   elemental stoichiometry in aboveground plant tissue (ratios of carbon,
   nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and its relationship to plant
   diversity in a 5-year study in a large grassland biodiversity experiment
   (Jena Experiment). Species richness and functional group richness
   affected community stoichiometry, especially by increasing C:P and N:P
   ratios. The primacy of either species or functional group richness
   effects depended on the sequence of testing these terms, indicating that
   both aspects of richness were congruent and complementary to expected
   strong effects of legume presence and grass presence on plant chemical
   composition. Legumes and grasses had antagonistic effects on C:N
   (-27.7\% in the presence of legumes, +32.7\% in the presence of
   grasses). In addition to diversity effects on mean ratios, higher
   species richness consistently decreased the variance of chemical
   composition for all elemental ratios. The diversity effects on plant
   stoichiometry has several non-exclusive explanations:The reduction in
   variance can reflect a statistical averaging effect of species with
   different chemical composition or a optimization of nutrient uptake at
   high diversity, leading to converging ratios at high diversity. The
   shifts in mean ratios potentially reflect higher allocation to stem
   tissue as plants grew taller at higher richness. By showing a first link
   between plant diversity and stoichiometry in a multiyear experiment, our
   results indicate that losing plant species from grassland ecosystems
   will lead to less reliable chemical composition of forage for
   herbivorous consumers and belowground litter input.}},

Title = {{Diversity and distribution of grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acridoidea) in
   grasslands of the Southern Pampas region, Argentina}},

Abstract = {{In Argentina, the grasslands of Pampas region comprise approximately
   15\% of the country. As in other grasslands of the world, grasshoppers
   are among the most important native herbivores. Their economic
   importance has been recognized in Argentina since the mid to late
   nineteenth century, since outbreaks of different species have become
   recurrent phenomena. Therefore, the main objective of this work was to
   study their diversity and distribution in grasslands of the Southern
   Pampas region (Laprida county, Buenos Aires province), as one of the
   most affected areas. The study was conducted during five seasons
   (2005-10). Sampling sites were represented by the most common plant
   communities in this area, classified in four categories: native
   grasslands, disturbed grasslands, implanted pastures and halophilous
   grasslands. The samplings were conducted from mid-spring to early
   autumn, with five or six samples per season. We estimated the following
   population descriptors: species richness (S), eveness (E), dominance
   (J), and diversity index (H'). In order to evaluate the similitude of
   the grasshopper communities present in the different plant communities,
   we used qualitative and quantitative coefficients of similitude. A total
   of 22 species of grasshoppers were collected, of which 21 belong to the
   family Acrididae. The subfamily Melanoplinae was the most diverse with
   eight species. The largest species richness was recorded in native
   grasslands (18). The different communities of grasshoppers had similar
   indices of evenness and dominance (p>0.05). Considering all plant
   communities, the average value of Shannon-Wiener index was 1.58 +/-
   0.075. There was a positive correlation between evenness index and
   species richness (p<0.05). The diversity index H' was different between
   plants communities (p<0.05), and it was higher in the disturbed
   grassland (1.75 +/- 0.096, p<0.05) than in the halophilous grasslands
   (1.34 +/- 0.12). Native and disturbed grasslands had a higher plant
   richness than halophilous grasslands and implanted pastures (p<0.05).
   There was a positive relationship between plant richness and
   grasshoppers species richness, and diversity of grasshoppers. According
   to the qualitative indices applied, the similitude between different
   grasshopper communities was higher than 60\%. In general, the species
   that had a higher frequency of occurrence showed greater abundance and
   distribution. Covasacris pallidinota, Dichroplus elongatus, D.
   maculipennis, Borellia bruneri and B. pallida were the most widely
   distributed species, most of them (12) showed a restricted distribution
   and few (five) an intermediate distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance in habitat complexity and niche availability affect
   competitive interactions between faunal species which may result in
   their extinction. This study was conducted to assess the conservation
   value of four a priori selected sites, A: `minimally disturbed natural
   forest patch', B: `herbaceous grassland patch', C: `road verge patch'
   and D: `highly disturbed natural forest patch' using epigaeic
   invertebrate assemblages in Silaka Nature Reserve. A total of 2415
   specimens belonging to three phyla (Arthropoda, Mollusca and Annelida)
   were caught from all sites using pitfall traps, and these were sorted
   into 14 orders, 15 families, 21 species and 17 morphospecies.
   Multivariate approaches using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA)
   showed that some measured site variables, e.g. litter depth, grazing
   intensity, soil pH, soil phosphorus content and texture (percentage clay
   and silt) accounted for species distribution trends across sites. Site A
   had both common/widespread and rare/typical invertebrate taxa, and
   therefore was of high value for conserving invertebrate biotic
   communities within the reserve. The other three sites also offered
   optimal and unique habitat requirements for protecting and preserving
   species such as Ancylotrypha zuluensis, Lycosidae sp. 2, and the
   Opiliones. Biotope management in the reserve should therefore aim at
   preserving a variety of habitat patches that differ in structural and
   compositional vegetation. Furthermore, anthropogenic pressures resulting
   from frequent clearing should be regulated especially during the summer
   to cater for various developmental (including immature) stages of the
   invertebrate assemblage of the reserve.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{148-157}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Little is known of the impact of roads on insect mortality. This is a
   significant gap, because road verges are regarded as an important tool
   for insect conservation. In this study, we investigated which factors
   affect the number of roadkills in grassland butterflies and,
   simultaneously, the species composition and abundance on road verges. We
   established sixty transects, two hundred metres long, on roads in
   farmland areas and with differing traffic volume. Each transect
   consisted of two parallel lines, one on either side of the road.
   Ordination methods showed that the species composition of the
   butterflies killed on the roads was primarily explained by the species
   composition of those living on the road verges. At least 6.8\% of the
   butterflies were estimated to end up roadkilled. Also, the number of
   species and abundance of butterflies killed on the roads were positively
   dependent on both the abundance of butterflies on the road verges and on
   the traffic volume, but negatively correlated with the richness of plant
   species on the road verges. However, the proportion of individuals
   killed was negatively linked with the abundance of butterflies on the
   road verges, the richness of the plant species and the share of
   grassland in the landscape. There was a statistically significant
   tendency for small-bodied species to be overrepresented in the roadkill
   samples. Our results indicate that the verges which were of high
   conservation value for butterflies suffered the least from road
   mortality. The sowing of plant species, less frequent mowing and
   maintaining a high grassland cover in the vicinity of roads are
   recommended conservation actions for the improved conservation value of
   road verges for butterflies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Establishment of rare flood meadow species by plant material transfer:
   Experimental tests of threshold amounts and the effect of sowing
   position}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{222-229}},

Abstract = {{The transfer of freshly cut seed-containing plant material is a widely
   applied method to re-establish grassland of high biodiversity. Still,
   the amount of plant material applied varies greatly across restoration
   projects. Therefore, we set up a two-year common garden experiment where
   we assessed the effect of plant material amount (0, 400, 800, 1600, 3200
   g m(-2)) and relative seed position (on top and beneath a litter layer)
   on seedling establishment, seedling fate and seedling fitness of eight
   target species for restoration of alluvial meadows.
   Most seedlings (85.6\%) emerged within the first year. Cumulative
   seedling emergence and final seedling establishment across all species
   were highest on control plots and low litter plots but were very low or
   failed completely, at 1600 and 3200 g m(-2), respectively. In general,
   large-seeded species were significantly more successful than smaller
   seeded species. Relative seed position had only a small impact on
   seedling emergence and establishment but was decisive for seedling
   survival at high litter quantities. Across all species, seedlings that
   died had a significantly lower relative height than surviving seedlings.
   Interestingly, co-occurring resident grassland vegetation had a neutral
   rather than negative impact on the response variables.
   Our results suggest an upper threshold of 1000 g m(-2) for the amount of
   plant material applied in grassland restoration, since higher amounts
   will inhibit seedling establishment. The prompt emergence of most
   seedlings during the first vegetation period highlights the importance
   of creating optimal conditions for seedling establishment already in the
   early phase of vegetation development on restoration sites. (C) 2012

Volume = {{159}},
Pages = {{396-404}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{During the past 150 years traditional forest management practices have
   been neglected in most parts of Central Europe with severe consequences
   for biodiversity. Coppicing has in the past been one of the most
   important forms of management for broadleaved woodlands. To investigate
   the effects of coppicing, we analyzed species richness and density of
   butterfly communities in coppiced woodlands with standards in the French
   Alsace. We sampled butterflies and environmental parameters through
   standardized transect walks (n = 37 plots) in five different
   successional stages (first-year, second-year, fringe, shrub and wood
   stage). With 36 butterfly species in total, among them 13 threatened
   species, coppice woodlands had a comparatively high species richness.
   Butterflies showed a clear response to coppicing, with each successional
   stage harboring a unique assemblage. However, species richness and
   densities of resident and threatened species were highest in early and
   mid-successional stages (second year and fringe stage) and lowest in the
   latest successional stage (wood). The pattern was slightly different for
   migratory species. Species richness and densities decreased along the
   successional gradient from the first-year to the wood stage. Warm
   microclimatic conditions (all groups), the availability of nectar
   resources (migratory species) and sufficient host-plants growing under
   suitable conditions (resident and threatened species) were associated
   with higher densities and greater diversity of butterflies. Based on our
   results, maintenance and expansion of coppice management should be a
   suitable tool to counteract the general decline of woodland butterflies
   and the loss of early-successional species in woodlands. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Understanding temporal effects of fire frequency on plant species
   diversity and vegetation structure is critical for managing tallgrass
   prairie (TGP), which occupies a mid-continental longitudinal
   precipitation and productivity gradient. Eastern TGP has contributed
   little information toward understanding whether vegetation-fire
   interactions are uniform or change across this biome. We resampled 34
   fire-managed mid-and late-successional ungrazed TGP remnants occurring
   across a dry to wet-mesic moisture gradient in the Chicago region of
   Illinois, USA. We compared hypotheses that burning acts either as a
   stabilizing force or causes change in diversity and structure, depending
   upon fire frequency and successional stage. Based on western TGP, we
   expected a unimodal species richness distribution across a
   cover-productivity gradient, variable functional group responses to fire
   frequency, and a negative relationship between fire frequency and
   species richness. Species diversity was unimodal across the cover
   gradient and was more strongly humpbacked in stands with greater fire
   frequency. In support of a stabilizing hypothesis, temporal similarity
   of late-successional vegetation had a logarithmic relationship with
   increasing fire frequency, while richness and evenness remained stable.
   Temporal similarity within mid-successional stands was not correlated
   with fire frequency, while richness increased and evenness decreased
   over time. Functional group responses to fire frequency were variable.
   Summer forb richness increased under high fire frequency, while C-4
   grasses, spring forbs, and nitrogen-fixing species decreased with fire
   exclusion. On mesic and wet-mesic sites, vegetation structure measured
   by the ratio of woody to graminoid species was negatively correlated
   with abundance of forbs and with fire frequency. Our findings that
   species richness responds unimodally to an environmental-productivity
   gradient, and that fire exclusion increases woody vegetation and leads
   to loss of C-4 and N-fixing species, suggest that these processes are
   uniform across the TGP biome and not affected by its
   rainfall-productivity gradient. However, increasing fire frequency in
   eastern TGP appears to increase richness of summer forbs and stabilize
   late-successional vegetation in the absence of grazing, and these
   processes may differ across the longitudinal axis of TGP. Managing
   species diversity in ungrazed eastern TGP may be dependent upon high
   fire frequency that removes woody vegetation and prevents biomass
   accumulation.}},

Abstract = {{Forest fragmentation can alter herbivory on tree recruits with possible
   consequences for regeneration. We assessed effects of forest-fragment
   quality (tree diversity, vegetation complexity, relative abundance of
   pioneer trees) and matrix habitat onarthropods and herbivory in
   KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. We compared arthropod abundances and
   herbivory on woody seedlings and saplings among four forest-fragment
   types differing in size and matrix (large fragments and small fragments
   surrounded by natural grassland, eucalypt and sugarcane plantations;
   n(plots) = 24) using analyses of covariance. We recorded 3385 arthropods
   and inspected 897 seedlings (71 species) and 876 saplings (91 species).
   Relative abundance of predators increased with fragment quality; that of
   herbivores decreased. Herbivory responses to fragment quality varied:
   seedling herbivory decreased with relative abundance of pioneers and
   sapling herbivory increased with vegetation complexity. Matrix effects
   were low with little variation in relative abundance of predators
   (0.39-0.53) and herbivores (0.22-0.32), proportion of seedling
   (8.3-11.0\%) and sapling herbivory (12.4-14.3\%) among the
   forest-fragment types. These findings indicate that herbivory on tree
   recruits is mediated by forest-fragment quality rather than matrix
   habitat. Future studies should evaluate whether contrasting effects of
   fragment quality on arthropods and herbivory are caused by weak trophic
   interactions and variable herbivore compositions.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural calcareous grasslands (alvars) are biodiversity hotspots in
   Northern Europe, particularly for herb layer plants. In the last
   century, traditional management has ceased, and the area of grasslands
   has declined due to extensive encroachment. We were interested in the
   drivers of ground layer (alias terricolous or epigeic) lichen
   communities. Our survey consisted of 86 habitat fragments in western
   Estonia, covering four types of historic alvar grasslands and three
   types of alvar-like habitats. We found that the ground lichen
   communities were primarily soil-type-specific, but were also affected by
   historic disturbances and land use change. In contrast to knowledge
   about herb layer communities, for which shrub encroachment has been
   shown to be main driver, the increased density of the herb layer and the
   reduced diversity of microhabitats were major drivers for the ground
   layer lichen community. These drivers caused a decrease in species
   richness, but only within the species of conservation value, and also
   led to a shift in the composition of lichen growth form from the
   dominance of squamulose and crustose towards fruticose lichens. We
   conclude that the traditional practice of restoring alvars by cutting
   shrubs is insufficient to maintain ground layer lichen biodiversity.
   Alvar maintenance practices should include grazing, which creates
   various small-scale ground disturbances and increases microhabitat
   heterogeneity. Alvar-like habitats originating from large-scale historic
   disturbances appeared to be suitable for calcicolous epigeic lichens,
   and can therefore be considered to be temporary substitution habitats,
   i.e. refugia for the regional species pool.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean Sea, as well as in other parts of the word, intense
   bottom trawling threatens deep and mesophotic assemblages, compromising
   mainly the survivorship of erect organisms and of the habitat complexity
   they shape. Protection of species able to affect their habitats, by
   increasing spatial complexity and enhancing interspecific interactions,
   is crucial for biodiversity conservation. It is urgent to highlight the
   occurrence of those species which act as ecosystem engineers and/or
   habitat former to enhance awareness on their ecological role and to
   develop focused conservation strategies. Lytocarpia myriophyllum is the
   largest Leptomedusan hydroid of the Mediterranean Sea, with colonies up
   to 1 m high, and the most abundant Aglaopheniid in the eastern part of
   the North Atlantic Ocean. This species creates wide forests on soft
   bottoms stabilizing sediments, providing refuge and food for several
   other associated organisms and could be defined both a habitat former
   and an ecosystem engineer. Thanks to trimix diving here we report on new
   insights on the morphological, biological and ecological features of L.
   myriophyllum meadows from the Mediterranean Sea furnishing a baseline
   for protection plans focused on these facies. This work demonstrates
   that direct studies of mesophotic habitats allow to collect far more
   detailed information than grabs, ROVs, or towed camera arrays and
   highlights the urgent need to redefine the vertical extension of several
   marine protected areas.}},

Abstract = {{We describe changes in plant diversity and productivity after the

   and collected plant and soil samples from 22 pastures, including five
   pastures that had been abandoned up to 13years earlier. Chemical
   analysis revealed forage nutritive values and soil nutrient levels.
   Overall, plant diversity did not change over time, but productivity and
   forage nutritive values both decreased significantly after pasture
   abandonment. These changes can be explained by (i) lower soil
   nitratenitrogen contents due to leaching and (ii) the replacement of
   sown grasses by native species. Our results suggest that it will become
   more difficult to restore pasture for grazing as the duration of
   abandonment increases and that reintroduction of livestock grazing in
   the abandoned pastures without re-sowing exotic grasses could contribute
   to biodiversity conservation and maintaining productivity and nutritive
   values.}},

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{122}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{The passenger, driver, and opportunist models are conceptual models of
   the invasion process used to describe alternative invasion scenarios. In
   the passenger model, both the invasive species and native community
   respond independently to environmental changes. In the driver model,
   changes to the native community are driven by the invasive species,
   while in the opportunist model invasion occurs in response to changes in
   the native community. In any given invasion scenario, however, it is
   possible that the relationships between the invasive, the native
   community, and the environment correspond to some combination of these
   invasion models acting simultaneously. We study invasion by Poa
   pratensis in a grassland in Alberta, Canada. Poa pratensis is a
   non-native plant implicated with loss of plant diversity in the region.
   In a three year field experiment, we manipulate the environment though
   defoliation, water addition, and nitrogen addition, and measure
   responses of P. pratensis cover, and cover and richness of the native
   community. We use structural equation modelling to describe the
   relationships between the invasive, the native community, and the
   environmental changes, and then interpret these relationships using the
   three invasion models. We found that P. pratensis predominantly invaded
   via the driver model, with subsequent reductions in native plant cover,
   but not in species richness. Positive effects of the environmental
   changes on P. pratensis also aided its ability to drive native cover. As
   well, we found some involvement of the opportunist model, through a
   negative relationship between the native community and the invasive. As
   invasion mainly proceeded via the driver model, management actions to
   limit invasion should focus on efforts to control abundance of P.
   pratensis itself.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The role of unpalatable plant species as biological antiherbivore
   refuges for palatable species is well-documented at community level
   particularly in harsh environments. In productive sub-humid temperate
   grassland subjected to domestic grazing, we examined the protective
   effect of Eryngium horridum on plant community structure and floristic
   composition, and evaluated whether these changes impacted on a number of
   morphological traits of grasses, related to grazing resistance. We also
   investigated, for a palatable grass species (Stipa neesiana) the
   existence of morphological differences between protected and unprotected
   plants and if this eventual variation was either plastic or genetic. The
   study consisted of a field survey where we compared paired patches, with
   and without E. horridum, and a greenhouse experiment where we evaluated
   individuals of S. neesiana coming from both patch types over a 11 months
   period. Patches dominated by E. horridum had lower richness and cover of
   forbs than patches without the forb, and similar richness but greater
   cover of cool-season tussock palatable grasses, which suggests a
   protective role on the latter. Grasses in these patches also had longer
   blades and sheaths and lower specific leaf area. The morphological
   differences of S. neesiana individuals collected from both patch types
   disappeared after 11 months growth in a common environment which
   revealed significant phenotypic plasticity in this species. These
   results suggest the existence of plant-to-plant facilitation in a
   productive ecosystem not only at community level, through changes in
   species richness and the promotion of palatable grasses, but also at
   population level, through plastic changes in aboveground morphological
   traits. Both facilitation and plasticity, would contribute to the
   persistence of threatened palatable grasses in the heavy grazed
   productive ecosystems.}},

   the effects of light winter/spring grazing by cattle (average of 0.75
   cow-calf pairs center dot ha-1) on species richness and percentage cover
   of native and exotic plants from different life-history and life-form
   groups. Results We found that cattle grazing reduced total vegetative
   cover by 25\% and increased bare ground by 40\%. Grazing also caused a
   70\% reduction in above-ground plant biomass and a 40\% reduction in the
   cover of exotic annual grasses, which were by far the most dominant
   group in this system. Grazing also reduced the height and spikelet
   production of the exotic annual grass B. diandrus. In contrast, grazing
   increased the cover of exotic annual forbs by 15\%. Contrary to our
   expectations, grazing did not affect the cover of native forbs and
   grasses, and we hypothesize that these taxa possess life-history
   characteristics and/or depleted seed banks that prevented them from
   responding to grazing during our experiment. Grazing also did not affect
   the species richness of any native or exotic plant group. Conclusions
   Our 3-yr exclosure experiment has shown that grazing by cattle caused
   major changes in a coastal grassland community, with the responses of
   native and exotic taxa having different life-history and life-form
   characteristics varying markedly. Understanding the responses of these
   divergent groups is not only important for basic research evaluating the
   effects of mammalian herbivores on plant communities, but is also
   critical for developing science-based approaches for sustainably
   managing invaded grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Our goal was to assess how management and sward functional diversity
   affect nitrogen response efficiency (NRE), the ratio of plant biomass
   production to supply of available nitrogen (N) in temperate grassland.
   A three-factorial design was employed: three sward compositions, two
   mowing frequencies, and two fertilization treatments.
   NRE was largely influenced by fertilization followed by mowing frequency
   and sward composition. NRE was larger in unfertilized than fertilized
   plots, in plots cut thrice than plots cut once per year, and in control
   swards than in monocot- or dicot-enhanced swards. Fertilization
   decreased NRE through decreases in both N uptake efficiency (plant N
   uptake per supply of available N) and N use efficiency (NUE, biomass
   produced per plant N uptake) whereas mowing frequency and sward
   composition affected NRE through N uptake efficiency rather than NUE.
   The largest NRE in the control sward with 70 \% monocots and 30 \%
   dicots attests that these proportions of functional groups were best
   adapted in this grassland ecosystem.
   Optimum NRE may not be a target of most farmers, but it is an
   appropriate tool to evaluate the consequences of grassland management
   practices, which farmers may employ to maximize profit, on environmental
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Intensifying animal production is generally advocated to mitigate
   greenhouse gases emissions associated with production of animal-source
   food. Sheep farming systems (SFSs) in Spain are generally considered to
   be pasture-based and extensive, but large differences in input
   utilization, land use and intensification level exist. Their
   environmental impacts, therefore, are expected to differ also. We used
   life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate greenhouse gases (GHGs)
   emissions of three contrasting meat-sheep farming systems in Spain,
   which differed in their degree of intensification (reproduction rate,
   land use and grazing management). The GHGs emissions of these systems
   varied from 19.5 to 25.9 kg CO2-eq per kg of lamb live weight, or
   39.0-51.7 kg CO2-eq per kg of lamb meat, with highest values referring
   to the pasture-based livestock system. In addition to meat, however,
   these SFSs also provide other services to society (e.g. public goods
   such as biodiversity and landscape conservation). We valued these
   services for each SFSs based on agri-environmental subsidies of the EU
   and used farm economic values to allocate GHGs emissions of SFSs between
   meat and cultural ecosystem services. When accounting for
   multifunctionality, GHGs emission per kg of lamb live weight among the
   SFSs was reversed: with lowest values for the pasture-based system (13.9
   kg CO2-eq per kg of lamb live weight) and highest for zero-grazing
   system (19.5 kg CO2-eq per kg of lamb live weight). A comparison of GHGs
   emissions among SFSs should account for the multifunctionality of
   pasture-based livestock systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{167}},

Abstract = {{Grasses are a dominant component of meadows and pastures, harboring an
   often overlooked diversity of non-pest stem-boring insects that feed and
   develop exclusively enclosed by plant tissue inside grass shoots.
   Surprisingly, the effects of land-use management on these highly
   specialized communities have rarely been studied. Here, the
   applicability of short-term management reduction as a conservational
   tool, increasing stem-borer colonization success, was examined. On 41
   grasslands in Germany a temporal gradient of set-aside treatments was
   established by experimentally excluding subplots from management, or by
   a priori selection of already abandoned grassland patches. Stem-borer
   abundances and attack heights on resulting managed, 1-season unmanaged
   and >= 2-seasons abandoned treatments were compared.
   Grassland management had a negative effect on stem-borer colonization
   success and spatial niche differentiation. Reducing management over a
   1-season period did not enhance abundances. Two out of three species
   responded positively only to an abandoning treatment lasting >=
   2-seasons, which was also reflected by the decreasing spatial overlap in
   this treatment. Even though grass shoots in unmanaged areas were on
   average 14.9 cm taller than in managed areas, stem-borer abundances did
   not differ between the latter treatments. Hence, preserving essential
   larval development and hibernation habitats in future rotational
   set-aside schemes requires a management exclusion period of at least two
   growing seasons. From these grassy strips, e.g. located at meadow edges,
   highly specialized stem-borers can re-colonize sward islets on
   surrounding intensively managed grasslands, despite of ever changing
   land-use practices and environmental conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Over three years, a replicated block design was used to investigate the
   effects of seed mixtures (grasses only; grasses and legumes; grasses,
   legumes and non-legume forbs), establishment techniques and long term
   management on beetle and spider communities of grassland swards. We
   quantified trophic links between phytophagous beetles and their host
   plants to assess the effect of these seed mixtures and management
   practices on food web structure. When managed under low intensity
   cutting regimes the most diverse seed mixture supported the highest
   biomass of beetles and spiders (c. 3.6 kg ha(-1)). Species richness of
   predatory beetles, phytophagous beetles and spiders were all increased
   by the sowing of legumes, although the addition of other forbs tended to
   result in at most modest further increases in invertebrate species
   richness. Analysis of food web structure suggests that the number of
   host plants utilised by beetles was greatest within the most diverse
   seed mixtures, but that this declined rapidly after the establishment
   year. We demonstrate that by sowing cheap and simple seed mixtures
   agriculturally improved grasslands can be managed to support increased
   diversity of spiders and beetles. While seed mixtures do not necessarily
   need to be of the highest diversity to achieve these benefits, the
   inclusion of legumes does appear to be crucial. The lower costs of
   intermediate diversity seed mixtures increase appeal to farmers,
   increasing the likely uptake of these methodologies in voluntary
   agri-environment schemes. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship of different types of grassland use with plant species
   richness and composition ( functional groups of herbs, legumes, and
   grasses) has so far been studied at small regional scales or comprising
   only few components of land use. We comprehensively studied the
   relationship between abandonment, fertilization, mowing intensity, and
   grazing by different livestock types on plant diversity and composition
   of 1514 grassland sites in three regions in North-East, Central and
   South-West Germany. We further considered environmental site conditions
   including soil type and topographical situation. Fertilized grasslands
   showed clearly reduced plant species diversity (-15\% plant species
   richness, -0.1 Shannon diversity on fertilized grasslands plots of
   16m(2)) and changed composition (-3\% proportion of herb species),
   grazing had the second largest effects and mowing the smallest ones.
   Among the grazed sites, the ones grazed by sheep had higher than average
   species richness (+27\%), and the cattle grazed ones lower (-42\%).
   Further, these general results were strongly modulated by interactions
   between the different components of land use and by regional context:
   land-use effects differed largely in size and sometimes even in
   direction between regions. This highlights the importance of comparing
   different regions and to involve a large number of plots}},

Abstract = {{Hedgerows are valuable habitats for biodiversity in farmed landscapes.
   The herbaceous vegetation at the hedge base is an important component of
   this habitat but its condition in Britain has deteriorated due to a
   combination of nutrient and pesticide contamination, and inappropriate
   management or neglect. The condition of herbaceous hedgerow vegetation
   is included in policy targets for biodiversity conservation, so a
   strategy is required for its restoration. This vegetation can be highly
   variable, so a classification of the main types is required to set
   realistic objectives. Vegetation classifications based on species'
   functional characteristics can have more general application that those
   based on species identity. Using existing datasets from a countrywide
   survey, a functional classification of herbaceous vegetation from
   hedgerows in Britain was developed. Cluster analysis of vegetation
   plots, based on attributes of the species present, produced thirteen
   vegetation types in six broad groups. These were differentiated by the
   association of the component species with woodland, grassland or arable
   habitats and by gradients of soil nutrient status and pH, light
   availability, disturbance and grazing tolerance. By using species'
   ecological characteristics as a basis for the classification, the
   condition of vegetation can be established and the prevailing
   environment predicted. From this information, a realistic strategy for
   restoration can then be determined.}},

Journal = {{ECOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the long-term effect of an ecological network of
   calcareous grasslands, a habitat type that experienced dramatic habitat
   loss and fragmentation during the 20th century, on species richness of
   habitat specialist plants. Calcareous grasslands are of special
   conservation concern as the habitat type with the highest diversity in
   plant and invertebrate species in central Europe. A baseline survey in
   1989 established complete vascular plant species lists for all 62
   previously abandoned calcareous grassland patches in the study area and
   assessed the presence of 48 habitat specialist plant species. An
   ecological network was initiated in 1989 to reconnect these patches with
   existing grazed pastures (core areas) through large flock sheep herding
   where feasible, as sheep are thought to be the primary dispersal vectors
   for calcareous grassland plants. An evaluation survey in 2009 showed
   significant increase in species richness of habitat specialist plants in
   patches reconnected by sheep herding, indicating successful
   colonizations by habitat specialist plants, while ungrazed patches
   showed no significant change. Observed increase in species richness
   between 1989 and 2009 was related to connectivity by sheep herding and
   the presence of a diversity of structural elements providing microsites
   for establishment. Baseline species richness of the patches, which had
   been abandoned since at least 1960, was associated with patch area,
   supporting the effect of ecological drift, and with vegetation type,
   which suggests that delays in extinction may be related to site factors
   governing the strength of competition with later seral species. The
   implementation of this ecological network represents a long-term natural
   experiment' with baseline data, manipulation, and evaluation of
   hypothesized effects on a clearly defined target variable. It thus
   provides much needed empirical evidence that species loss in fragmented
   calcareous grassland communities can be counteracted by restoring
   functional connectivity among remnant patches.}},

Abstract = {{After rainfall and soils, fire and herbivory are two of the main
   determinants of savanna ecosystems. Although the interactive effects of
   fire and herbivores on soil and vegetation are widely acknowledged few
   studies have addressed these two factors in concert, and none of the
   studies has focused on the Kalahari sand system. We experimentally
   studied how annual late dry season fires and grazing affect herbaceous
   plant species composition, above- and belowground biomass, and soil and
   grass nutrient concentrations in the nutrient-poor semi-arid Kalahari
   system in northern Botswana. Four treatments (fire, grazing, fire +
   grazing, and no-fire-no-grazing) were applied for two consecutive years
   in the late dry season. Plant species composition was affected by
   treatment and year. The no-fire-no-grazing treatment was distinctly
   different from all the other treatments in terms of species composition.
   Beta diversity was lower on the fire treatment and grazing treatment,
   but not where fire and grazing were combined. Fire and grazing alone or
   in combination did not have a substantial effect on biomass, soil and
   plant nutrients or plant species alpha diversity. Plant nitrogen was the
   only element that differed between treatments, with high concentrations
   on all the grazed treatments in the first year and low levels on the
   fire-alone treatment during the second year. The results show that fire
   and grazing mainly affect species composition and large-scale
   biodiversity patterns as indicated by the no-fire-no-grazing treatment
   being distinctly different from other treatments, suggesting the
   evolutionary adaptation of this dystrophic Kalahari sand system to
   herbivory and fire.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{. 1.Saltmarsh conservation management often involves livestock grazing
   to maximise plant diversity and provide suitable breeding habitat for
   over-wintering coastal birds. The effect of grazing on invertebrates is
   rarely quantified, but results from limited studies of terrestrial and
   coastal grasslands demonstrate greater abundance and species richness in
   un-grazed grassland. 2.The impact of short sward (<8cm) cattle grazing
   on the ground dwelling invertebrate community was assessed on an English
   inter-tidal upper salt marsh using pitfall traps. Abundance, species
   richness, functional group structure, abundance of coastal specialists,
   environmental factors that influence invertebrate habitat choice and
   food web composition were compared for grazed and un-grazed marsh. 3.In
   total, 90000 invertebrates were sampled. Predatory, zoophagus and
   detritivorous Coleoptera were significantly more abundant on the
   un-grazed marsh. In contrast, predatory Hemiptera and Araneae were
   significantly more abundant on the grazed marsh. Sheet weaver spiders
   were significantly more abundant on the grazed marsh, foliage running
   hunters and space web builders more abundant on the un-grazed marsh.
   Most inter-tidal coastal specialist species exhibited clear habitat
   preference for the grazed marsh. Total species richness was not
   significantly different between grazing treatments. 4.Linear direct
   gradient analysis showed that two environmental variables influenced by
   grazing intensity, soil temperature and vegetation height, significantly
   explained the composition of invertebrate functional groups. Larger
   bodied invertebrates dominated the un-grazed food web. 5.We conclude
   that both short sward cattle grazed and un-grazed saltmarsh habitat
   should be maintained to maximise invertebrate abundance and diversity
   and provide suitable habitat for coastal specialists.}},

Abstract = {{Question Plant functional traits have the potential to characterize
   species ecological strategies and predict ecosystem responses to
   environmental changes. (1) Do trait responses to land-use
   intensification alter trait-based species rankings, and (2) does
   land-use intensification alter relationships among interrelated leaf
   traits? Location Solling Mountains, Central Germany (Grassland
   management experiment, GrassMan). Methods Over the course of 2 yr with
   differing weather conditions, we analysed the specific leaf area (SLA)
   of eight grassland species and related it to leaf nitrogen per mass
   (Nmass) or area (Narea) in an old-growth grassland with two
   fertilization levels (none vs NPK fertilization, 180-30-100 kg center
   dot ha-1 center dot yr-1) and two cutting frequencies (one vs three cuts
   per season). Results NPK fertilization led to an expected increase in
   SLA, Nmass and Narea, while the effect of altered cutting frequency on
   leaf traits was more species-specific. Species-specific responses to
   management significantly altered trait-based species rankings. A
   significant SLANmass relationship occurred in unfertilized plots,
   whereas the SLANarea relationship was stronger in fertilized plots. This
   was mostly caused by a decrease in the among-species variation in Nmass
   upon fertilization. Conclusions Although our results reflect only
   short-term community responses, they indicate that trait-based species
   ranking and the relationships between plant functional traits are not
   always consistent across different management regimes. Hence, trait
   values used to characterize species and communities should never be
   discussed without consideration of the set of environmental conditions
   under which they were measured.}},

Abstract = {{Shrub encroachment can be explained by the abandonment of extensive
   livestock farming and changes to land use, and it is a common problem in
   the Mediterranean mountain pastures of Europe, with direct effects on
   biodiversity and landscape quality. In this paper, the effects of
   livestock exclusion vs. grazing on the dynamics of shrub and herbaceous
   vegetation were analyzed in a Spanish natural park located in a dry
   Mediterranean mountain area over a 5-yr period. Twelve 10 x 10 m
   exclosures were set up in six representative pasture areas of the park
   (with two replicates per location). Each year, the shrub number, volume,
   and biomass were measured in April, and the herbage height, biomass, and
   quality were measured in April and December (which represent the start
   and end of the vegetative growth season). A sustained increase of the
   shrub population and individual biomass was observed throughout the
   study, which was reflected in total shrub biomass per ha. Growth was
   greater in nongrazed exclosures (2563 kg dry matter {[}DM] . ha(-1) .
   yr(-1)), but it also happened in the grazed. control areas (1173 kg DM .
   ha(-1) . yr(-1)), with different patterns depending on the location and
   shrub species. Herbage biomass did not change when grazing was
   maintained, but it did increase in places where grazing was excluded
   (291 kg DM . ha(-1) . yr(-1)), mostly as a consequence of the
   accumulation of dead material, with a concomitant reduction in herbage
   quality. It was concluded that at the current stocking rates and
   management regimes, grazing alone is not enough to prevent the intense
   dynamics of shrub encroachment, and further reductions in grazing
   pressure should be avoided.}},

Abstract = {{Meeting the needs for a growing world population calls for
   multifunctional land use, which can meet the multiple demands of food
   and fuel production, environmental and biodiversity protection, and has
   the capacity for adaptation or resilience to climate change.
   Agroforestry, a land-use system that integrates trees and shrubs with
   crops and/or livestock production, has been identified by the
   International Assessment of Agricultural Knowledge, Science and
   Technology for Development (IAASTD) as a `win-win' approach that
   balances the production of commodities (food, feed, fuel, fiber, etc.)
   with non-commodity outputs such as environmental protection and cultural
   and landscape amenities. Evidence is now coming to light that supports
   the promotion of agroforestry in temperate developed countries as a
   sustainable alternative to the highly industrialized agricultural model
   with its associated negative environmental externalities. This paper
   reviews this evidence within the `ecosystem services' framework to
   evaluate agroforestry as part of a multifunctional working landscape in
   temperate regions. Establishing trees on agricultural land can help to
   mitigate many of the negative impacts of agriculture, for example by
   regulating soil, water and air quality, supporting biodiversity,
   reducing inputs by natural regulation of pests and more efficient
   nutrient cycling, and by modifying local and global climates. The
   challenge now lies in promoting the adoption of agroforestry as a
   mainstream land use through research, dissemination of information and
   policy changes.}},

Title = {{Applying parcel-specific land-use data for improved monitoring of

Volume = {{185}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{A major obstacle to the conservation and management of semi-natural
   grassland (SNG) is the general lack of consistent and precise maps
   showing the extent and quality of this habitat type. SNG is related to,
   and influenced by, agricultural land use. Both intensive land use as
   well as a lack of extensive land use can reduce the extent and quality
   of SNG. For Denmark, this paper demonstrates how parcel-specific
   land-use data can be applied to detect localities with spatial
   convergences and conflicts between SNG and agricultural land use. Based
   on their respective influence on SNG, land use is aggregated into five
   major classes and spatially overlaid with existing nationally registered
   SNG. Results show that almost 11 \% of all SNG is mapped either on
   cropped land or on rotational grassland, indicating a conflict between
   mapped SNG and land use. Thirty percent of SNG is mapped outside any
   agricultural land use, pointing to a lack of management. Fifty nine
   percent of SNG is mapped either on land receiving payments for
   grazing/mowing or on other land under extensive management, indicating a
   convergence between SNG and land use. Finally, 30 \% of land receiving
   payments for grazing/mowing and 62 \% of other land under extensive
   management does not contain any semi-natural habitat. Potential, as yet
   unmapped, SNG might exist in these localities. Based on these results it
   is argued that the application of parcel-specific land-use data could
   significantly improve monitoring of SNG.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing intensification and abandonment are increasing the risk of
   degradation of Mediterranean grasslands. The development of techniques
   for monitoring grazing effects on herbaceous vegetation is an essential
   need for the management of these rangelands. However, the high
   variability of these systems make physiographical and management effects
   hard to disentangle and quantify. We present a methodology to support
   rangeland management and assess grazing effects on environmentally
   heterogeneous areas, and provide an example of its application in a
   Mediterranean rangeland in central Spain. We evaluated the difference in
   photosynthetically active vegetation cover between spring and summer
   using Spectral Mixture Analysis of very high spatial resolution (2.4 m)
   Quickbird images. To analyze this difference, we developed Boosted
   Regression Trees models using grazing management (accumulated cost
   distance to points of livestock concentration and water points) and
   physiographical variables (slope, wetness, proximity to the closest tree
   and orientation). Results show that the main factor determining changes
   in vegetation cover is habitat type. The magnitude of this change was
   maximized at intermediate grazing pressures for humid habitats,
   suggesting the existence of an optimal level of grazing in this zones,
   while in dry habitats differences in vegetation cover increased
   consistently along with grazing pressure. Our models provided a valuable
   insight into how different variables and its interactions affect the
   observed recovery capacity of vegetation. Moreover, by identifying areas
   in which grazing-induced land degradation could be taken place, our
   methodology can be used as a powerful tool in the management of highly
   heterogeneous rangelands. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification is a major threat to biodiversity.
   Agri-environment schemes, the main tools to counteract negative impacts
   of agriculture on the environment, are having mixed effects on
   biodiversity. One reason for this may be the limited number of species
   (groups) covered by most studies. Here, we compared species richness and
   abundance of 10 different species groups on extensively (0.5 cattle/ha)
   and intensively (1.0-1.2 cattle/ha) grazed semi-natural pastures in 42
   fields in three Hungarian regions. Plants, birds and arthropods
   (leafhoppers, true bugs, orthopterans, leaf-beetles, weevils, bees,
   carabids, spiders) were sampled. We recorded 347 plant species, 748
   territories of 43 bird species, and 51,883 individuals of 808 arthropod
   species. Compared to West European farmlands, species richness was
   generally very high. Grazing intensity had minor effects on alpha and
   beta diversity, abundance and composition of the species assemblages.
   Region had significant effects on species richness and abundance of four
   taxa, and had strong effects on beta diversity and species composition
   of all taxa. Regional differences therefore contributed significantly to
   the high overall biodiversity. We conclude that both grazing regimes
   deliver significant biodiversity benefits. Agri-environmental policy at
   the EU level should promote the maintenance of large scale extensive
   farming systems. At the national level, the effectiveness of
   agri-environment schemes should be improved via promoting and using
   research evidence. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, changing climates and land use practices are escalating
   woody-plants encroachment into grasslands, reducing biodiversity and
   altering ecosystem functions. The loss of alpine grasslands is a major
   conservation concern as they harbor many rare and endemic species.
   Alpine meadows in Northwest Yunnan, China, represent a global
   biodiversity hotspot with high species richness, beta diversity, and
   endemism. Shrubs have expanded greatly in the region and threaten alpine
   meadow biodiversity. To measure rates of meadow loss due to shrub
   encroachment and identify its mechanisms, we reconstructed alpine land
   cover, climate, and land use change from 1950 to 2009 across Northwest
   Yunnan using satellite data, ground surveys, and interviews. Between
   1990 and 2009, at least 39\% of the alpine meadows converted to woody
   shrubs. The patterns of change suggest that a regime shift is occurring.
   Despite multiple perturbations to the climate and land use systems
   starting in the 1950s, alpine meadows remained resilient to shrub
   expansion until the late 1980s. Shrublands rapidly expanded then due to
   feedback mechanisms involving climate, woody cover, and grazing. Fire
   may no longer be an effective tool for controlling shrub expansion. This
   regime shift threatens both endemic meadow biodiversity and local
   livelihoods. More generally, these trends serve as a warning sign for
   the greater Himalayan region where similar vegetation changes could
   greatly affect livelihoods, hydrology, and climate. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{158}},
Pages = {{239-247}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands have become increasingly important to
   conservation in both temperate and subtropical regions due to their
   diversity and escalating pressures toward conversion or abandonment. As
   more semi-natural grasslands are incorporated into conservation
   easements or other protected areas, questions arise about appropriate
   management for maintaining biodiversity. We conducted an 8 year
   split-plot experiment on the effect of season of burn and nutrient
   status on plant composition in semi-natural grassland released from
   ranchland management. Our objective was to find alternative approaches
   to manage semi-natural grasslands under varying nutrient enrichment when
   typical ranch management is ceased. We predicted that: (I) burning at
   high fertility would counteract competitive exclusion and increase
   diversity and that this increase would be greatest in the historical
   fire season (summer) to which species are adapted; and (2) that plant
   composition in plots released from disturbance would shift to greater
   abundance of competitive species, including shrubs, which would displace
   smaller grass and forb species and result in reduced diversity. Total
   species richness and graminoid richness were lowest in unburned,
   ungrazed plots. Graminoid richness was greatest in winter burned-grazed
   plots (due mainly to sedges) and forb richness was greatest in summer
   burn plots. In unburned plots, after 5 years, a native shrub, Eupatorium
   capillifolium (Lam.) Small, and native forb, Lachnanthes caroliniana
   (Lam.) Dandy, became abundant and grasses declined. Winter burn plots
   were dominated by a small shrub, Euthamia graminifolia (L.) Nutt. var.
   hirtipes (Fernald) C. and J. Taylor. Our experiment suggests that
   maintaining grassland structure and reducing shrub cover in grasslands
   released from typical ranchland management in subtropical Florida
   requires burning, and that summer is the most beneficial season of burn
   to reduce shrub encroachment and encourage both graminoid and forb
   richness. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Land managers are grappling with massive changes in vegetation
   structure, particularly in protected areas formerly subjected to fire
   and grazing. The objective of this review was to compare notes on the
   historical and current management of ecosystems around the world
   (especially in wet to dry grasslands in the Americas, Australia, Africa,
   Europe and Asia) with respect to the usage of fire, grazing and cutting
   to reduce dominance and support the biodiversity of rare species. This
   review suggests that former disturbances, which are now often lost, may
   have once kept tall vegetation from pushing out rarer subdominant
   species. In cases where prehistoric biodiversity depended on fire or
   large ungulate grazing, traditional agricultural and indigenous
   practices may have carried biodiversity forward to historical times by
   mimicking pre-cultural disturbances (e.g., lightning fire and bison
   grazing). Ironically, biodiversity related to species richness,
   landscape heterogeneity and function may decline in preserves,
   especially if traditional management once maintained this biodiversity.
   Managers can benefit from a cross-continental comparison of the full
   arsenal of management techniques used to control encroaching vegetation.

Title = {{Does soil seed bank diversity limit post-fire regeneration in small,

Abstract = {{Soil collected from 38 sites on Kangaroo Island in South Australia,
   containing small remnants of senescent Eucalyptus cneorifolia-dominated
   mallee, was subject ex situ to both smoke aerosol and heat treatment to
   simulate burning. Further soil from a subset of 29 of the sites was left
   untreated as a control. A total of 113 native plant species and 50
   introduced species germinated across all sites. Fifty-three of the
   native plant species that germinated were absent in the above-ground
   vegetation, including twelve rare or threatened species, and three
   species previously unrecorded from Kangaroo Island. Fourteen native
   species and six introduced species germinated in heat plus smoke treated
   soil but not in untreated soil from the same sites. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling ordination indicated differences in native
   species composition between sites with a long history of sustained
   livestock grazing ({''}grazed{''} sites) and largely ungrazed sites
   ({''}ungrazed{''} sites). On average, significantly more native species
   germinated from treated soil sampled from ``ungrazed{''} sites than were
   found in the standing vegetation, while for ``grazed{''} sites this
   difference was not significant. This indicates the greater potential for
   post-fire regeneration of native vegetation from the soil seed bank of
   ungrazed sites than from that of long grazed sites. Both ``ungrazed{''}
   and ``grazed{''} sites contained weeds in their soil seed banks,
   including some species which were stimulated by heat plus smoke. This
   indicated that competition from weeds is potentially a problem when fire
   is used as a management tool to regenerate senescent understoreys. (C)

Title = {{Re-establishment of Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull in an eight-year grazing

Journal = {{JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{22-30}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Upland heathland is an internationally important habitat but a large
   area in the UK has been degraded to acid grassland by intensive
   livestock grazing. Re-establishment of dwarf shrubs, particularly
   Calluna vulgaris (L.) Hull, is a key objective for restoring heathland
   on these sites. A replicated plot-scale experiment was set up to examine
   effects of disturbance and seed addition on C. vulgaris establishment in
   a Nardus stricta L. grassland under three grazing regimes: sheep only
   (1.5 ewes ha(-1) for 10 months per year); cattle only (0.5 heifers
   ha(-1) in summer only); and, the cattle regime combined with sheep (1.0
   ewes ha(-1) for 10 months per year). Early results of the experiment
   have been reported previously but it was not known if these results were
   an indication of the longer-term restoration success. Here we evaluate
   the success of the restoration methods (disturbance, seeding treatments
   and grazing regime) eight years after the treatments began. In seeded
   plots, young C. vulgaris plants had greatest above-ground height, dry
   weight and shoot length if grazing was excluded or the cattle-only
   regime was applied. C. vulgaris cover was greatest, and increased most,
   in plots that had been disturbed, seeded and ungrazed or subjected to
   the cattle-only regime. The vegetation in these plots also became more
   similar to reference sites with 50\% or more cover of C. vulgaris. The
   invasive Juncus effusus L. was more frequent in disturbed and grazed
   plots but less frequent in plots with C. vulgaris established from added
   seed. Previous results that showed the benefits of disturbance and
   seeding treatments were still valid but changes in the vegetation
   composition were still occurring and longer-term studies will be needed
   to determine when grazing regimes including sheep might be reintroduced.

Journal = {{JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{56-62}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We evaluated the effects of afforestation on the composition and
   structure of southern Brazilian subtropical grasslands directly beneath
   tree plantations, in pastures, and in permanent protection areas near
   watercourses. Cover of plants was registered in 120 plots of 1 m(2) in
   grasslands located at two distances from small watercourses in pasture
   and eucalypt plantation areas within a livestock ranching landscape.
   Livestock density is reduced in plantation areas. Species composition
   beneath tree plantations was significantly different from both pasture
   and nearby permanent protection areas. Permanent protection areas near
   plantations were also compositionally different from pastures. Eucalypt
   plantation was the environment type where ruderals were most abundant.
   Growth form cover distribution in pasture areas showed a consistent
   pattern, with graminous herbs being the most common growth form followed
   by prostrate herbs, prostrate subshrubs, and standing subshrubs. In
   plantation areas, the dominance of the graminoid herb growth form
   increased markedly, as well as standing herbs. These increases occurred
   mainly at the expense of prostrate herbs and subshrubs, which were
   significantly reduced. Plot-level species density was significantly
   affected by distance from watercourse and, more importantly, was
   significantly influenced by the interaction between management regime
   and distance to watercourse. It was reduced in eucalypt plantations
   relative to permanent protected areas. Current management of eucalypt
   plantations in southern Brazil produce unsuitable conditions for
   grassland species to thrive within plantations. Livestock densities <1.0
   animal unit ha(-1) in eucalypt plantations undermines the ability of
   surrounding permanent protection areas to act as ecological networks for
   biodiversity conservation. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{8-15}},

Abstract = {{After direct habitat transformation, biological invasions are considered
   to be the second most important threat to biodiversity. A better
   understanding of the factors affecting invasion success in new areas is
   crucial, and may provide insight into potential control actions. We
   hypothesized that invasion risk increases in habitats undergoing a
   sudden change in the disturbance regime or environmental conditions. For
   testing this assumption we initiated a seed sowing experiment while
   introducing two novel treatments, mowing twice and fertilizer
   application, in two grassland sites (one dryer and one mesic) in
   Romania. The seeds of two invasive species, Solidago canadensis and
   Rudbeckia laciniata, and two resident natives of similar seed sizes,
   life-forms and strategies were sowed in treated and control plots, and
   seed germination, seedling establishment and growth were followed during
   four months. Contrary to our expectations, there was no difference in
   the treatment effects on seed germination and seedling establishment
   between species, while there was on seedling vigour of the larger seeded
   species in the dryer grassland site, where the native had a higher
   performance especially in increased nutrient conditions. Indifferently
   from applied treatments, invasive species had greater cumulative
   germination in the mesic site, while natives were far more successful in
   seedling establishment in the drier site. At the same time, seed size
   was found to be a very important factor explaining germination and
   establishment success, with large seeded species outperforming small
   seeded species in any circumstances. Our results call the attention upon
   management interventions in mesic, productive grassland sites opening
   colonization windows for the recruitment of those invasive species of
   which ecological requirements correspond to local environmental
   conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BOTANY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{62-68}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Grazing resistance in plants, which can be defined as the ability to
   grow and reproduce under grazed conditions, is either associated to
   defoliation avoidance or tolerance. Clonal traits are often neglected
   when studying functional responses to grazing, despite frequent
   occurrence in grassland vegetation. We investigated whether clonal
   traits and response to defoliation were associated to increased grazing
   resistance. First, grazing resistance was estimated for eight clonal
   species using abundance patterns in a long-term field study. We then
   analysed its correlation with traits in undisturbed conditions and
   responses to defoliation in a garden experiment. A few traits were
   correlated to grazing resistance, though only one was a clonal trait
   (belowground clonal biomass). Grazing resistance was negatively
   correlated to shoot height and belowground clonal biomass and positively
   correlated to inflorescence biomass, suggesting that tall rhizomatous
   species investing little in sexual reproduction were at a disadvantage
   under grazed conditions. Both shoot height and belowground clonal
   biomass were negatively affected by defoliation but their decrease was
   significantly less for species that expressed the greatest grazing
   resistance in the field. Our findings show that incorporating clonal
   traits slightly improved predictions about field grazing resistance in
   the eight investigated species.}},

Abstract = {{Nature conservation in Norway is based on the idea that wilderness and
   forest nature reserves should be left to develop naturally. Several
   studies show that forests have been influenced by human activities to a
   large extent. The article documents former land use practices in a
   boreal forest landscape in Nordli, Central Norway, and discussed the
   ecological consequences with respect to conservation. Traditionally,
   outfield resources were utilized for haymaking, pollarding, coppicing,
   grazing, and summer farming. Fodder harvesting methods were closely
   related to ecological conditions and the production level in the boreal
   forest landscape. Systematic burning to improve the forest pastures was
   a natural part of the traditional farming system. The forests were still
   utilized for grazing as late as 1973. In the man-influenced' landscape
   in Nordli, two boreal forest areas are protected due both to their
   wilderness character and the presence of native forest species. However,
   these nature reserves are parts of an extensively utilized forest
   landscape, where also human footprints are found. It is concluded that
   to ensure successful conservation of the biodiversity of these and other
   such forests, former land use practices should be documented, and
   management schemes should be developed on the basis of the acquired
   knowledge.}},

Title = {{Propagule pressure, not fire or cattle grazing, promotes invasion of

Abstract = {{The invasion of exotic grasses into savannas is occurring globally.
   Despite threats to ecosystem processes and biodiversity, few studies
   have investigated factors that facilitate invasion success. The
   abundance of the exotic perennial Cenchrus ciliaris buffel grass was
   assessed across woodland clearings at 46 sites in Queensland, Australia.
   The influence of fire and grazing on the invasion success were also
   examined experimentally within 18 sampling stations (including cattle
   grazed and ungrazed treatment pairs) with unburnt, low-intensity and
   high-intensity fire treatments. Mixed-effects logistic regressions
   suggest that the probability of buffel grass occurring in remnants was
   predominantly a function of the abundance of buffel grass in adjoining
   paddocks. The abundance of buffel grass in remnants was greater where
   the boundaries with clearings faced the prevailing wind adjacent to
   paddocks with high buffel grass abundance. There was a significant
   positive association between buffel grass and tree canopies at
   approximately half of the sites, and the strength of this association
   was positively related to the amount of coarse sand in the surface soil.
   This association was interpreted as nutrient enrichment from litter fall
   on sandy infertile soils being a requirement for invasion. The invasion
   of buffel grass at the experimental site accelerated with above-average
   rainfall after a prolonged drought, and invasion continued even after
   imposing all combinations of fire and grazing. Cattle grazing modestly
   enhanced invasion, relative to the absence of grazing, but this
   difference was only significant without burning. The occurrence of fire
   in both the survey and experiment was not associated with enhanced
   buffel grass invasion. Invasion of buffel grass may be inevitable over
   large areas of savanna, especially when abundant rainfall follows
   periods of drought. However, invasion will be minimized in areas where
   buffel grass has not been planted, areas without cattle grazing and in
   areas with low soil fertility. Synthesis and applications. The invasion
   of buffel grass accelerates during abundant rainfall after drought and
   is enhanced by propagule pressure, dispersal trajectories and under
   trees, probably as a result of nutrient enrichment. Disturbance had
   little influence on invasion, and there is no support for fire-promoted
   invasion as predicted by the grassfire cycle theory.}},

Title = {{Overcoming resistance and resilience of an invaded community is

Abstract = {{The search for appropriate management strategies to control invasive
   plants is an important theme in environmental management. However, the
   recovery of the resident community species complement does not
   necessarily respond predictably to restoration efforts. Increasing
   restoration success requires an understanding of the resistance and
   resilience of the invaded community and the response of the newly
   developing community to management. Here, we used Pteridium-invaded
   heath and grass communities as a test system and investigated the
   effects of recommended Pteridium aquilinum control treatments on
   vegetation composition and diversity. We evaluated seven field
   experiments in four regions of Great Britain designed to test five
   Pteridium control treatments, including one-off' (applied only at the
   start) and repeated' (applied regularly) treatments, against an
   untreated experimental control. The sites had context-dependent
   restoration targets, either a Calluna heathland or acid grassland.
   Species cover and diversity responses (higher plants, mosses plus
   lichens) to these treatments were monitored annually for 10years.
   Pteridium control treatments induced significant change in species
   composition compared to experimental controls in both vegetation types.
   On Calluna target sites, repeated' treatments overcame the resistance of
   the invaded community producing a gradual divergence in species
   composition and species diversity. In contrast, the one-off' treatments
   were ineffective. At the acid grassland target sites, all treatments
   overcame the resistance of the Pteridium-dominated state producing
   changes in species composition in comparison with experimental controls.
   Synthesis and applications. There are two important results for land
   managers: (i) where Calluna heathland is the target, repeated'
   treatments (cutting once or twice per year) were effective in overcoming
   the resistance of invaded community and moving species composition
   towards the target state, effectively creating an alternative state;
   (ii) where acid grassland is the target both one-off' and repeated'
   treatments overcame the invaded community resistance (one-off' also
   overcame resilience) producing changes in species composition in the
   desired direction. The effectiveness of one-off' treatments was site
   dependent and produced alternative stable states within 10years. In
   contrast, repeated' treatments were site independent but took longer to
   work and were more expensive.}},
