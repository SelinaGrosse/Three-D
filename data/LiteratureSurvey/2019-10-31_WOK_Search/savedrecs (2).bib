Abstract = {{Traits that favor rapid plant growth are expected to have an important
   influence on species relative abundance (SRA) in semi-natural grasslands
   where competitive exclusion is reduced by grazing. However, which traits
   are more strongly associated with variation in SRA remains largely
   unknown, especially in P-limited but species-rich grasslands. We
   assessed the relative importance of traits predicting SRA in P-limited
   Tibetan alpine meadows subject to long term grazing. We assessed
   abundance in terms of both aboveground biomass and ramet numbers in
   relation to seven traits (specific leaf area, LDMC: leaf dry matter
   content, leaf carbon concentration, leaf nitrogen concentration, LPC:
   leaf phosphorus concentration, mature height, and seed size) for all
   component species in grazed and ungrazed plots in each of three
   contrasting sites on the Tibetan Plateau. We used CATS regression (i.e.
   regression for Community Assembly through Trait Selection) to quantify
   the relative importance of different traits in predicting SRA, and
   tested dependence of trait importance values on both environmental
   context and alternative measures of abundance. Species were primarily
   differentiated along a trade-off axis involving traits promoting
   nutrient acquisition for fast growth vs resource conservation and
   competitive ability. A higher LPC consistently was the most important
   trait predicting species abundance in grazed plots, while species with
   low LPC but higher LDMC held an advantage in ungrazed plots. This
   suggests that in competition-released communities, species with a high
   ability to uptake soil available P tend to become abundant, while in
   competition-dominated communities, species using fixed P efficiently do
   better. The relative importance of traits in ungrazed plots did not
   change across sites, but in grazed plots species that have traits
   associated with nutrient conservation were favored in colder and drier
   conditions. The results highlight the importance of traits affecting
   acquisition of soil available P in these Tibetan alpine meadow
   communities. Species tradeoffs in nutrient acquisition versus
   conservation are a primary determinant of SRA, but the relative
   importance of traits depended on both environmental context and whether
   SRA was estimated as above-ground biomass or as number of ramets. (C)

Abstract = {{QuestionWhich types of management practice promote plant species
   richness in semi-natural grasslands? Which environmental factors might
   be involved in this management effect? How do different plant life-form
   groups respond to these variables?
   LocationKaida Plateau, Nagano Prefecture, Japan.
   MethodsIn the study area, hay meadows were traditionally maintained
   through both burning and mowing every second year. Recently, however,
   meadows that have either been abandoned or maintained only by annual
   burning or annual mowing have increased. We compared plant species
   richness, vegetation height and soil pH and water content between
   traditional meadows and those abandoned or maintained only by burning or
   mowing. We also examined relationships between these variables and the
   species richness of plant life-form groups.
   ResultsThe mean total and rare plant richness (36 and eightspeciesm(-2),
   respectively) in traditionally managed meadows were higher than in
   meadows of other management types (<26 and 5speciesm(-2), respectively).
   Vegetation height (20-290cm) and soil pH (4.2-6.2) varied among study
   plots. Burning and mowing frequencies negatively influenced vegetation
   height and positively influenced soil pH and/or water content.
   Traditional management practice provided intermediate vegetation heights
   (90cm) and soil pH (5.3). Total species richness showed a unimodal
   relationship with vegetation height (peaking at 125cm), and rare species
   richness was highest at intermediate levels of vegetation height (86cm)
   and soil pH (5.2).
   ConclusionsThis study demonstrates that intermediate levels of
   vegetation height and soil pH have been maintained through traditional
   practices combining both infrequent burning and mowing. These practices
   are essential for conserving common and rare plant diversity in the
   study area with oligotrophic soil conditions.}},

Abstract = {{AimsThe effects of pastoralism on grassy vegetation are predicted to
   vary across spatial scales. However, local-scale effects have generally
   been better considered than large-scale effects that may be pertinent
   for plant diversity conservation. We examined variation in plant
   diversity in an agricultural region by comparing patterns observed at
   large and local scales for different land uses. We tested whether
   habitat specificity (which relates to how specific different species are
   to particular land uses) can indicate the importance of land uses to
   plant diversity conservation.
   LocationNorthwest Slopes of New South Wales, Australia.
   MethodsWe surveyed 127 quadrats of grassy vegetation across four land
   uses: previously cultivated and never-cultivated native pastures, grazed
   woodland and ungrazed woodlands (grazing refugia). We assessed (1)
   species density at the quadrat scale, (2) correlations among explanatory
   variables and species composition using ordination techniques, and (3)
   habitat specificity at the regional scale using the -diversity
   contribution index.
   ResultsAt the quadrat scale, differences in species density among land
   uses were not pronounced. In contrast, habitat specificity was highest
   in ungrazed, unfertilized woodlands. Land uses that were grazed, cleared
   of trees and fertilized were generally species dense at the quadrat
   scale (>40 species 400m(-2)), but were comprised of a limited suite of
   native and exotic grasses and forbs, with relatively homogeneous
   composition across the region.
   ConclusionsIn the region studied, grazing refugia with no tree clearing
   or history of fertilizer application were valuable for conserving a
   large number of native species, and so should be protected. Such land
   uses are currently rare in the region. Simple measures of native or
   total species density were insufficient for evaluating conservation
   value, as they did not distinguish habitats with large numbers of
   common, generalist native species from those with species that were rare
   or restricted in the region. Analyses of habitat specificity may
   potentially overcome the pitfalls of basing conservation management
   decisions on local-scale measures. Our results also highlighted a need
   to understand the processes associated with management practices that
   serve to reduce species diversity at landscape and regional scales.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsCan signs of 19th century grassland management, which can be
   observed in the flora immediately (2-4yrs) after clear-cutting in
   boreonemoral Sweden, still remain 4yrs later? Do the effects from the
   time since clear-cutting differ between forest and grassland plant
   species?
   LocationProvince of ostergotland, southern Sweden.
   MethodsTwelve contemporary clear-cut areas that were once meadows and 12
   that were once forests were selected using land-use maps from the 1870s.
   Grasses and herbaceous plants were surveyed twice, once in 2009 and once
   in 2013 (2-4 and 6-8yrs after clear-cutting, respectively). Plant
   presence was recorded within 100 circular sample plots (radius 1m)
   placed evenly throughout each respective clear-cut area along transects
   spaced 25-m apart. The number of sample plots in which a species was
   present was taken as a measure of that species' frequency. Random
   effects meta-analysis, odds ratios and ANCOVA were used to analyse
   species responses to clear-cutting over time.
   ResultsA total of 170 plant species were found in the study, of which 33
   were classified as grassland indicator species and 31 as plants
   primarily confined to forests. Clear-cut areas with a history as
   meadowland had, on average, up to 64\% higher total species richness and
   110\% more grassland indicator species than did clear-cut areas with a
   history as forest. The time since clear-cutting had no effect on total
   species richness. However, the odds of finding a grassland indicator
   species decreased with the time since clear-cutting, whereas the odds of
   finding a forest species increased.
   ConclusionsWe concluded that land-use history plays an important role in
   explaining the flora found in Swedish clear-cuts, and that its effects
   on species richness remain for a minimum of 8yrs after harvest
   (conservative estimate). This phenomenon highlights the importance of
   acknowledging land-use legacies in ecological research and conservation.
   Future studies should investigate various options for the promotion of
   grassland plants in clear-cuts with a history of grassland management
   while also acknowledging the potential conflicts between conservation
   and production. The results may pertain to other countries with similar
   land-use histories.}},

Abstract = {{Natural floodplains belong to the most species-rich ecosystems
   worldwide. However, over the last decades there has been a strong
   decrease in the extent of natural floodplains. As a consequence, the
   biodiversity of these ecosystems has experienced a dramatic decline. In
   this study, we investigated the habitat and food preferences of the
   grasshopper species Chorthippus binotatus on gravel banks of a nearly
   natural river system in the Spanish Pyrenees. The studied plots on the
   alluvial gravel banks in the Spanish Pyrenees were characterised by
   strong differences in habitat structure. However, C. binotatus only
   occurred in sparsely-vegetated sub-Mediterranean dry grasslands. The
   abundance of the grasshopper species was also strongly related to
   habitat structure and cover of the main food source and dominant plant
   species of these open grasslands, the dwarf shrub Genista scorpius.
   Concerning habitat structure, the grasshopper species preferred habitats
   with sparse and low-growing vegetation with a high cover of bare ground
   and gravel/stones. C. binotatus occupies a very narrow ecological niche
   within the studied floodplain. It requires sparsely-vegetated gravel
   banks that ensure sufficient oviposition sites and a favourable ambient
   temperature for optimal development. G. scorpius dwarf shrubs have to be
   considered as multi-functional key elements in the habitats of C.
   binotatus. They offer high-quality food, shelter against predators and
   allow thermoregulation in a hot and dry Mediterranean environment. For
   the conservation of C. binotatus, we recommend maintaining and restoring

Abstract = {{In August 2014, we discovered a surprisingly high species richness of
   aquatic macrophytes (33 species) in Lake Fil only two years after the
   large, shallow lake had been re-established following land reclamation
   and 60 years of intense agricultural use. In 2015, plant richness had
   increased even further (to 40 species). Some rare, oligotrophic species,
   which formerly were common in the historical lake, have re-established
   populations (e.g. Elatine hydropiper and Lythrum portula). However, a
   larger number of meso-and eutrophic species have colonized the
   re-established lake, changing the character of aquatic macrophyte flora
   as compared to the historical lake. The very rare Baldellia repens,
   considered extinct species in Denmark, has become re-established with at
   least 13 subpopulations in the new Lake Fil. Also two species recently
   discovered in Denmark (Callitriche obtusangula and Lemna turionifera)
   were found. Half of the species may have colonized the re-established
   lake from now submerged drainage canals and from an upstream lake, while
   the other half presumably have colonized from more distant lakes. The
   high richness of aquatic macrophytes in the re-established Lake Fil is
   matched by only a few natural lakes in Denmark. According to predictions
   of species richness from environmental conditions and colonized area in
   56 natural Danish lakes, the observed richness in Lake Fil is two-fold
   the expected. We attribute the high plant richness to: shallow waters,
   large open areas on grazed or physically exposed lake shores and high
   likelihood of species recruitment from neighboring lakes via dense
   populations of migratory waterfowl. High plant richness was established
   despite low transparency due to high release of dissolved organic matter
   and particles from flooded soils. We conclude that suitable bathymetry,
   physical disturbance, grazing by cattle and waterfowl in the littoral
   zone and high dispersal capacity of propagules may ensure rapid
   establishment of a rich aquatic vegetation in new lakes, even when
   nutrient-rich farmland is the starting point. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean region, endozoochorous seed dispersal is a

   species of the Mediterranean area (Ornithopus compressus L, Biserrula
   pelecinus L., Medicago polymorpha L, Melilotus officinalis L Pall,
   Festuca ovina L and Dactylis glomerata L). We also examined whether the
   inclusion of the seeds in dung affected seed germination and seedling
   establishment and growth. The highest seed recovery rate was obtained
   24-72 h after ingestion. The amount of retrieved seeds varied among
   species and was generally low, with significant differences among some
   leguminous and grass species. With the exception of M. officinalis, the
   quantity of retrieved legume seeds (1.5-6.8\%) was greater than that of
   the grass seeds (0.9-1.1\%). A significant relationship was found
   between recovery of the seeds and their hardness and volume. In all
   species, the recovered seeds presented significantly lower germinability
   than seeds that had not been consumed. In general, all recovered legume
   seeds showed higher average germination rate values (18-50\%) compared
   to recovered grass seeds (0-14\%). Seedling emergence was lower in
   intact than in crumbled dung pellets and, in most cases, the values of
   both of these were lower than that of unconsumed (control) seeds. No
   seedling emergence was recorded for seeds of B. pelecinus and O.
   compressus contained in intact or crumbled faeces at all sampling times.
   While the percentages of recovery and subsequent emergence found in this
   study are low in absolute terms, we can conclude that a significant
   number of seeds may become established from the dung and could be a

Abstract = {{Most tallgrass prairies have been destroyed or altered, making
   restoration an important component to their conservation. Our goal was
   to evaluate progress 12-years post-restoration at Spirit Mound Historic

   in plant diversity, richness, evenness, non-native species relative
   abundance, and community composition from 2004 to 2013. Areas with
   different restoration treatments and land-use histories showed divergent
   results. Seventy percent of the site, previously annual row crop, was
   reconstructed using herbicide application followed by native seeding
   (hereafter reconstruction). Areas that were previously grazed, 15 \% of
   the site, were restored with only partial seeding and no herbicide
   treatment (hereafter rehabilitation). Species richness and diversity
   increased over 40 \% in the reconstruction since 2004 and remained over
   1.9 times higher in the reconstructed areas than rehabilitated areas.
   Diversity did not change in the rehabilitation, but richness increased
   47 \% since 2004. Evenness decreased 11-26 \% over time in both areas.
   Non-native species relative abundance did not change from 2004 to 2013,
   and remained five times higher in the rehabilitation than the
   reconstruction. Native C-4 grass and forb abundance increased over time
   in the reconstruction, whereas non-native C-3 grasses remained dominant
   in the rehabilitation. These results showed that restoration outcomes
   were radically different 12-years post-restoration among areas with
   different prior land uses that were subjected to different restoration
   practices. Long-term assessments are important to accurately determine

Abstract = {{Small herbivores play keystone functional roles in grassland ecosystems.
   Recognising the combined effects where herbivores co-exist is important
   for guiding grassland restoration and biodiversity conservation. On the
   Tibetan Plateau, both plateau pikas and Himalayan marmots are regarded
   as pests by Tibetan people and local government, but little is known
   about their combined effects. We conducted a field study to determine
   the combined effects of pikas and marmots on plant biodiversity and
   vegetation structure. Plateau pikas alone consistently reduced the plant
   height and diversity and increased the vegetation cover of physically
   unpalatable plants. However, the co-existence of marmots with pikas
   decreased the vegetation cover of physically unpalatable plants, while
   increasing the cover of palatable plants and plant diversity, ultimately

Abstract = {{Extensive reforestation may be required to avert dramatic loss of
   biodiversity, system resilience and ecosystem services from Brazil's
   Atlantic Forest, and is legally required by Brazil's Forest Code.
   Restoration on farmland however threatens agricultural output and the
   livelihoods of small family farmers, leading to weak enforcement of the
   law and a national debate over the Code which resulted in revisions in
   2012 that significantly reduced legally mandated restoration. To inform
   the design of effective environmental policies, we interviewed 60
   typical dairy family farmers utilizing pasture-based agroecological
   grazing practices to assess their perceptions and knowledge of the
   pre-2012 Forest Code, its impacts and their willingness to comply.
   Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) identified three distinct
   clusters: farmers who understood the forest code and its ecological
   impacts and were willing to comply; farmers who understood the
   ecological benefits of restoration, but were unwilling to comply; and
   those with little knowledge of benefits or interest in compliance. We
   evaluate three policy options for promoting restoration, paying
   particular attention to their impacts on farmer livelihoods and on their
   intrinsic willingness to restore and preserve forest cover. We conclude
   that payments for ecosystem services in the form of subsidies for
   agroecology practices are promising. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Vegetation succession on glacier forelands has been well-studied.
   However, most of the studies investigated only one or few glacier
   forelands. We studied regional variations in vegetation succession on 16
   glacier forelands in the European Alps. To improve our understanding of
   how vegetation succession is regulated by environmental conditions, we
   took edaphic and climatic factors into account. We collected vegetation
   data in three stages (early; middle; late) along a successional gradient
   on glacier forelands in the Eastern and Western European Alps. The
   progressions of species richness, vegetation cover and composition
   during primary succession were compared between these two regions. In
   addition, the effects of climatic and edaphic factors and grazing were
   tested. Our results reveal that the vegetation from the early stage did
   not differ between the regions and different elevations. With
   progressing time, and especially in the late successional stage, several
   vegetation differences emerged. The forelands of the Western Alps
   already developed to open shrubland, while the forelands of the Eastern
   Alps so far only developed toward grassland. Surprisingly, these
   differences cannot be explained by different precipitation amounts, but
   possibly by different regional species pools and elevations of the
   treelines. We conclude that a complex of edaphic factors closely related
   to terrain age, regional differences in the species pool, and the
   different elevation of the treeline in the eastern and western Alps
   mostly influenced later stages of primary succession on glacier
   forelands.}},

Abstract = {{The research aim was to understand how variation of temperature and

   sub-Mediterranean climate, where climate change is expected to intensify
   summer aridity. In the central Italy, we recorded species abundance and
   elevation, slope aspect and angle in 129 plots. The traits we analysed
   were life span, growth form, clonality, belowground organs, leaf traits,
   plant height, seed mass, and palatability. We used Ellenberg's
   indicators as a proxy to assess air temperature and soil moisture
   gradients. From productive to harsh conditions, we observed a shift from
   tolerance to avoidance strategies, and a change in resource allocation
   strategies to face competition and stress or that maximize exploitation
   of patchily distributed soil resource niches. In addition, we found that
   the increase of temperature and water scarcity leads to the
   establishment of regeneration strategies that enable plants to cope with
   the unpredictability of changes in stress intensity and duration. Since
   the dry habitats of higher elevations are also constrained by winter
   cold stress, we argue that, within the sub-Mediterranean bioclimate,
   climate change will likely lead to a variation in dominance inside plant
   communities rather than a shift upwards of species ranges. At higher
   elevations, drought-adaptive traits might become more abundant on
   south-facing slopes that are less stressed by winter low temperatures;
   traits related to productive conditions and cold stress would be
   replaced on north-facing slopes by those adapted to overcome both the

Abstract = {{QuestionsDo the effects of grazing components on vegetation structure
   differ in their relative importance? Do components interact in their
   effect on vegetation?
   LocationSan Jose department, Southern Campos, Uruguay.
   MethodsIn a manipulative field experiment we simulated three different
   grazing components: trampling, defoliation and urine deposition, over
   3yr in a natural grassland. Defoliation was analysed through two
   intensity levels and two procedures: uniform and selective cutting. We
   evaluated the effects of grazing components on species diversity and
   composition, and frequency of plant functional types.
   ResultsAll simulated grazing components had at least some effect on
   vegetation structure. Additionally, both individual and interactive
   effects on vegetation attributes were detected. Our study indicates that
   the relative influence of each grazing component varied according to the
   attribute considered. N addition was the only treatment that affected
   plant diversity. Plant functional type composition, in turn, was
   affected mainly by trampling. N addition and trampling were the
   component that affected the frequency of the largest number of species.
   Defoliation selectivity showed effects both in terms of plant functional
   type and species composition. Exclosure treatment and defoliation
   intensity had slight effects on grassland structure.
   ConclusionsThis study provides insight on the underlying mechanisms of
   some observed patterns of grazing on the Campos grasslands. Our results
   lead us to conclude that all grazing components have to be taken into
   account to understand vegetation dynamics subjected to grazing.
   Prevention of woody encroachment by grazing can be attributed to direct
   and indirect effects of trampling. Trampling should be taken into
   account to explain increaser species responses. However, mechanisms
   responsible for other general patterns remain less clear. The importance
   of selective defoliation in species replacement induced by grazing in
   these grasslands has yet to be clarified.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsPlant communities of road verges adjoining arable fields are

   management practices influence their abundance in field margins?
   LocationCentral-western France.
   MethodsThree adjacent elements located between district roads and winter
   cereal fields - i.e. berm, embankment and field margin - were sampled in
   40 road-field boundaries situated in an agricultural area. Management
   practices on each element were characterized (i.e. mowing frequency
   and/or mowing period, inputs of herbicide and nitrogen fertilizers). We
   compared species diversity and taxonomic composition within and between
   elements. We tested the influence of management practices on (i) species
   richness and species evenness in each element, (ii) abundance-based
   compositional dissimilarity between pairs of elements using a model
   averaging procedure, and (iii) abundance of generalist species in field
   margins using generalized Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.
   ResultsCompositional dissimilarity between elements was mainly due to
   changes of dominant species. An early mowing of the berm increased berm
   species richness, while late mowing increased species richness of
   adjacent elements. An increase in embankment mowing frequency decreased
   species evenness in the embankment while input of herbicide on the
   embankment decreased the substitution rate between embankment and field
   margin. Finally, late mowing of the berm and one cut of the embankment
   both increased abundance of some generalist weeds in field margins.
   ConclusionsIn our agricultural landscape, mowing berms once in early
   summer is appropriate to promote plant species richness, while late
   mowing may potentially conflict with integrated weed management in
   adjacent arable fields. We suggest that programmes managing road verges
   should take into account the effects on plant assemblages within road
   verge elements and adjacent arable fields, as well as the potential
   increase in weed risk.}},

   Restoration outcomes of biodiversity and ecosystem services were

   on a cattle ranch with temperate forest remnants in the Mexican
   Transition Zone of central Mexico. Despite having similar species
   richness, the amount of dung removed by the beetle community on pastures
   was higher than in forest remnants, but there were no significant
   differences between dung types (cow and sheep). Using field mesocosms,
   we found differences in the amount of dung removed by eight of the most
   abundant species in the study area. As in the field, in the laboratory
   large species (Deltochilum scabriusculum Bates, Dichotomius colonicus
   Say, and Phanaeus adonis Harold) removed larger amounts of dung during
   the first days of the process. We found positive and significant

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1554-1564}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. The functional structure of plant communities can be altered by
   grazing through two main mechanisms: species turnover (i.e. changes in
   species occurrence and relative abundance) and intraspecific trait
   variability (ITV), which is driven by phenotypic responses of individual
   plants and shifts in the relative abundance of genotypic variants within
   species. Studies of grassland ecosystem function under grazing often
   focus on community changes induced by species turnover, which ignores
   the effects of ITV on biomass productivity, soil carbon or nutrient
   availability. By quantifying the relative contribution of both effects
   on shifts in community -wide traits, we highlight the role of ITV in
   community functional response to grazing and its implications for
   ecosystem function in Tibetan alpine meadows.
   2. We measured three chemical traits (LC: leaf carbon, LN: leaf nitrogen
   and LP: leaf phosphorus concentrations) and two morphological traits
   (SLA: specific leaf area, LDMC: leaf dry matter content) that are
   critical components of plant production and forage quality in grazed and
   ungrazed plots. Using variance decomposition of community-weighted means
   (CWM) for these foliar traits, we distinguished the relative importance
   of ITV vs. change in species occurrence and abundance in response to
   grazing and the associated changes in soil carbon and nutrient
   availability.
   3. The CWM for foliar nutrients and SLA(CWM) increased in response to
   grazing together with decreases in soil carbon and nutrient stores,
   especially LPCWM enrichment and loss of available soil P. The LPCWM was
   strongly negatively correlated with LDMCCWM, which was significantly
   higher in ungrazed plots. These community-wide trait responses to
   grazing were generally best captured by ITV and not changes in species
   occurrence and abundance, although ITV was consistently correlated with
   species turnover for all traits.
   4. Synthesis and applications. In response to continuous grazing, plants
   in Tibetan alpine meadows increase specific leaf area and foliar
   nutrients but tend to have lower leaf dry matter content, a response
   consistent with faster growth and regrowth under grazing. This
   intraspecific trait variability response drives a shift in community
   function from conservative, slow-growing resource use in ungrazed
   meadows to exploitative resource use under grazing. This community-wide
   functional response enhances forage quality, in turn favouring the
   secondary productivity of small herbivorous mammal communities, but also
   contributes to accelerated depletion of soil available phosphorus. We
   discuss the implications of these results for biodiversity conservation,
   ecosystem function and rangeland sustainability in the Qinghai Tibetan
   Plateau, especially with regard to managing grazing rotation to strike a
   balance between favouring secondary productivity of domesticated stock
   vs. small herbivorous mammals}},

Abstract = {{We compared the recovery of two plant communities over 14 years
   following a switch from spring to fall grazing (G), and in ungrazed
   exclosures (UG), at six sites in Lac du Bois Grasslands Provincial Park,
   British Columbia. Both communities showed similar large increases in
   cover of their respective dominant grasses - rough fescue (Festuca
   campestris), and bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata) - in
   both G and UG treatments. As expected, the more productive rough fescue
   community had higher amounts of soil polysaccharides, and total soil C
   and N. Repeated measures ANOVA indicated significant declines in species
   richness and Shannon diversity over time, especially in the ungrazed
   rough fescue community. Non-metric multidimensional scaling of species
   cover data showed continued divergence between communities, largely due
   to an increase in abundance of the two dominant grasses. Community
   differences were mainly determined by aspect and its impact on soil
   temperature and water content. We concluded that, from a management
   perspective, switching to light fall grazing was as effective as
   removing grazing to assist in recovery from previous overgrazing, and
   that the relationship of grazing combined with the fine-scale pattern of
   variable solar irradiance was responsible for the closely interspersed

Abstract = {{The practice of transhumance of livestock herds to Alpine summer pasture
   has experienced pronounced changes over recent decades due to the
   general process of agricultural intensification in productive areas and
   abandonment of farming in marginal areas. Instead of moving lactating
   cows to summer pastures raising replacement heifers recently gained much
   importance. Here, we analysed the impact of these changes in dairy
   farming on butterfly diversity inhabiting Alpine summer pastures in the
   eastern Italian Alps. We sampled butterflies (Lepidoptera) in 16 Alpine
   summer pastures that were either grazed by lactating cows (n = 11) or
   replacement heifers (n = 5) at two distances from the farm building.
   Butterflies Were classified according to their mobility. Our results
   showed a distance effect on total butterfly species richness only in
   pastures grazed by lactating cows indicating a stronger impact on
   vegetation structure and composition nearby the farm building. Abundance
   of butterflies was higher with increasing distance from the farm
   building. In contrast to mobile butterflies, sedentary species reacted
   more strongly to disturbance induced by grazing livestock. Moreover,
   butterfly composition differed slightly between pastures grazed by
   lactating cows and heifers. Our results indicate that the widespread
   adoption of heifer grazing induces a shift in butterfly diversity and
   composition likely caused by the different behaviour of grazing
   livestock. In order to benefit butterfly diversity in Alpine summer
   pastures, we suggest that future agri-environment schemes should provide
   extra support for summer farming of lactating cows. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) are widespread worldwide.
   Although weeds can result in several types of losses, essential
   information regarding weed seedling emergence and seed banks is lacking
   in these systems for integrated weed management planning. This study
   investigated the effects of different grazing intensities (no grazing
   and grazed swards maintained at 10-, 20-, 30- and 40-cm sward heights)
   on weed seedling emergence and seed banks in a winter cover crop during
   the 15th year of an ICLS experiment under no-tillage management in
   subtropical Southern Brazil. We hypothesized that low grazing
   intensities would reduce weed interference and weed seed banks size in
   an ICLS. We determined treatment- effects on weed species richness, seed
   bank population-density, and seedling emergence during winter and
   summer. Higher sward heights in the winter-grazed cover crop reduced the
   number of weed species, the density of emerged weed seedlings, and the
   weed seed bank size compared with the non-grazed control. With a sward
   grazing height of 10 cm, the seed bank contained an average of 3151
   seeds m-(2), and the weed population densities during the summer and
   winter were 11.8 and 21.7 plants m(-2) greater, respectively, compared
   with the sward grazing height of 40 cm. Fifteen years after adopting low
   grazing intensities (30- and 40-cm sward heights) in the ICLS, the size
   of the weed seed bank was reduced by 42.1\% compared with the non-grazed
   treatment. Decreasing the grazing intensity reduced the number of weed
   species, the density of emerged weed seedlings, and the weed seed bank
   density; therefore, integrated weed management strategies should
   consider minimizing grazing intensities in an ICLS. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent research shows that continuous overgrazing not only causes
   grassland biodiversity to decline, but also causes light fungal disease.
   Achnatherum inebrians is susceptible to fungal diseases and increases in
   prevalence during over grazing due its toxicity to livestock. This study
   aimed to examine the effects of A. inebrians on biological control
   organisms and levels of plant diseases in overgrazed grasslands in
   northwestern China. The results showed that A. inebrians plants were
   seriously infected by fungal diseases and that this led to a high
   incidence of the mycoparasitic species Ampelomyces quisqualis and
   Sphaerellopsis filum. In addition, the fungivore, Aleocharinae, was
   found only in the soil growing A. inebrians rather than in the
   overgrazed area without A. inebrians. Overall, in an overgrazed
   grassland fenced for one year, disease levels in blocks without A.
   inebrians were significantly higher than those in blocks with A.
   inebrians. Our findings indicated that the disease susceptible, toxic A.

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{218-226}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Delaying the first date of mowing of road verges is frequently practised
   as a way of preserving or enhancing biodiversity. Although the effects
   of this management practice on plant species richness remains
   controversial, it has been demonstrated that it allows more species to
   set seed. While an integrated management of the weed flora is currently
   promoted in arable fields adjacent to road verges, delaying the mowing
   of these field boundaries can be questioned, especially because seed
   dispersal from road verges to arable fields through field margins can be
   increased. In this context, the study aimed to assess the potential
   influence of delaying the first date of mowing of berms on (1) the
   species richness of berm standing vegetation (BSV), (2) the number of
   seeds and (3) the composition of seed rains in road verges and adjacent
   arable fields. To this end, we surveyed. the standing vegetation and
   seed rain in four areas, i.e. in the berm, embankment, crop edge and
   field margin from a total of 252 sampling points. First, we analysed the
   effect of the mowing period (i.e. early or late summer) on species
   richness of both BSV and berm seed rain. Then, at each sample point in
   the four areas, we studied the variation in (i) seed abundance (i.e.
   number of seeds), (ii) contribution of BSV to each seed rain (i.e.
   Sorensen's similarity and Bray-Curtis' dissimilarity indices between the
   BSV and each sample point) and (iii) seed abundance of the most frequent
   species recorded in BSV.
   Our findings showed that delaying the first mowing to late summer for
   four years had no impact on the species richness of BSV, while it
   increased species number and abundance of seeds in the berm seed rain.
   We also demonstrated that BSV of the late mown berms contributed more to
   the berm seed rain, than that of early mown berms. Moreover, our results
   suggest that compared to early mowing, only Dactylis glomerata dispersed
   more seeds from the late mown berms to field margins. Regarding the most
   frequent weed species observed in the BSV, for example Elytrigia repens,
   Arrhenatherum elatius and Convolvulus arvensis, the number of seeds
   trapped in field margins was low except for A. elatius. Finally, under
   our conditions, late mowing remained inefficient in promoting plant
   species richness on berms, but did not represent a particular factor of
   weed risk in field margins. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary forest landscapes in boreal and temperate environments,
   harvested by clear-cutting, contain various novel types of open spaces
   which are potentially suitable for species inhabiting natural or
   semi-natural open habitats. However, systematic analyses identifying the
   share of the regional species pool that can take advantage of this
   opportunity are missing. We assessed the importance of such forest
   openings for open-habitat butterflies in Estonia in Northern Europe by
   comparing butterfly species richness and composition in forest
   clear-cuts with their regional species pool. The species richness of
   butterflies in clear-cuts appeared to be remarkably high: we recorded
   altogether 81\% of the total regional species pool across the study
   sites. Clear-cuts were inhabited by a very high share (79\%) of
   regionally occurring grassland species, as well as nearly complete sets
   of open-habitat generalists and forest species. Redundancy analysis
   showed that clear-cuts in forests with different environmental
   characteristics harbour distinct butterfly assemblages, their
   contribution to the butterfly fauna in forest landscapes being thus
   complementary. This as well as several other lines of evidence indicate
   that most butterfly species can form resident populations in harvested
   forest landscapes. Our findings demonstrate that considering novel types
   of forest openings as `temporary meadows' can substantially improve the
   conservation prospects for butterflies and other organisms that have
   traditionally been considered to inhabit grasslands and other open
   habitats in agricultural landscapes. Human-altered ecosystems may thus
   prove to be a viable alternative where restoring or maintaining natural
   and semi-natural habitats is impossible. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The effect of land-use changes on plant diversity is an important issue,
   as plant diversity is vital to maintaining of threatened insect
   diversity in agro-ecosystems. Although many studies have examined
   patterns of a few threatened species, few studies have examined a large
   number of threatened species while comparing organisms of different
   trophic levels. Observed and expected community assembly patterns of
   common and threatened species should be evaluated along land-use
   gradients in agro-ecosystems, using species richness and red list
   indicator (RLI). This study examined local and regional diversity of
   plants and herbivorous insects among abandoned, traditional, and
   intensified land-use types in semi-natural grasslands and compared
   observed and expected values via null model analysis. This study showed
   that the richness and RH of plants and herbivorous insects were
   maintained in the traditional land-use. However threatened plants and
   herbivorous insects at sites of land abandonment and intensified use
   were significant lower than null model expectations. Although, plant
   richness, rather than RLI, was responsible for maintaining richness and
   the RLIs of herbivorous insects, plant richness did not linearly
   correlate with plant RLIs. Threatened plants did not depend on plant
   richness, it will be vital to identify and conserve unique environments
   for diversity of plants and herbivores. In conclusion, we should
   reintroduce traditional land-use practices in intensified use and
   abandoned grasslands. National and local governmental support for the
   appropriate management of semi-natural grasslands is beneficial for
   biodiversity conservation at both the local (e.g., present study area)

Abstract = {{Microsite and propagule limitation are predicted to jointly influence
   plant community assembly and diversity, with shifts in their relative
   contributions under different ecological conditions. Mammalian herbivory
   can also exhibit strong impact on community assembly and diversity.
   However, to date few studies have considered how herbivory might
   interact with propagule and microsite limitation and how herbivory might
   alter their relative importance. Even fewer studies have examined how
   these processes manifest over time to influence community assembly. In
   fenced and grazed tundra communities that varied in soil moisture, we
   manipulated propagule limitation by adding seeds of 14 species and
   manipulated microsite limitation through a one-time disturbance
   treatment which reduced resident community biomass. We then followed
   these communities for 11years to assess the long-term impacts of these
   processes on community assembly and richness. Herbivory interacted with
   soil moisture to promote long-term establishment of seeded species: seed
   addition increased species richness and this effect persisted over
   11years but only in grazed plots, and in drier conditions. Seed addition
   and herbivory also interacted to drive community composition.
   Disturbance initially resulted in greater richness and community
   divergence, but the effect weakened over time, whereas the effects of
   herbivory in general strengthened.Synthesis. Our results show that
   herbivory interacts with environmental conditions to mediate the
   relative importance of microsite and propagule limitation on community
   assembly; however, its impacts may only become detectable over longer
   time-scales. Moreover, our results suggest that herbivory may be a key
   biotic modulator of community assembly in low-productivity ecosystems
   and that incorporating trophic interactions (such as herbivory) into
   hypotheses about community assembly may provide a better understanding
   of the relative importance of different assembly mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{In Europe, agri-environment schemes (ALS) have been implemented to
   counteract the effects of agricultural intensification. Studies
   investigating the role of management improvement induced by AES are
   quite numerous, but rarely take into account the effect of natural

   known to shape community structure, Here we investigated the relative
   importance of management improvement and flooding to explain community
   parameters of two dominant arthropod groups and vegetation in alluvial
   meadows.
   Sampling took place in 2013, using suction samplers for arthropods and
   phytosociological releves for vegetation, in 83 meadows distributed
   along 200 km of the Loire Valley (France). Pair-matched approach (by
   R-ANOVA) was used to assess overall effects of AES whereas a gradient
   analysis (GLM) was carried out to assess the impact of AES prescriptions
   (fertilisation and cutting-date) together with indirect (long-term) and
   direct (short-term) effects of flooding.
   No significant effect of AES was found on arthropod and plant
   assemblages, abundance/productivity or diversity (both alpha and beta),
   but the number of rare plant species was higher in sites under AES.
   Prescriptions had little impact on most response variables considered;
   the only significant impact being the positive effect of high-amounts of
   fertilisers on spider alpha- and beta-diversities, Conversely,
   systematic long-term effects of flooding were found on all response
   variables of spiders, carabids and plants, underlining the key role of
   this factor in alluvial meadows, Our study demonstrates that maintaining
   or enhancing hydrological functioning of ecosystems is even more
   important than regulating both the cutting-dates and the low input of

Abstract = {{Reducing grazing intensity is widely recommended as a strategy to
   increase grassland biodiversity through greater sward heterogeneity.
   Horses are playing an increasing role in the management of permanent
   grasslands across Europe, but the effects of horse grazing under
   contrasting stocking rates have been poorly studied. Here we describe
   the effects of two contrasted stocking rates ({''}High{''} 1.8 LU ha(-1)
   vs. ``Moderate{''} 1.1 LU ha(-1)) on sward structure, horse foraging
   behaviour and performances, and pasture biodiversity in a mesophile
   grassland of central France. Horses selectively grazed vegetative
   patches of high nutritive value, especially at the moderate stocking
   rate (p < 0.01). This enabled them to maintain diet quality (diet dry
   matter digestibility: 59\% DM) and performances (daily liveweight gain >
   270 g animal(-1) d(-1)) at the same level in highly and moderately
   grazed plots despite contrasted herbage biomass and quality. Horses,
   with their two sets of incisors, created and maintained patches of short
   grass in a matrix of tall vegetation in both treatments. Consequently,
   sward structural heterogeneity did not significantly differ between
   highly and moderately grazed plots, and there was no detectable effect
   of grazing intensity on floristic and arthropod diversity over the
   four-year study. The two stocking rates did however result in a
   divergent evolution of legumes for which abundance increased at the high
   stocking rate (p < 0.05). Abundance of Carabidae and grasshoppers from
   tall grasslands was higher at the moderate stocking rate (p < 0.05). We
   conclude that decreasing stocking rate would only have a marginal effect
   on grassland biodiversity, while farm performance will be strongly
   affected by the decrease in the number of horses per unit area. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Native perennial grasslands have been proposed as a source of feedstocks
   for the production of second-generation lignocellulosic biofuels in the
   Midwestern USA. Although the consequences of some management decisions
   for biomass production and plant community composition are well
   understood (e.g. fertilization), less is known about the effects of
   harvesting frequency. We compared a once-and twice-annual harvesting
   regime at two restored prairies in southwestern Michigan established
   with identical seed mixtures as part of a large-scale bioenergy
   experiment. We determined biomass production and species composition in
   experimental plots and also measured the availability of light,
   inorganic nitrogen and soil moisture. The plant communities that
   established at the two sites differed markedly in composition and there
   was little evidence of convergence after five years. At the site
   dominated by warm-season C-4 grasses, single harvests generally produced
   more biomass than double harvests. By contrast, biomass production was
   unaffected by harvesting at the more diverse site. Contrary to our
   prediction that a summer harvest would increase diversity, we found
   small and subtle effects on plant community composition. This may be due
   in part to the timing of our harvest treatment. Our results suggest that
   a single, end-of-season harvest is the best practice for maximizing
   biomass production in prairies, especially at sites where warm-season
   grasses dominate. However, at more diverse sites, two harvests can
   produce the same total biomass and may support other beneficial
   ecosystem services. This study indicates that in the short term, double
   harvests are unlikely to affect plant species diversity or community

Abstract = {{Herbivore effects on diversity and succession were often studied in

   gastropod exclusion experiment testing for grazing effects on epiphytic
   cryptogam communities. We estimated the grazing damage, cover and
   diversity of cryptogams before gastropods were excluded and three and
   six years thereafter. Gastropod herbivory pronouncedly affected
   cryptogams, except for bryophytes, strongly depending on host tree
   species and duration of gastropod exclusion. On control trees, gastropod
   grazing regulated the growth of algae and non-lichenized fungi and
   thereby maintained a high lichen diversity and cover. On European beech,
   the release from gastropod grazing temporarily increased lichen
   vitality, cover, and species richness, but later caused rapid succession
   where algae and fungi overgrew lichens and thereby reduced their cover
   and diversity compared with the control. On Norway spruce, without
   gastropods lichen richness decreased and lichen cover increased compared
   with the control. Our findings highlight the importance of long-term
   exclusion experiments to disentangle short-term, direct effects from

Abstract = {{Rangelands occupy more than 80\% of the agricultural land in Kyrgyzstan.
   At least 30\% of Kyrgyz pasture areas are considered to be subject to
   vegetation and soil degradation. Since animal husbandry is the economic
   basis to sustain people's livelihoods, rangeland degradation presents a
   threat for the majority of the population. We present for the first time
   an ecological assessment of different pasture types in a remote area of
   the Naryn Oblast, using vegetation and soils as indicators of rangeland
   conditions. We analysed the current degree of utilization (grazing
   pressure), the amount of biomass, soil samples, and vegetation data,
   using cluster analysis as well as ordination techniques. Winter pastures
   (kyshtoo) are characterized by higher pH values (average of 7.27) and
   lower organic matter contents (average of 12.83\%) compared to summer
   pastures (dzailoo) with average pH values of 6.03 and average organic
   matter contents of 21.05\%. Additionally, summer pastures show higher
   above-ground biomass, and higher species richness and diversity. Our
   results support the hypothesis that winter pastures, which are located
   near settlements, suffer from over-utilisation, while the more distant
   summer pastures are subjected to much lower grazing pressure.}},

Abstract = {{Our aim was to investigate the influence of seed dispersal via sheep and
   goats on the biodiversity of the characteristic plant community and
   endangered plant species in near-coastal dry grasslands. We examined
   epi- and endozoochory by sheep and goats, grazing with a shepherd in a
   protected dry grassland area in northern Germany. We recorded the
   species and density of seeds trapped in fur and excreted in faeces of
   sheep and goats. These two ungulates dispersed seeds of 44\% of all the
   species from the study site, These included seeds from 31 locally
   endangered plant species. The diversity and number of seeds were higher
   in fur and faeces of sheep compared to goats. This pattern was also
   found for the occurrence of seeds from plants characteristic to this
   habitat and Red List species. Extrapolation of these observations to the
   whole Pock of sheep (n = 630) and goats (n = 20) suggests that there are
   about 357,000 seed transported in the fur whereas up to 1,500,000 seeds
   are dispersed via endozoochory. These observations underline the
   importance of free-ranging sheep and goats in shaping the biodiversity

Title = {{Power-line corridors as source habitat for butterflies in forest
   landscapes}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{201}},
Pages = {{320-326}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Modern intensified agriculture has decreased farmland heterogeneity,
   which has led to strong negative effects on farmland biodiversity.
   However, partly forested landscapes seem to offer many alternative
   habitats for open habitat species such as butterflies, since modern
   forestry and development of infrastructure has created several new
   environments such as forest road verges and power-line corridors. The
   aim of the present study was to investigate the importance of power-line
   corridors (PLCs) as butterfly habitats by testing i) if species richness
   and abundance of butterflies in PLCs are affected by adjacent habitat
   composition (i.e. comparisons of PLCs with different adjacent habitats),
   ii) if PLCs act as source habitat through spill-over of individuals into
   adjacent forest roads and semi-natural pastures and iii) if species
   composition differs among the investigated habitat types. To investigate
   this we censured the butterfly fauna in 23 study landscapes in
   south-central Sweden. We found support for the hypothesis that PLCs may
   act as source habitats for butterflies in forest roads and pastures,
   since species richness and abundance were decreasing with increasing
   distance to PLC from 0 to 500 m. In addition, the species composition in
   forest roads and pastures close to and far from PLCs was similar,
   suggesting that this increase was not due to an increase of PLC
   specialists in the other two habitats. Thus, we have shown that PLCs in
   themselves are important butterfly habitats independently of adjacent
   habitat composition (adjacent mature forest, clear cuts or arable land),
   and they contribute to increased species richness and abundance of
   butterflies in surrounding areas over 10 times larger than their own
   width. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread land degradation has strengthened the urgent need to restore
   overgrazing grasslands. China has implemented the program Returning
   Grazing Land to Grassland' (RGLG) through grazing exclusion by fence
   since 2003. Despite a lot of field experiments, there is still
   controversy on the effects of grazing exclusion on rangeland
   restoration, highlighting the need for synthetic analysis. We conducted
   a meta analysis of 447 entries from 78 papers to analyze the
   spatiotemporal effects of grazing exclusion on plant diversity,
   productivity and soil carbon sequestration in the major RGLG-implemented
   provinces of China. Our results showed that, compared with the grazed
   sites, grazing exclusion significantly increased carbon stored in
   aboveground biomass, litter mass, belowground biomass and soils by
   84.7\%, 111.6\%, 25.5\% and 14.4\%, respectively. Plant coverage, soil
   available nitrogen, soil available phosphorus and soil microbial biomass
   carbon increased by 52.0\%, 21.7\% 22.8\% and 26.3\%, respectively.
   However, grazing exclusion had little effects on recovering plant
   diversity in China's grasslands. Of the factors examined, climatic
   factors strongly modified the effects of grazing exclusion on ecosystem
   carbon stocks, for example, precipitation significantly amplified the
   positive effects. Grazing exclusion played a positive role in soil
   carbon sequestration in most grassland types except in temperate
   desert-steppe. But annual soil carbon sequestration rates decayed
   rapidly over time in both alpine meadow and temperate steppe. Short-term
   (<5 years) grazing exclusion remarkably increased species richness, but
   not significantly in the long run. The threshold from neutral to
   negative effects of grazing exclusion on species evenness occurs after
   approximately ten years. Our findings provide evidence that grazing
   exclusion is an effective way to restore vegetation and sequestrate
   carbon in degraded grasslands, but not beneficial to plant diversity
   maintenance. The benefits of grazing exclusion are more effective in
   humid area than arid area. We suggest that grazing exclusion should be
   ceased after about six to ten years. Additionally, grazing exclusion
   should integrate with other appropriate management practices instead of
   operating on a stand-alone basis. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Winners and losers in a long-term study of vegetation change at Moor
   House NNR: Effects of sheep-grazing and its removal on British upland
   vegetation}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{89-101}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We analysed data collected between 1954 and 2000 from nine long-term
   experiments designed to assess the effects of sheep-grazing versus
   no-sheep-grazing at Moor House NNR, an Environmental Change Network
   site. The experiments were set up between 1954 and 1972 across a range
   of vegetation types typical of much of upland Britain. Data from this
   type of experiment are often difficult to analyse and we describe the
   procedures undertaken to prepare the data for analysis. We fitted the
   resultant data to the British National Vegetation Classification and
   used ordination techniques to assess the relative positions of the
   experiments to each other. Finally, we used Generalized Linear
   Mixed-effects Modelling within a Bayesian framework to model change of
   species taxonomic/physiognomic groups through time in both sheep-grazed
   and ungrazed treatments across all nine experiments; variables included
   species diversity, Shannon-Weiner index and derived data on occurrence
   and abundance of species groups based on taxonomy and physiognomy.
   Hurdle analysis was used to model the species groups; this analysis
   separated the change through time in both probability of occurrence
   (binomial distribution) and abundance (Poisson distribution).
   In the sheep-grazed plots (the ``business-as-usual{''} treatment hence
   here designated the ``control{''}) there was a reduction in species
   diversity and a decrease in abundance of vascular plants, grasses,
   lichens, liverworts and mosses; whereas herbs, sedges and shrubs
   increased. When probability of occurrence was considered, there was a
   reduction in number of presences of both lichens and liverworts. Thus,
   the status quo management of continuous sheep-grazing, even though
   reduced since 1972, has resulted in a marked change in species
   composition of these plant communities, with some winners and some
   losers, but overall they support the concept of biotic homogenization.
   It is likely that some of these changes were driven by external factors
   such as elevated atmospheric nutrient deposition. Removal of sheep
   grazing had some positive benefits; with the herbs, mosses, sedges and
   shrubs increasing, but faster reductions in grasses and liverworts.
   Sedges + rushes were stable. It suggested that future monitoring schemes
   might use either the probability of occurrence of liverworts and
   lichens, or the abundance of lichens, liverworts, grasses and mosses as
   sensitive indicators of change in upland Britain.
   Moreover, during the period that Moor House has been protected as a
   nature reserve some key plant species groups have declined in spite of
   reductions in grazing pressure. To reverse this trend requires some form
   of interventionist management. In order to increase the diversity of
   vascular plants some form of disturbance will probably be needed, but
   for bryophytes and lichens this remains a research question. If the
   results from these small-scale experiments are replicated at the
   landscape scale a reduction of sheep grazing pressure, for example in
   rewilding schemes, will have little effect on species composition over a
   28-44 year period. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Brazilian Caatinga is one of the most diverse dryland ecosystem of the
   world and is threatened by strong land use pressure and poor protection.
   In this study, we investigate the effects of past and present land use
   on plant community richness and structure. We used satellite information
   to identify 55 Caatinga forest plots with and without past vegetation
   clearing. We also quantified current land use, i.e. grazing by domestic
   animals, and selective logging. Caatinga vegetation structure, measured
   as vegetation cover, vegetation height, basal area and woody plant
   density, as well as recruitment, measured as woody plant seedling
   density and species richness, were negatively affected by both past and
   current land use. Past clear-cut not only had strong effects on most
   vegetation measures, but also increased current grazing which further
   negatively affected vegetation structure. Selective logging had little
   measurable effects but increased recruitment in plots previously
   clear-cut. Increasing time since the last clear-cut increased negative
   effects on vegetation, presumably because of a prolonged negative effect
   of grazing. Our results suggest that grazing needs to be prevented in
   areas degraded by clear-cut to allow vegetation restoration through
   natural succession and avoid further degradation and desertification.

Number = {{7618}},
Pages = {{93-96}},
Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Niche dimensionality provides a general theoretical explanation for
   biodiversity-more niches, defined by more limiting factors, allow for
   more ways that species can coexist(1). Because plant species compete for
   the same set of limiting resources, theory predicts that addition of a
   limiting resource eliminates potential trade-offs, reducing the number
   of species that can coexist(2). Multiple nutrient limitation of plant
   production is common and therefore fertilization may reduce diversity by
   reducing the number or dimensionality of belowground limiting factors.
   At the same time, nutrient addition, by increasing biomass, should
   ultimately shift competition from belowground nutrients towards a
   one-dimensional competitive trade-off for light(3). Here we show that
   plant species diversity decreased when a greater number of limiting
   nutrients were added across 45 grassland sites from a multi-continent
   experimental network(4). The number of added nutrients predicted
   diversity loss, even after controlling for effects of plant biomass, and
   even where biomass production was not nutrient-limited. We found that
   elevated resource supply reduced niche dimensionality and diversity and
   increased both productivity(5) and compositional turnover. Our results
   point to the importance of understanding dimensionality in ecological
   systems that are undergoing diversity loss in response to multiple
   global change factors.}},

Abstract = {{The Campos grasslands of southern South America have been affected by
   long-term livestock grazing and increasingly widespread afforestation,
   but the effects of multiple disturbances have not been well studied,
   especially at multiple spatiotemporal scales. To determine vegetation
   response to these disturbances, we constructed grazing exclosures
   bisecting the forest-grassland ecotone at five sites and measured
   species richness in nested plots for four treatments (grazed forest,
   ungrazed forest, grazed grassland, and ungrazed grassland) over 18
   months. Species-area curves revealed greater small-scale species
   richness in grasslands than forests but greater rates of species
   accumulation in forests and thus little difference in richness between
   habitats at larger scales. Temporally, small-scale richness differed
   among sample dates, but rates of species accumulation did not. The
   interactive effect of habitat and management on total species richness
   varied with times since the exclosures were built. Grazing and
   afforestation interactively affect the vegetation of the Campos, as
   plants respond to changes in both disturbances; over the duration of
   this study, the removal of grazing decreased species richness in
   grasslands but increased richness in forests. Our results illustrate
   that the response of plant species richness to grazing and afforestation
   varies by the nature of the disturbance mechanism, and that multiple
   disturbances have complex interactive effects on vegetative responses.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of submerged macrophytes in eutrophic shallow freshwater
   ecosystems is rarely undertaken without additional measures to improve
   water clarity. Increasing water clarity is extremely difficult to
   achieve in some eutrophic waters, so this study trialled the
   establishment of macrophytes directly into a turbid,
   phytoplankton-dominated system. The submerged macrophyte Vallisneria
   australis grew successfully in five 48-m(2) protective exclosures, from
   transplants attached to steel mesh for anchorage in flocculent
   sediments. Plant growth, water quality, and zooplankton and
   macroinvertebrate richness and abundance were measured and compared with
   open water control plots throughout the growing season. V. australis
   grew well despite poor water quality (total phosphorus 44-1400 A mu g
   l(-1); total nitrogen 650-14,000 A mu g l(-1); chlorophyll a 1.6-770 A
   mu g l(-1); turbidity 3-207 NTU), attaining 85-100\% cover after 6
   months. Water quality was not improved within macrophyte meadows and
   zooplankton grazing was not enhanced. Richness and abundance of
   macroinvertebrates increased and additional native macrophyte species
   colonised the exclosures. Co-dominance of phytoplankton and macrophytes
   was achieved in exclosures, with beneficial outcomes for biodiversity.
   Rapid destruction of macrophyte meadows by waterbirds on removal of
   protective cages indicated the need for continued protection for
   long-term establishment of submerged macrophytes.}},

Abstract = {{Many experiments have shown that loss of biodiversity reduces the
   capacity of ecosystems to provide the multiple services on which humans
   depend(1,2). However, experiments necessarily simplify the complexity of
   natural ecosystems and will normally control for other important drivers
   of ecosystem functioning, such as the environment or land use. In
   addition, existing studies typically focus on the diversity of single
   trophic groups, neglecting the fact that biodiversity loss occurs across
   many taxa(3,4) and that the functional effects of any trophic group may
   depend on the abundance and diversity of others(5,6). Here we report
   analysis of the relationships between the species richness and abundance
   of nine trophic groups, including 4,600 above-and below-ground taxa, and
   14 ecosystem services and functions and with their simultaneous
   provision (or multifunctionality) in 150 grasslands. We show that high
   species richness in multiple trophic groups (multitrophic richness) had
   stronger positive effects on ecosystem services than richness in any
   individual trophic group; this includes plant species richness, the most
   widely used measure of biodiversity. On average, three trophic groups
   influenced each ecosystem service, with each trophic group influencing
   at least one service. Multitrophic richness was particularly beneficial
   for `regulating' and `cultural' services, and for multifunctionality,
   whereas a change in the total abundance of species or biomass in
   multiple trophic groups (the multitrophic abundance) positively affected
   supporting services. Multitrophic richness and abundance drove ecosystem
   functioning as strongly as abiotic conditions and land-use intensity,
   extending previous experimental results(7,8) to real-world ecosystems.
   Primary producers, herbivorous insects and microbial decomposers seem to
   be particularly important drivers of ecosystem functioning, as shown by
   the strong and frequent positive associations of their richness or
   abundance with multiple ecosystem services. Our results show that
   multitrophic richness and abundance support ecosystem functioning, and
   demonstrate that a focus on single groups has led to researchers to
   greatly underestimate the functional importance of biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Small mammals play important roles in many ecosystems, and understanding
   their response to disturbances such as cattle grazing is fundamental for
   developing sustainable land use strategies. However, how small mammals
   respond to cattle grazing remains controversial. A potential cause is
   that most of previous studies adopt rather simple experimental designs
   based solely on the presence/absence of grazing, and are thus unable to
   detect any complex relationships between diversity and grazing
   intensity. In this study, we conducted manipulated experiments in the
   Hulunber meadow steppe to survey small mammal community structures under
   four levels of grazing intensities. We found dramatic changes in species
   composition in native small mammal communities when grazing intensity
   reached intermediate levels (0.46 animal unit/ha). As grazing intensity
   increased, Spermophilus dauricus gradually became the single dominant
   species. Species richness and diversity of small mammals in ungrazed and
   lightly grazed (0.23 animal unit/ha) area were much higher than in
   intermediately and heavily grazed area. We did not detect a humped
   relationship between small mammal diversity and disturbance levels
   predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH). Our study
   highlighted the necessity of conducting manipulated experiments under
   multiple grazing intensities.}},

Abstract = {{With steadily shrinking areas of species-rich semi-natural grasslands in
   Europe, the management of the remaining fragments becomes ever more
   crucial for the preservation of key elements of biodiversity in the
   agricultural landscape. Detailed knowledge about species-wise, as well
   as group-wise, relationships can provide guidelines for conservation
   management and a basis for predictions about different management
   scenarios. In the present study, we related the occurrence of species of
   bumblebees (N = 12), butterflies (31) and day-flying moths (4) and their
   total richness in 424 sites in southern Sweden to three grass sward
   attributes, (i) flower abundance, (ii) height of the grass sward and
   (iii) within-site variation in height of vegetation. The abundance of
   nectar-bearing flowers proved overall the best predictor of richness and
   in most of the occurrence-based species-wise models. However, both high
   grass sward height and high variation in grass sward height contributed
   significantly to species richness and occurrence of individual species.
   There was a tendency for bumblebees to respond less positively to flower
   abundance and vegetation height than butterflies and moths. One
   expectation was that grassland specialists, red-listed species, or
   species decreasing in other part of Europe, would be more responsive to
   tall vegetation or flower abundance but there was no support for this in
   the data. Hence, management strategies that promote common species will
   also benefit all, or most of, the rare ones as well. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{230}},
Pages = {{210-220}},

Abstract = {{A major challenge in tropical human-modified landscapes (HMLs) is
   meeting the ever-growing demand for agricultural products while
   conserving biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by forest
   ecosystems. Within this challenge, a major issue is the understanding of
   the forest potential to naturally regenerate in abandoned agricultural
   fields. To assess such potential, it is necessary to know the diversity
   of agricultural land uses in the landscape, quantify the ecological
   disturbance inflicted by such uses, and evaluate forest regeneration as
   a function of disturbance both at the field and landscape levels. Our
   previous work has shown that in abandoned fields the abundance and
   species diversity of regenerating rain forest trees decline as
   disturbance level increases. Here we aimed to achieve the following: 1)
   to quantify the diversity of agricultural land uses in HMLs; 2) to
   assess ecological disturbance regimes caused by different agricultural
   land uses, at the field and landscape scales; and 3) to identify groups
   of agricultural land uses with contrasting effects for forest
   regeneration at the landscape level. We approach these issues by using a
   case study of HMLs in a southeastern region of Mexico, which are
   representative of landscapes in the agricultural frontier in the
   Neotropics. We interviewed 68 landowners to gather information on
   agricultural land uses and management of 156 fields. Based on this
   information, we quantified an ecological disturbance regime associated
   with each field considering the following: field size (in hectares),
   duration of agricultural use (in years), and land-use disturbance
   severity (i.e. frequency or magnitude of fire, agrochemicals, machinery,
   grazing or removal of tree cover). By integrating disturbance inflicted
   by different land uses and the proportion of the landscape covered by
   each land use, we constructed a landscape ecological disturbance index.
   Finally, by using this index and data gathered from nine landscapes (3 x
   3 km each), we tested the hypothesis that structural attributes
   (abundance, biomass, and species diversity of trees) of regenerating
   forests decrease as agriculture disturbances increase in the landscape.
   There was a high inequality in the proportion of land allocated to the
   13 recorded agricultural land uses, with cattle pastures representing
   ca. 90\% of total agricultural land. There was a wide disturbance
   gradient, ranging from land uses with high (e.g. cattle pastures) to low
   disturbance (e.g. coffee and cocoa plantations). Three major groups of
   land uses with contrasting disturbance regimes were detected: 1)
   agroforestry systems, characterized by small size, low to intermediate
   duration, and low disturbance severity; 2) monocultures, typically small
   size, long duration, and medium to high disturbance severity; and 3)
   extensive farming, large size, short to intermediate duration, and high
   disturbance severity. Biomass and species diversity of regenerating
   forests consistently reduced with increasing levels of agriculture
   disturbance in the landscape. We conclude that positive balances between
   biodiversity conservation and agricultural production in HMLs will
   depend on establishing agricultural land uses that inflict low
   disturbance regimes (such as agroforestry systems) embedded in a matrix
   of old-growth forest and long-lasting second-growth forests. Our results
   may inform farmers, policy makers and land managers about HMLs where
   agricultural production and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem
   services can be conciliated. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Invertebrates are the main components of faunal diversity in grasslands,
   playing substantial roles in ecosystem processes including nutrient
   cycling and pollination. Grassland invertebrate communities are heavily
   dependent on the plant diversity and production within a given system.
   Climate change models predict alterations in precipitation patterns,
   both in terms of the amount of total inputs and the frequency,
   seasonality and intensity with which these inputs occur, which will
   impact grassland productivity. Given the ecological, economic and
   biodiversity value of grasslands, and their importance globally as areas
   of carbon storage and agricultural development, it is in our interest to
   understand how predicted alterations in precipitation patterns will
   affect grasslands and the invertebrate communities they contain. Here,
   we review the findings from manipulative and observational studies which
   have examined invertebrate responses to altered rainfall, with a
   particular focus on large-scale field experiments employing
   precipitation manipulations. Given the tight associations between
   invertebrate communities and their underlying plant communities,
   invertebrate responses to altered precipitation generally mirror those
   of the plants in the system. However, there is evidence that species
   responses to future precipitation changes will be idiosyncratic and
   context dependent across trophic levels, challenging our ability to make
   reliable predictions about how grassland communities will respond to
   future climatic changes, without further investigation. Thus, moving
   forward, we recommend increased consideration of invertebrate
   communities in current and future rainfall manipulation platforms, as
   well as the adoption of new technologies to aid such studies.}},

Abstract = {{Pastoralism is rarely viewed as a major future form of land use, because
   of well documented cases of rangeland degradation, attributed to
   irrational overstocking by pastoralists, and the subsequent losses of
   ecosystem services. However, pastoralists were actually encouraged to
   settle and adopt such strategies, copied from rangelands with higher and
   more reliable rainfall. This curtailed mobility resulted in a shift from
   opportunistic and extensive land use to more intensive and settled forms
   of use. The purpose of this review is to examine the link between
   pastoralism and the provision of ecosystem services by rangelands,
   focusing on biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration.
   Pastoralists employ several techniques to manage rangeland resources,
   including mobility, herding, corralling, grazing reserves and the use of
   fire. With these strategies, pastoralists have contributed to the
   enhancement of rangeland biodiversity and the long-term conservation of
   important wildlife habitats. Pastoralists also possess detailed
   knowledge of rangeland plants and their uses, which could be valuable in
   the assessment, conservation and utilisation of rangeland biodiversity.
   Similarly, traditional pastoral rangeland management practices, such as
   the use of seasonal grassland reserves and livestock mobility, influence
   vegetation composition, coverage and abundance in rangelands and offer
   tools for biomass and soil carbon restoration, contributing to the
   mitigation of climate change.
   However, various internal and external factors have curtailed
   traditional management practices and livestock mobility, breaking the
   co-evolved balance of vegetation, wildlife and land use, thus exposing
   rangeland to continued livestock pressure, which often leads to
   degradation. Rather than abandoning pastoralism, the revitalisation of
   traditional practices and indigenous knowledge is vital to secure
   sustainable livelihoods for millions of pastoralists and to maintain
   rangeland biodiversity and ecosystem services.}},

   invasive annual bromes in the Northern Great Plains}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Two Eurasian invasive annual brome grasses, cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum)
   and Japanese brome (Bromus japonicus), are well known for their impact
   in steppe ecosystems of the western United States where these grasses
   have altered fire regimes, reduced native plant diversity and abundance,
   and degraded wildlife habitat. Annual bromes are also abundant in the
   grasslands of the Northern Great Plains (NGP), but their impact and
   ecology are not as well studied. It is unclear whether the lessons
   learned from the steppe will translate to the mixed-grass prairie where
   native plant species are adapted to frequent fires and grazing.
   Developing a successful annual brome management strategy for National
   Park Service units and other NGP grasslands requires better
   understanding of (1) the impact of annual bromes on grassland condition;
   (2) the dynamics of these species through space and time; and (3) the
   relative importance of environmental factors within and outside
   managers' control for these spatiotemporal dynamics. Here, we use
   vegetation monitoring data collected from 1998 to 2015 in 295 sites to
   relate spatiotemporal variability of annual brome grasses to grassland
   composition, weather, physical environmental characteristics, and
   ecological processes (grazing and fire). Concern about the impact of
   these species in NGP grasslands is warranted, as we found a decline in
   native species richness with increasing annual brome cover. Annual brome
   cover generally increased over the time of monitoring but also displayed
   a 3- to 5-yr cycle of reduction and resurgence. Relative cover of annual
   bromes in the monitored areas was best predicted by park unit, weather,
   extant plant community, slope grade, soil composition, and fire history.
   We found no evidence that grazing reduced annual brome cover, but this
   may be due to the relatively low grazing pressure in our study. By
   understanding the consequences and patterns of annual brome invasion, we
   will be better able to preserve and restore these grassland landscapes
   for future generations.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing is an important management action to conserve biodiversity in
   semi-natural grasslands but it is important to understand how grazing
   influences the life-history components and population dynamics of plant
   species. In this study, we analysed effects of grazing intensity and
   abandonment on population dynamics of the semi-natural grassland species
   Knautia arvensis which is an important nectar source for pollinating
   species and an indicator of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes. We
   recorded life-history stage, survival, establishment of seedlings and
   ramets, number of inflorescences and grazing marks on permanently marked
   individuals in eight populations in mid-Norway for three consecutive
   years. Matrix modelling was used to estimate population growth rates and
   elasticities, and life Table response experiments (LTREs) were used to
   assess the contribution of different life-history components to the
   observed variation in population growth rates between different
   management treatments. Generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs)
   were used to investigate the effect of management on vital rates and
   number of inflorescences as well as damage to K. arvensis individuals.
   Populations in abandoned grasslands had more inflorescences, a lower
   proportion of seedlings and a higher proportion of flowering ramets
   compared to populations in grasslands under high grazing intensity.
   There were no differences in population growth rates between different
   grazing intensities. Fecundity however, contributed more to the growth
   rate in grazed grasslands compared to abandoned grasslands where clonal
   regeneration contributed the most. Survival of non-flowering rosettes
   made the largest impact to overall growth rates. Our results indicate
   that a long life-span and clonal growth buffer the effect of
   environmental change in abandoned grasslands and that there is a
   trade-off between fertility and clonal regeneration in K. arvensis
   populations. (C) 2016 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier GmbH.}},

   interviews, after an initial satellite data analysis. Grazing and herd
   size were found to increase with increasing elevation, reflecting local
   livelihood dependency on cattle herding. Species richness was then
   analyzed along a grazing disturbance gradient at 7 goths (summer cattle
   shed) in heavily grazed areas. Disturbance was found to be moderate at
   intermediate distances, where species richness was found to be higher;
   the results agree with the generally accepted intermediate-disturbance
   hypothesis. The plant species not affected, even at the locations with
   highest grazing, were unpalatable species. These results can be useful
   in decision making related to management of forests and pastures in the
   Manaslu Conservation Area as well as in Himalayan forests and grasslands

Abstract = {{Field margins have considerable ecological significance in
   agriculture-dominated landscapes by supporting biodiversity and
   associated services. However, agricultural changes during mid-20th
   century led to their drastic loss with a serious threat for
   biodiversity. Using time-series data, we aimed to get better insights
   into processes underlying plant patterns of field margins through time
   by i) quantifying plant temporal beta diversity components, ii)
   assessing whether the observed changes in plant communities can be
   related to changes in management practices applied to field margins.
   During the springs of 1994, 1998 and 2001, we surveyed plant communities
   and management practices of the same 116 field margins in three
   contrasted landscapes. We estimated temporal beta diversity in plant
   communities and partitioned it into its two dissimilarity resultant
   components, accounting for replacement of species (i.e. turnover) and
   for the nested gain or loss of species (i.e. nestedness). We then tested
   whether the observed changes in plant communities between 1994 and 1998
   and, between 1998 and 2001 were related to changes in management
   practices using linear models. Plant communities of field margins
   exhibited strong temporal beta diversity dominated by turnover. Temporal
   turnover in plant communities was partly related to changes in
   management practices, i.e., a decrease of grazing concomitant to an
   increase of herbicide spraying. However, relationships were not
   consistent between all landscape contexts nor time period, suggesting
   that other unmeasured deterministic or stochastic processes could be
   driving the observed plant patterns. Taken together, our results suggest
   that maintaining a wide diversity of field margins with contrasted
   management contribute to maintaining plant diversity at a landscape
   scale. They underline the value of investigating plant temporal
   diversity patterns using time series data and thus, the need to develop
   long-term studies making it possible to understand ecological processes
   shaping plant communities in agricultural landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The savannas of Southern Africa are an important dryland ecosystem as
   they cover up to 54\% of the landscape and support a rich variety of
   biodiversity. This paper evaluates landscape change in savanna
   vegetation along Chobe Riverfront within Chobe National Park Botswana,
   from 1982 to 2011 to understand what change may be occurring in land
   cover. Classifying land cover in savanna environments is challenging
   because the vegetation spectral signatures are similar across distinct
   vegetation covers. With vegetation species and even structural groups
   having similar signatures in multispectral imagery difficulties exist in
   making discrete classifications in such landscapes. To address this
   issue, a Random Forest classification algorithm was applied to predict
   land-cover classes. Additionally, time series vegetation indices were
   used to support the findings of the discrete land cover classification.
   Results indicate that a landscape level vegetation shift has occurred
   across the Chobe Riverfront, with results highlighting a shift in land
   cover towards more woody vegetation. This represents a degradation of
   vegetation cover within this savanna landscape environment, largely due
   to an increasing number of elephants and other herbivores utilizing the
   Riverfront. The forested area along roads at a further distance from the
   River has also had a loss of percent cover. The continuous analysis
   during 1982-2011, utilizing monthly AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution
   Radiometer) NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values, also
   verifies this change in amount of vegetation is a continuous and ongoing
   process in this region. This study provides land use planners and
   managers with a more reliable, efficient and relatively inexpensive tool
   for analyzing land-cover change across these highly sensitive regions,
   and highlights the usefulness of a Random Forest classification in
   conjunction with time series analysis for monitoring savanna landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging conservation paradigms have shifted from single to
   multi-species approaches focused on sustaining biodiversity.
   Multi-species hierarchical occupancy modelling provides a method for
   assessing biodiversity while accounting for multiple sources of
   uncertainty. We analysed camera trapping data with multi-species models
   using a Bayesian approach to estimate the distributions of a terrestrial
   mammal community in northern Botswana and evaluate community, group, and
   species-specific responses to human disturbance and environmental
   variables. Groupings were based on two life-history traits: body size
   (small, medium, large and extra-large) and diet (carnivore, omnivore and
   herbivore). We photographed 44 species of mammals over 6607 trap nights.
   Camera station-specific estimates of species richness ranged from 8 to
   27 unique species, and species had a mean occurrence probability of
   0<bold></bold>32 (95\% credible
   interval=0<bold></bold>21-0<bold></bold>45). At the community level, our
   model revealed species richness was generally greatest in floodplains
   and grasslands and with increasing distances into protected wildlife
   areas. Variation among species' responses was explained in part by our
   species groupings. The positive influence of protected areas was
   strongest for extra-large species and herbivores, while medium-sized
   species actually increased in the non-protected areas. The positive
   effect of grassland/floodplain cover, alternatively, was strongest for
   large species and carnivores and weakest for small species and
   herbivores, suggesting herbivore diversity is promoted by habitat
   heterogeneity.Synthesis and applications. Our results highlight the
   importance of protected areas and grasslands in maintaining biodiversity
   in southern Africa. We demonstrate the utility of hierarchical Bayesian
   models for assessing community, group and individual species' responses
   to anthropogenic and environmental variables. This framework can be used
   to map areas of high conservation value and predict impacts of land-use
   change. Our approach is particularly applicable to the growing number of
   camera trap studies world-wide, and we suggest broader application
   globally will likely result in reduced costs, improved efficiency and
   increased knowledge of wildlife communities.}},

Abstract = {{The Mediterranean basin is considered one of the most important
   biodiversity hotspots. This extraordinary richness originates mainly
   from thousands of years of human activities that deeply modified the
   landscape. Safeguarding the so-called cultural landscapes plays a key
   role in biodiversity conservation. In this paper we present the results
   of our monitoring of the effects of the life project ``Preservation of
   mountain grasslands of the Tuscan Apennines{''}, mainly characterized by
   shrub-cutting actions, on bird populations in the Pratomagno pasture,
   one of the two areas where the project was implemented, a SPA in eastern
   Tuscany. The monitoring plan covers a period of 5 years. We tested the
   effects of shrub clearing on a series of bird community parameters, such
   as abundance and richness of common species and of some ecological
   guilds. We also tested the timing of the response to the interventions
   (immediate or drawn out over time). Our results show a dramatic decrease
   of birds associated with shrubland, while there were no important
   increases in grassland species, with the sole exception of Woodlark.
   Regardless of their positive or negative effects, our results show
   different response times for individual species or groups of species.
   Moreover, species with a bad regional conservation status increased less
   than those with a good one. Broadly speaking, these results suggest that
   the efficacy of such projects depends on a careful preliminary
   assessment of a number of aspects, encompassing the nature of the
   interventions themselves and the characteristics of the target sites,
   but also the type of response of target species and the conservation
   status of target populations.}},

Abstract = {{Little information is available on relationships between pest animal
   density and damage in natural ecosystems. Introduced European rabbits,
   Oryctolagus cuniculus, cause severe damage to Australian native
   vegetation but density-damage relationships are largely unexplored.
   There are no recognized simple methods to estimate their impacts on
   native pastures, due in part to confusion with grazing impact of other
   herbivores. We tested simple quantitative sampling methods using
   multiple small quadrats to detect site differences in pasture cover,
   pasture species richness and dung pellet density of herbivores, from
   which rabbit density and relative abundance of larger herbivores were
   estimated. Native pasture cover and species richness declined
   exponentially with increasing rabbit density, within the range of 0-5
   rabbits ha(-1), while cover of unpalatable exotic pasture species
   increased. By contrast, kangaroo abundance was positively related to
   palatable native pasture cover and negatively related to cover of
   unpalatable weeds, and had no negative effect on native pasture cover or
   species richness that was discernable against a background of low to
   moderate rabbit densities. Perennial native forbs and perennial grasses
   replaced invasive Wards weed as the dominant ground cover at low rabbit
   densities. We conclude that, regardless of previous grazing history,
   contemporary kangaroo grazing pressure and weed invasion, the severely
   degraded state of native pastures was perpetuated by rabbits. The effect
   of rabbits on native pasture can be recorded in a simple manner that is
   suitable for identifying density-damage relationships in the presence of
   other herbivores and changes over time. This method is seen as
   particularly useful in setting target densities below which rabbits must
   be managed to maintain native plant communities and ecosystem function
   in southern Australia. It may also be useful to demonstrate rabbits'
   impacts in other regions, including optimum densities for plant
   biodiversity benefits in their native European range.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{55-65}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Three restoration strategies on agricultural fields with acid sandy soil
   were evaluated after 18 and 25 years: conversion to heathland, rangeland
   and forest. Changes in soil microstructure, chemical characteristics,
   availability of N and P, and vegetation composition were analyzed in
   agricultural soils, three undisturbed reference sites and five types of
   restored former agricultural fields.
   Agricultural soils were characterized by organic slurry without much
   soil life. Soil nutrients were especially high for P, mostly in mineral
   form, and P-desorption rates were high. Partial and complete topsoil
   removal, aiming at heathland restoration, led to (much) lower soil
   organic matter and nutrients, but not to recovery of soil life, nor to
   P-limited soils. Heather was accompanied by many grassland species, even
   with complete topsoil removal. Conversion to rangeland did not decrease
   nutrient stocks, but led to improved soil life, although different from
   reference grasslands due to the higher pH. P-availability remained high,
   but net N-mineralization and plant N-content were clearly lower after 25
   than after 18 years. Plant diversity was relatively high, and cover of
   eutrophic grasses decreased to 8-39\% in intermediate and productive
   rangelands. Nutrient-poor species remained absent, but the slightly
   higher pH improved conditions for many grassland herbs. Afforestation
   did also not lead to nutrient-poor conditions, but soil life clearly
   increased and nutrients were used for rapid tree growth. Undergrowth
   species however remained eutrophic.
   It was impossible to retrieve the P-limited reference ecosystems within
   25 years of restoration, not even with complete topsoil removal.
   Differences in plant diversity between expensive topsoil removal and
   much cheaper conversion to rangeland were also relatively small. For
   restoration on a landscape scale, it may thus be better to focus on
   conversion to semi-natural grasslands and afforestation. The half open,
   nutrient-, mineral-, and species-rich landscape offers opportunities for
   large grazers, but also for many insects and birds. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Habitat heterogeneity is a key driver of biodiversity in many
   ecosystems. Wildlife inhabiting the native prairies of North America
   evolved in a heterogeneous mosaic of habitat conditions created by fire
   and grazing by native ungulates. Current rangeland management practices
   in the tallgrass prairie ecosystem evenly distribute fire and grazing
   across management units and promote homogeneous habitat conditions.
   Patch-burn grazing is a rangeland management strategy that seeks to
   restore heterogeneity to rangelands via fire-grazing interactions. Our
   3.5-year study tested the effects of patch-burn grazing on habitat
   heterogeneity and small mammal community dynamics in the Flint Hills
   ecoregion of eastern Kansas. To study the ecological effects of
   patch-burn grazing, we sampled habitat conditions and the small mammal
   community. We assessed habitat conditions once each growing season in a
   negative control that was annually burned and grazed, a positive control
   that was burned every four years and ungrazed, and within each of three
   units of a patch-burn grazing experiment (PBG) managed with rotational
   fire. Habitat conditions were significantly different among treatments,
   and a principal components analysis showed that the patch-burn grazing
   treatment had higher canopy cover of forbs and habitat heterogeneity
   than our two control units. To sample the small mammal community, we
   conducted monthly live trapping of small mammals on two randomly located
   trap grids in each of our two controls and three units of our PBG
   treatment. Small mammal diversity was significantly higher in the
   patch-burn grazing treatment and in the positive control, vs. the
   negative control. Moreover, a canonical correspondence analysis showed
   that a fire-grazing interaction was the major driver structuring small
   mammal communities. Patch-burn grazing is an effective strategy for
   restoring heterogeneity to vegetative structure and composition, and can
   increase-biodiversity of small mammals in managed rangelands in the

Abstract = {{Animals move to interact with the environment in order to find food
   resources and cover. Intrinsic characteristics affecting feeding and
   antipredatory strategies likely shape variation in movement patterns and
   home range formation between individuals, populations and species.
   Browsing herbivores selectively forage on patchily distributed resources
   in areas with more canopy cover, whereas mixed feeders and grazers feed
   on more open grasslands and tend to aggregate as an antipredatory
   strategy. We therefore predicted that at small temporal scales, browsers
   will show greater net displacements (i.e. typical of searching patterns)
   than mixed feeders or grazers; but at larger temporal scales, we expect
   the opposite pattern, since gregarious species will need to use larger
   areas to feed the whole herd. We also predicted that the
   feeding/antipredatory strategy will determine the behavioural responses
   to other environmental factors. To test this, we compared spatial
   movement patterns at multiple scales (from 20-min intervals to annual
   home ranges) of three sympatric, similar-sized, alpine ungulates which
   differ in their feeding/antipredatory strategy: roe deer (solitary
   browsers), mouflon (gregarious grazers) and chamois (intermediate
   feeders in smaller groups). We used location data from GPS-collared
   females of the three species in the French Alps. As predicted, we found
   that multi-scale spatial patterns depended on the feeding/antipredatory
   strategy. Browsers foraged within smaller range areas, searching back
   and forth. Mixed feeders and, especially, grazers covered larger areas,
   presumably to satisfy herd needs. The feeding/antipredatory strategies
   also determined the interspecific variability in behavioural responses
   to factors such as maternal status, weather, habitat type or human
   disturbance, supporting our hypothesis. Exploring interspecific
   variability, we showed how movement behaviour and home range formation
   vary substantially, even among species within the same guild. This
   mechanism might be important to maintain intra-guild multi-species
   associations and increase biodiversity, through contributing to niche

Abstract = {{Grasslands world-wide provide a host of ecosystem services. In
   particular, these grasslands serve as biodiversity repositories for a
   myriad of imperilled animal species. One such group is grassland birds,
   which have experienced significant declines, predominantly caused by
   extensive loss and degradation of native grasslands. Rangeland
   management that promotes increasing and sustaining livestock production
   through reducing the inherent, disturbance-driven variability that
   historically occurred in grasslands is considered a major contributing
   factor to these declines. An alternative approach to this homogeneous
   management paradigm attempts to restore a shifting mosaic of disturbance
   patches across the landscape through the spatial and temporal
   interactions of fire and grazing (i.e. pyric herbivory). Application of
   pyric herbivory through patch-burn grazing increases overall habitat
   heterogeneity, likely a critically important factor in maintaining and
   enhancing grassland bird populations. We compared reproductive rates and
   estimates of fecundity of three grassland birds nesting in grasslands
   maintained by traditional and patch-burn grazing management paradigms in
   the Southern Great Plains of North America. Additionally, we used a
   sensitivity analysis approach to assess population stability (i.e. =1)
   and source-sink population dynamics under the two management practices.
   Nest survival for dickcissels Spiza americana and grasshopper sparrows
   Ammodramus savannarum was higher in patch-burned grasslands than in
   traditionally managed grasslands, while nest survival for eastern
   meadowlarks Sturnella magna was higher in traditionally managed
   grasslands than in patch-burned grasslands. Dickcissels and grasshopper
   sparrows responded positively to patch burning with source habitats
   occurring over a wider range of survival rates under patch burning than
   traditional management, while no clear pattern emerged in source-sink
   dynamics of eastern meadowlarks.Synthesis and applications. Management
   strategies such as patch-burn grazing offer opportunities to restore
   landscape heterogeneity to benefit bird communities while maintaining
   livestock production goals. Applying patch-burn grazing to rangelands
   can increase productivity of grassland birds and could be effective for
   reversing the decline of grassland birds by providing source habitats
   more consistently than traditional rangeland management. Our results
   emphasize the utility of using sensitivity analyses to determine
   source-sink population dynamics when evaluating management practices.
   However, land managers should consider that source-sink models have
   shortcomings and designation of a habitat as a sink does not necessarily
   mean the habitat has low conservation value.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to analyze the effects of habitat loss and
   forest replacement by cattle pasture on the alpha and beta diversity,

   different dispersal ability. Dung beetles were captured in 19 forest
   fragments and neighbouring pastures. Forest fragment area ranged from
   3.7 to 4825 ha and in this study were grouped into four categories:
   small, medium, large and control forest. A total of 35,048 dung beetles
   representing 101 species were collected. Forest fragments had the
   highest richness with 81 species, followed by pasture with 58 species.
   Replacement of forest by pasture reduced species richness; however, due
   to the proximity and connectivity of these areas with Cerrado patches,
   pastures also had high species richness, but species composition was
   independent of adjacent fragments. Small fragments had lower abundance
   and species richness than our other habitat categories, even pastures.
   Our results highlight that proximity and connectivity with Cerrado areas
   influenced the patterns of alpha and beta diversity of dung beetles in
   fragments and pastures. We highlight that the ability to cross the
   pasture matrix is a strong adaptive trait for species living in
   human-modified landscapes. Consequently, species with these abilities
   are less susceptible to the effects of forest fragmentation and local
   extinction. Our results reinforce the importance of considering the

   grazed grassland (CGG) as a control site. Plant species cover and soil
   were sampled during summer (June-July) 2008. Soil physicochemical
   properties were analyzed. Low similarity index of an early succession
   stage, CA2, with CGG was associated with abundant P and coarse sand. The
   proportion of coarse sand was not abundant in middle stage (CA9) because
   of domination by perennial rhizomatous species. In the later stage
   (CA18), the fine sand proportion did not increase; however, the dominant
   species were associated with fine sand in CGG. The results suggest the
   limiting factors of recovery processes in abandoned Mongolian cropland
   are abundantly available P and coarse sand at an early succession stage
   (CA2). The small proportion of fine sand in CA18 indicated that the
   impacts of cropping in Mongolia persist for a long time. Published by

Abstract = {{Alnus glutinosa (alder) swamp woodlands are in danger of disappearing in
   Europe and, in Norway, several habitats with alder are threatened.
   Knowledge about the dynamics of alder swamp woodlands is crucial for the
   conservation and management of this vegetation. Our studied site,
   Rambjora, in western Norway encompasses the Rambjara Landscape Protected
   Area. We combined information from three sources recent alder swamp
   woodland ecology, vegetation history, and agricultural history to reveal
   the long-term vegetation dynamics of Rambjora in relation to land-use.
   Dynamic changes in the predominance of forest or semi-natural grassland
   over 2800 years, concurrent with varying anthropogenic disturbances are
   inferred. At the investigated site, alder swamp woodland developed after
   forest clearance and changes in the water balance. The abundance of
   alder swamp woodlands have varied through time, increasing with
   low-impact land-use and declining with intensified use or abandonment.
   The highest biodiversity is found in periods with grazing, hay mowing,
   and probably fodder and fire wood collection. This indicates that
   agricultural practices of moderate intensity (grazing and hay cutting)
   should be part of the future management in order to maintain the
   biodiversity and meet the objective of the protection of Rambjora. The
   study demonstrates the advantages of combining vegetation surveys,
   pollen records, and land-use history to provide a long-term perspective
   on vegetation development, and in our case also as an aid when
   establishing conservation strategies. Our findings need to be considered
   in future conservation and restoration of ecosystems with alder swamp

Abstract = {{Background: The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is home to the vast
   grassland in China. The QTP grassland ecosystem has beenseriously
   degraded by human land use practices and climate change. Fertilization
   is used in this region to increase vegetation yields for grazers. The
   impact of long-term fertilization on plant and microbial communities has
   been studied extensively. However, the influence of short-term
   fertilization on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF) communities in the
   QTP is largely unknown, despite their important functional role in
   grassland ecosystems.
   Methods: We investigated AMF community responses to three years of N
   and/or P addition at an experimental field site on the QTP, using the
   Illumina MiSeq platform (PE 300).
   Results: Fertilization resulted in a dramatic shift in AMF community
   composition and NP addition significantly increased AMF species richness
   and phylogen diversity. Aboveground biomass, available phosphorus, and
   NO3- were significantly correlated with changes in AMF community
   structure. Changes in these factors were driven by fertilization
   treatments. Thus, fertilization had a large impact on AMF communities,
   mediated by changes in aboveground productivity and soil chemistry.
   Discussion: Prior work has shown how plants often lower their reliance
   on AMF symbioses following fertilization, leading to decrease AMF
   abundance and diversity,. However, our study reports a rise in AMF
   diversity with fertilization treatment. Because AMF can provide stress
   tolerance to their hosts, we suggest that extreme weather on the QTP may
   help drive a positive relationship between fertilizer amendment and AMF
   diversity.}},

Title = {{Roles of Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi and Soil Abiotic Conditions in the
   Establishment of a Dry Grassland Community}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The importance of soil biota in the composition of mature plant
   communities is commonly acknowledged. In contrast, the role of soil
   biota in the early establishment of new plant communities and their
   relative importance for soil abiotic conditions are still poorly
   understood.
   Aims and Methods
   The aim of this study was to understand the effects of soil origin and
   soil fungal communities on the composition of a newly established dry
   grassland plant community. We used soil from two different origins (dry
   grassland and abandoned field) with different pH and nutrient and
   mineral content. Grassland microcosms were established by sowing seeds
   of 54 species of dry grassland plants into the studied soils. To
   suppress soil fungi, half of the pots were regularly treated with
   fungicide. In this way, we studied the independent and combined effects
   of soil origin and soil community on the establishment of dry grassland
   communities.
   Key Results
   The effect of suppressing the soil fungal community on the richness and
   composition of the plant communities was much stronger than the effect
   of soil origin. Contrary to our expectations, the effects of these two
   factors were largely additive, indicating the same degree of importance
   of soil fungal communities in the establishment of species-rich plant
   communities in the soils from both origins. The negative effect of
   suppressing soil fungi on species richness, however, occurred later in
   the soil from the abandoned field than in the soil from the grassland.
   This result likely occurred because the negative effects of the
   suppression of fungi in the field soil were caused mainly by changes in
   plant community composition and increased competition. In contrast, in
   the grassland soil, the absence of soil fungi was limiting for plants
   already at the early stages of their establishment, i.e., in the phases
   of germination and early recruitment. While fungicide affects not only
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi but also other biota, our data indicate
   that changes in the AMF communities are the most likely drivers of the
   observed changes. The effects of other soil biota, however, cannot be
   fully excluded.
   Conclusions
   These results suggest that the availability of soil fungi may not be the
   most important limiting factor for the establishment of grassland
   species in abandoned fields if we manage to reduce the intensity of
   competition at these sites e.g., by mowing or grazing.}},

Abstract = {{The need to control exotic grasses in areas of ecological restoration
   for long periods is followed by high economical costs of application,
   collateral damage on regeneration and other less obvious environmental
   harms. Thus, it is necessary estimate such drawbacks in order to
   evaluate the cost/benefit rate of the application of these techniques.
   This study aimed to assess the damage caused by two control techniques
   of Guinea-grass (Megathyrsus maximus (Jacq.) B. K Simon \& S. W. L.
   Jacobs), on pre-existing regeneration (environmental costs) in a 20-year
   reforestation site and estimate the economic costs of employing such
   techniques. Thirty 10 x 20m plots were divided into three groups: (CON)
   control, (ROC) mowing (using gas-powered brush cutters) and (HERB)
   mowing followed by the application of a glyphosate-based herbicide. We
   did a permanent inventory of all tree and shrub individuals, who were
   followed over a period of one year. No differences were found in
   mortality imposed by the initial mowing, neither in the mortality
   imposed exclusively by mowing nor in the mortality imposed exclusively
   by herbicide in HERB. After one year, there were no differences between
   mortality and species richness of the three groups. However, when the
   three groups were compared with themselves after one year, for plants >
   1 m, we found a reduction on abundance in CON and reduction in species
   richness in HERB; whereas for plants < 1 m, ROC showed a reduction in
   abundance and HERB showed reduced abundance and species richness.
   Therefore, both techniques seem to affect more plants < 1 m (i. e.,
   regeneration). The final economic cost of ROC was 34.1\% bigger than the
   cost of HERB, and in spite of a likely reduction in costs to perform new
   interventions, proportional costs increased for scattered interventions
   over small areas. Both techniques were efficient to control
   Guinea-grass, but the use of glyphosate-based herbicide should be
   restricted to areas with low canopy cover, more maintenance-demanding
   sites, once the technique is more damaging on regeneration, since there
   was high mortality (73\%) of individuals < 1 m in areas with dense grass
   infestation (100\%).}},

   increased with distance from hydric resources, and abundance with

   simplified species assemblages. Habitat selection was detected in all

Abstract = {{To evaluate the floristic sustainability of three small, isolated
   tallgrass prairie remnants, spatial and temporal patterns of species and

   from 1.29 ha to 1.77 ha; each is bordered by cropland and unmanaged or
   mowed ruderal grassland. A stratified sampling design was established
   using permanently marked transects oriented perpendicular to the long
   axis of each site. Vegetation data were collected in 50 cm X 50 cm
   quadrats along each transect; prairies were resampled 5-6 yr following
   baseline data collection. The null expectations were no differences
   between edge and interior zones, no differences between edge type (crop

Abstract = {{Question: The encroachment of woody species has been globally reported
   over much of arid and semi-arid biomes, and has been associated with a
   decrease in cover and number of herbaceous species. How does the
   encroachment of a woody shrub affect herbaceous community structure and
   species composition in grasslands of a wetland ecosystem?
   Location: Seasonally flooded grasslands in a Neotropical Hyperseasonal
   Savanna, the Pantanal wetland, Brazil.
   Methods: We investigated the effect of the encroaching plant Combretum
   laxum on a herbaceous community from seasonally flooded grasslands in
   the Pantanal wetland using 29 vegetation samples representing
   encroachment at different spatio-temporal stages. The point quadrat
   method was used to acquire vegetation data, as plant cover, species
   richness (S) and Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'). We evaluated the
   existence of stages of encroachment related to differences in vegetation
   structure and species composition using non-metric multidimensional
   scaling ordination and analysis of similarity. The response of the
   herbaceous community to shrub advance was analysed using linear and
   quadratic polynomial regression models. Model fitness was tested using
   the ACI.
   Results: The advance of the woody encroaching plant C. laxum over the
   seasonally flooded grassland occurs in three stages: grassland stage,
   shrub islands stage and shrubland stage. The initial advance of C. laxum
   over the grassland, represented by the shrub islands stage was
   correlated to an increase in species richness and a decrease in
   important native forage grasses. Critical changes in the herbaceous
   community were observed when the encroaching plant covered > 30\% of the
   periodically flooded grassland, when the richness of herbaceous species
   dropped from 22 to four.
   Conclusions: Woody encroachment causes impoverishment and simplification
   of the herbaceous community. The shift from a grass-to a shrub-dominated
   state is related to the reduction in important grassland-obligate
   species, forage resources for herbivore livestock and wild animals,
   affecting the ecological dynamics and the economy of rangelands.
   Conservation of these grassland ecosystems depends on rangeland
   management practices guided by scientific knowledge on the causes and

Abstract = {{Questions: While mowing is a viable management tool for the maintenance
   of diversity in grasslands, the suitability of mowing in grasslands with
   invasion by exotic plants is poorly understood. In this 18-yr study, we
   investigate the effects of long-term mowing on a tallgrass prairie
   community invaded by exotic yellow bluestem (Bothriochloa ischaemum;
   BOIS). We explore the influence of BOIS on species richness and
   composition in the face of different mowing treatments as well as
   monitoring any post-treatment legacy effects.
   Location: Northeast central Oklahoma, US.
   Methods: A total of 144 permanent plots were laid out comprising eight
   treatments (i.e. all combinations of Mar, Jun and Sept, mows resulting
   in three single mows, three double mows, one triple mow and an un-mowed
   control). Plots were mowed 1996-2011 and recovery was monitored through
   2014. Repeated mixed model ANOVA, PERMANOVA and principal response
   curves were employed to analyse species richness and compositional
   changes from mowing. Correlation was used to explore the effects of BOIS
   on species richness.
   Results: Mowing resulted in higher species richness relative to the
   absence of mowing, with the highest levels being sustained in the late
   season mown plots throughout the study. Once mowing had ceased, early
   season mown plots declined in species richness down to the same levels
   as the un-mown plots, concomitant with the sharpest increased cover of
   BOIS in these plots relative to all other treatments. Overall, we found
   a strong negative correlation between BOIS cover and species richness.
   Species dissimilarity was highest between any plot that was mowed and
   the un-mown controls, as well as between March and September only
   treatments.
   Conclusions: Our study highlights the potential of mowing in maintaining
   high species richness. However, the positive response to early season
   mowing of the exotic yellow bluestem and ensuing negative effect on
   species richness suggests that BOIS can confound the favourable effects
   of mowing. We found only minor post-treatment legacy effects, since BOIS
   strongly re-established in the absence of mowing in all previously mown
   plots, especially the early season mown plots. Thus, we recommend
   sustained late season mowing to help control the spread of BOIS and
   maintain species-rich grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: What is the effect of a range of controlled stocking rates on

   Location: Subtropical grasslands of Corrientes, Argentina, South
   America.
   Methods: We studied the effect of three controlled stocking rates (0.6,
   0.8 and 1.0 cow equivalents.ha(-1)) on species diversity and composition
   during 8 yr. We calculated species diversity using the antilog of the
   Shannon-Wiener index, and considered its two components, richness and
   evenness. We also assessed the proportion of prostrate and erect
   species. Species abundance was based on biomass estimations.
   Results: Species diversity under high stocking rates gradually decreased
   throughout the experiment and became nearly 50\% lower than under low
   stocking rate. This decline was largely accounted for by changes of
   evenness because species richness was not affected by stocking rates.
   Species composition clearly diverged among the three treatments over
   time. Low stocking rate-maintained a fairly constant relative cover of
   erect and prostrate grasses throughout the experiment, whereas
   intermediate and high stocking rate treatments were gradually and
   consistently enriched in prostrate grasses and forbs. These effects
   occurred simultaneously with drastic inter-annual changes likely driven
   by annual precipitation.
   Conclusions: The range of stocking rates had no effect on species
   richness, but reduced diversity through the effect on evenness. High
   stocking rate progressively increased the proportion of prostrate

Abstract = {{Direct implications of landscape management measures, such as clearing
   and grubbing, on snails are only sparsely published. Thus the impact of
   management on two xerothermophilous terrestrial gastropod species,
   Zebrina detrita and Caucasotachea vindobonensis, and on land snails in
   general, was evaluated in the vineyard area of northern Vienna. This
   area belongs to the buffer zone of UNESCO Wienerwald Biosphere Reserve
   in Austria. A total of 18 sites were investigated, including vineyard
   embankments and dry meadows with different intensity levels of clearing
   and grubbing in recent years. Occurrence of both target species and
   their ability to recolonize newly created habitats were assessed. Snails
   are able to colonize new areas in direct vicinity of existing
   populations that are above detection level. Only annually repeated
   clearing of meadows and embankments with originally strong shrub
   coverage resulted in a visible effect. Continuous clearing efforts over
   10 years were associated with a dense population of Z. detrita on a
   formerly unsuited bush-covered meadow. In contrast, vineyard embankments
   that were cut free just once within two years before the study harboured
   only a few specimens of Z. detrita. Also the former occurrence of empty
   shells of grassland species should be taken into consideration when
   planning landscape management, because they can provide information on
   the potential success of restoring open grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Campylopus introflexus is an invasive alien moss in Europe and North

   considered as a successful pioneer invader on cutaway peatlands with
   minor impacts on vegetation diversity or particular native species and

Abstract = {{Ungulates are leading drivers of plant communities worldwide, with
   impacts linked to animal density, disturbance and vegetation structure,

   species; however, few studies have specifically examined the combined
   effects of two or more species on plant communities. We examined the
   extent to which two ungulate browsers (moose {[}Alces americanus]) and
   white-tailed deer {[}Odocoileus virginianus]) have additive
   (compounding) or compensatory (opposing) effects on herbaceous layer
   composition and diversity, 5-6 years after timber harvest in
   Massachusetts, USA. We established three combinations of ungulates using
   two types of fenced exclosures - none (full exclosure), deer (partial
   exclosure), and deer + moose (control) in six replicated blocks. Species
   composition diverged among browser treatments, and changes were
   generally additive. Plant assemblages characteristic of closed canopy
   forests were less abundant and assemblages characteristic of
   open/disturbed habitats were more abundant in deer + moose plots

   in greater herbaceous species richness at the plot scale (169 m(2)) and
   greater woody species richness at the subplot scale (1 m(2)) than
   ungulate exclusion and deer alone. Browsing by deer + moose resulted in
   strong changes to the composition, structure, and diversity of forest
   herbaceous layers, relative to areas free of ungulates and areas browed

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{1. Grasshoppers constitute a significant proportion of invertebrate
   diversity in grasslands, but little is known about how fire and grazing,
   two of the main drivers of grassland dynamics, influence them.
   2. Here, we determine how these disturbances influence grasshopper
   diversity in remnant grassland ecological networks (ENs) among
   commercial forestry compartments in Afromontane grassland, South Africa.
   Sites differed in fire frequency (annual vs. longer rotation burning),
   time since last fire (< 12 months vs. > 12 months ago), and presence or
   absence of domestic cattle grazing. Reference sites were in an adjacent
   protected area (PA). We also recorded bare ground, vegetation cover, and
   vegetation height.
   3. Grasshopper abundance significantly benefitted from annual burning,
   cattle grazing, short grass, and when the last fire was < 12 months
   prior to sampling.
   4. Fire frequency was the only disturbance with a significant effect on
   grasshopper species composition, but without significantly affecting
   species richness. In the PA, heterogeneity of dispersion was smaller in
   annually burned firebreaks than in sites with longer fire-return
   intervals, which points to homogenisation of resident grasshopper
   assemblages.
   5. Although most grasshopper species favoured recently burned or grazed
   grassland, some preferred low or no disturbance. This illustrates a
   considerable range of habitat preferences in the grasshopper assemblage.
   6. Management recommendation: Burning and grazing at moderate levels
   should be integral to local landscape management, as these impacts
   benefit grasshoppers in grassland ENs. Some areas should be left
   undisturbed to create a mosaic of different successional stages at the
   landscape spatial scale, providing diverse habitat for a wide range of
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The spatiotemporal interaction between fire and grazing was a key
   process in the development of North America's grasslands. Restoring
   interacting fire and grazing may be instrumental in conserving rangeland
   biodiversity, but a need exists to understand how it affects organisms
   in highly fragmented grassland landscapes. We examined nest survival of
   a species of conservation concern, the Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella
   magna), in fragmented Midwestern grasslands that varied in the spatial
   and temporal application of fire and grazing. The patch-burn grazed
   treatment (i.e., interacting fire and grazing) consisted of burning a
   different third of a pasture annually. Pastures in the grazed-and-burned
   treatment were burned in their entirety every third year and both
   treatments were moderately stocked with cattle. Average daily nest
   survival rates were similar across treatments (patch-burn grazed:
   incubation = 0.90 and nestling = 0.93, grazed-and-burned: incubation =
   0.90 and nestling = 0.92), but patch-burn grazing resulted in more
   stable survival rates from year to year, while the grazed-and-burned
   treatment appeared to create a boom and bust survival cycle (patch-burn
   grazed range = 12-16\%, grazed-and-burned range = 2-31\%). Models
   indicated a treatmentyear interaction, nest stage, and woody vegetation
   most affected the overall probability of nest survival. Nest survival
   was greatest in 2009 when grazed-and-burned pastures were burned but
   dropped dramatically the following year in that treatment. Nests had a
   higher probability of survival during the nestling stage (beta = 0.49,
   (SE) = 0.27), and woody vegetation near the nest resulted in lower
   survival (beta = -0.07, SE = 0.04). Parasitism rates were greater in
   grazed-and-burned pastures and reduced clutch sizes by an average of 0.6
   eggs but did not affect the number of chicks fledging per nest. Overall,
   our findings suggest restoring heterogeneity to fragmented grasslands
   through patch-burn grazing can positively affect Eastern Meadowlarks by
   stabilizing nest survival rates over time.}},

Abstract = {{Species-based ecological indices, such as Ellenberg indicators, reflect
   plant habitat preferences and can be used to describe local environment
   conditions. One disadvantage of using vegetation data as a substitute
   for environmental data is the fact that extensive floristic sampling can
   usually only be carried out at a plot scale within limited geographical
   areas. Remotely sensed data have the potential to provide information on
   fine-scale vegetation properties over large areas. In the present study,
   we examine whether airborne hyperspectral remote sensing can be used to
   predict Ellenberg nutrient (N) and moisture (M) values in plots in dry
   grazed grasslands within a local agricultural landscape in southern
   Sweden. We compare the prediction accuracy of three categories of model:
   (I) models based on predefined vegetation indices (VIs), (II) models
   based on waveband-selected VIs, and (III) models based on the full set
   of hyperspectral wavebands. We also identify the optimal combination of
   wavebands for the prediction of Ellenberg values. The floristic
   composition of 104 (4 m x 4 m grassland) plots on the Baltic island of
   Ol and was surveyed in the field, and the vascular plant species
   recorded in the plots were assigned Ellenberg indicator values for N and
   M. A community-weighted mean value was calculated for N (mN) and M (mM)
   within each plot. Hyperspectral data were extracted from an 8 m x 8 m
   pixel window centred on each plot. The relationship between
   field-observed and predicted mean Ellenberg values was significant for
   all three categories of prediction models. The performance of the
   category II and III models was comparable, and they gave lower
   prediction errors and higher R-2 values than the category I models for
   both mN and mM. Visible and near-infrared wavebands were important for
   the prediction of both mN and mM, and shortwave infrared wavebands were
   also important for the prediction of mM. We conclude that airborne
   hyperspectral remote sensing can detect spectral differences in
   vegetation between grassland plots characterised by different mean
   Ellenberg N and M values, and that remote sensing technology can
   potentially be used to survey fine-scale variation in environmental
   conditions within a local agricultural landscape. (C)2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{QuestionsWhat is the effect of grazing on seedling recruitment and
   seedling establishment? To what extent is grazing dependent on local
   habitat conditions?
   Locationesky Kras (Czech Karst), central Bohemia, Czech Republic.
   MethodsIn 2005, grazing was reintroduced on formerly grazed dry
   grassland. Twelve blocks of grazed and control plots were established.
   Seedlings of dicotyledonous plants were observed three times a year for
   4yrs, for a total of ten censuses. We tested the effects of grazing on
   seedling recruitment (entry of new individuals to the seedling stage) as
   well as seedling establishment (survival of seedlings for 1yr after
   initial emergence). In addition, we explored the effect of soil depth -
   the most important environmental variable at our study site - on
   seedling response to grazing. The effects of grazing, soil depth and
   season on seedling number in plots were tested with generalized mixed
   effect models with a Poisson distribution. The effect of grazing on
   species composition was tested with canonical correspondence analysis.
   ResultsGrazing had a significant positive effect on seedling
   recruitment. Grazing affected the number of seedlings and species
   composition and facilitated the presence of dry grassland species.
   Seedlings of xerophilous species were primarily found in grazed plots,
   while control plots contained species preferring higher, closed sward.
   Grazing explained only 1.2\% of the total variation in composition of
   recruited seedlings. We presume that the main factor determining species
   composition could be dispersal limitation. Grazing increased the number
   of recruited seedlings by 10.55\%. The final number of established
   seedlings was unaffected by grazing. Furthermore, the interaction of
   grazing with soil depth had a significant positive effect on seedling
   recruitment, thus showing that the effect of grazing strongly depends on
   habitat conditions at the specific microsite within our location.
   ConclusionsOur results indicate that predicting higher generative
   reproduction on pastures based on a larger number of seedlings may be
   misleading if the species are limited by establishment - but not
   recruitment - as at our study site. Furthermore, our findings show that
   varying habitat conditions on small spatial scales can modify the impact
   of management on seedling recruitment and establishment.}},

   Excessive grazing is one of the most negative anthropogenic ecological
   factors that have a great impact on biodiversity. A decrease in
   biological productivity of the communities and biodiversity occurs due
   to overgrazing, consequently leading to desertification. The semiarid
   zone of West Kazakhstan is one of the regions with particularly dramatic
   negative effects of livestock overgrazing on the ecosystems. Grazing
   pressure promoted pasture degradation in the region, bringing the
   pastures of sheep farms into the most critical state. There is an urgent
   matter of optimization of grazing pressure on the semiarid pasture
   ecosystems through the development of adaptive technologies for
   sustainable exploitation of pasture ecosystems, which should provide
   accelerated recovery and increased productivity of the ecosystems, and
   improve the environment of people in the semiarid regions of Kazakhstan.
   In the course of the studies, the contemporary state of the semiarid
   pasture lands has been determined. The results of the study prove the

Title = {{Towards evenly distributed grazing patterns: including social context in
   sheep management strategies}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Background. A large proportion of natural grasslands around the world is
   exposed to overgrazing resulting in land degradation and biodiversity
   loss. Although there is an increasing effort in the promotion of
   sustainable livestock management, rangeland degradation still occurs
   because animals' foraging behaviour is highly selective at different
   spatial scales. The assessment of the ecological mechanisms modulating
   the spatial distribution of grazing and how to control it has critical
   implications for long term conservation of resources and the
   sustainability of livestock production. Considering the relevance of
   social interactions on animals' space use patterns, our aim was to
   explore the potential effects of including animals' social context into
   management strategies using domestic sheep grazing in rangelands as case
   study.
   Methods. We used GPS data from 19 Merino sheep (approximately 10\% of
   the flock) grazing on three different paddocks (with sizes from 80 to
   1000 Ha) during a year, to estimate resource selection functions of
   sheep grazing in flocks of different levels of heterogeneity. We
   assessed the effects of sheep class (i.e., ewes, wethers, and hoggets),
   age, body condition and time since release on habitat selection
   patterns.
   Results. We found that social rank was reflected on sheep habitat use,
   where dominant individuals (i.e., reproductive females) used more
   intensively the most preferred areas and low-ranked (i.e., yearlings)
   used less preferred areas. Our results showed that when sheep grazed on
   more heterogeneous flocks, grazing patterns were more evenly distributed
   at all the paddocks considered in this study. On the other hand, when
   high-ranked individuals were removed from the flock, low-ranked sheep
   shifted their selection patterns by increasing the use of the most
   preferred areas and strongly avoided to use less preferred sites (i.e.,
   a highly selective grazing behaviour).
   Discussion. Although homogenization and segregation of flocks by classes
   are common practices to increase flock productivity, we are proposing an
   alternative that employs behavioural interactions in heterogeneous
   flocks to generate more evenly distributed grazing patterns. This
   practice can be combined with other practices such as rotational grazing
   and guardian dogs (to decrease mortality levels that may be generated by
   sheep grazing on more risky habitats). This does not imply any
   modifications of livestock stocking rates and densities or any
   additional investments for labour and materials. Considering livestock
   behaviour is critical for the design of sustainable management practices
   that balance landscape conservation and livestock productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Community dynamics is influenced by multiple ecological processes such
   as environmental spatio-temporal variation, competition between
   individuals and demographic stochasticity. Quantifying the respective
   influence of these various processes and making predictions on community
   dynamics require the use of a dynamical framework encompassing these
   various components. We here demonstrate how to adapt the framework of
   stochastic community dynamics to the peculiarities of herbaceous
   communities, by using a short temporal resolution adapted to the time
   scale of competition between herbaceous plants, and by taking into
   account the seasonal drops in plant aerial biomass following winter,
   harvesting or consumption by herbivores. We develop a hybrid inference
   method for this novel modelling framework that both uses numerical
   simulations and likelihood computations. Applying this methodology to
   empirical data from the Jena biodiversity experiment, we find that
   environmental stochasticity has a larger effect on community dynamics
   than demographic stochasticity, and that both effects are generally
   smaller than observation errors at the plot scale. We further evidence
   that plant intrinsic growth rates and carrying capacities are moderately
   predictable from plant vegetative height, specific leaf area and leaf
   dry matter content. We do not find any trade-off between demographical
   components, since species with larger intrinsic growth rates tend to
   also have lower demographic and environmental variances. Finally, we
   find that our model is able to make relatively good predictions of
   multi-specific community dynamics based on the assumption of competitive
   symmetry. (c) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of grazing management in mountains has resulted in a
   dramatic decrease of areas occupied by semi-natural grasslands with
   Nardus stricta. In order to effectively protect existing fragments, it
   is important to understand the mechanisms governing the organization of
   communities with Nardus. The aim of this study was to quantify the
   relative impact of the time span of abandonment and also of topographic
   and spatial factors on the species composition of montane and subalpine
   grasslands. Old and recent phytosociological data from three distinct
   regions in the northern part of the Carpathians were compared by
   indirect and direct ordination methods. The majority of the explained
   variation at the supraregional scale was associated with the joint
   effect of spatial trends and elevation above sea level. At the
   intraregional scale, the contribution of land use abandonment was much
   greater, particularly at low elevations with warmer and drier
   environmental conditions. The results suggest that the effects of
   grazing abandonment depend on natural factors such as elevation and
   climate. Conservation programmes for Nardus grasslands should take into
   consideration their position along the elevational gradient. In the
   lower montane zone, management measures should ensure a low nutrient
   level to restrict the spread of nitrophilous plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Across the globe, many species of reptile are threatened with
   extinction, with changes in grazing pressure as a significant factor in
   their decline. Few studies have investigated the role of native
   herbivores, yet studying natural grazers may provide insight into
   natural grazing regimes, not apparent in studies of domestic livestock.
   In this study, we investigate the habitat requirements of a threatened
   Australian grassland reptile, the striped legless lizard, Delma impar,
   in grasslands grazed by a native herbivore, the eastern grey kangaroo
   Macropus giganteus. Delma impar appears sensitive to habitat change
   resulting from altered grazing intensity, but a lack of information
   hinders implementation of appropriate grazing regimes. To address this
   gap, we investigated habitat preferences of D. impar at multiple spatial
   scales across a grazing gradient. We found that the occurrence of D.
   impar was not affected by the size of grassland remnants, but was
   negatively related to the density of native grazers. This result was
   likely a consequence of the negative effect of high grazing intensity on
   grass structural complexity, as the probability of encountering a D.
   impar was positively related to grass structural complexity at the fine
   scale (1m(2)). We recommend that conservation efforts should avoid high
   intensity grazing (equivalent to >1.3 kangaroos/ha), yet ensure enough
   grazing disturbance is maintained to promote the formation of complex
   grass structures. We also recommend that small floristically degraded
   and fragmented grassland habitat should be included in conservation
   efforts. These recommendations will likely benefit a number of faunal
   species in grasslands grazed by domestic and native grazers.
   Importantly, our data highlight the need for managing grazing regimes,
   even in environments dominated by native herbivores.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{53}},

Abstract = {{1. The application of a filter-based assembly model is a promising
   concept to support ecological restoration. The filters illustrate
   dispersal, abiotic and biotic constraints that narrow down the species
   pool and determine the realized species composition. The aim of
   restoration interventions is the manipulation of filters to achieve a
   restoration target.
   2. We tested the applicability of a filter-based assembly model in the
   restoration of endemic Pannonian sandy grassland on old-fields. We
   report the results of a six-year experiment to identify key filters and
   find possible interactions. Treatments included the following: (i)
   seeding (dispersal filter), (ii) carbon amendment to lower nitrogen
   availability (abiotic filter) and (iii) mowing (biotic filter).
   Treatments were carried out in 1 m(2) plots following the same Latin
   square design in three old-fields.
   3. Seeding was the most important treatment increasing species richness,
   vascular cover and enhancing target species composition. Mowing played a
   secondary role, acting primarily in interaction with the other
   treatments. Carbon amendment significantly reduced soil mineral
   nitrogen, but played a subordinate role in determining vegetation
   composition. Significant interactions were found between the biotic and
   dispersal and the biotic and abiotic filters determining primarily the
   structural characteristics of the vegetation in terms of vascular cover,
   moss cover, litter and bare ground. Regarding species composition,
   synergistic links between the dispersal and biotic filters for seeded
   species and long-lived forbs, and antagonistic interaction between the
   dispersal and abiotic filters for seeded species were found.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Based on the impact and interactions of
   filters uncovered in this experiment, we propose a scheme for Pannonian
   grassland restoration, which can be validated and also used for other
   oligotrophic systems. In the proposed conceptual model, the dispersal
   filter plays a key role in determining the outcome of restoration
   measures followed by the biotic filter if manipulated by mowing, while
   the abiotic filter altered by nitrogen immobilization proved to have a
   weak effect. Based on our results, targeting several filters in parallel
   would improve restoration outcome. We propose that filter interactions
   should form an integral part of filter-based assembly models and should
   be taken into account in restoration decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, agriculture is the greatest source of threat to biodiversity,
   through both ongoing conversion of natural habitat and intensification
   of existing farmland. Land sparing and land sharing have been suggested
   as alternative approaches to reconcile this threat with the need for
   land to produce food. To examine which approach holds most promise for
   grassland species, we examined how bird population densities changed
   with farm yield (production per unit area) in the Campos of Brazil and
   Uruguay. We obtained information on biodiversity and crop yields from 24
   sites that differed in agricultural yield. Density-yield functions were
   fitted for 121 bird species to describe the response of population
   densities to increasing farm yield, measured in terms of both food
   energy and profit. We categorized individual species according to how
   their population changed across the yield gradient as being positively
   or negatively affected by farming and according to whether the species'
   total population size was greater under land-sparing, land-sharing, or
   an intermediate strategy. Irrespective of the yield, most species were
   negatively affected by farming. Increasing yields reduced densities of
   approximately 80\% of bird species. We estimated land sparing would
   result in larger populations than other sorts of strategies for 67\% to
   70\% of negatively affected species, given current production levels,
   including three threatened species. This suggests that increasing yields
   in some areas while reducing grazing to low levels elsewhere may be the
   best option for bird conservation in these grasslands. Implementing such
   an approach would require conservation and production policies to be
   explicitly linked to support yield increases in farmed areas and
   concurrently guarantee that larger areas of lightly grazed natural
   grasslands are set aside for conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Wood-pastures are biodiverse biotopes where livestock graze among trees.
   The diversity of several species groups is related to the structural
   diversity created by herbivores and by trees, decaying wood and rocks.
   One of the greatest threats to wood-pastures is abandonment that results
   in decreased heterogeneity of soil microhabitats as well as encroachment
   by young trees. We studied the diversity of bryophytes on different
   microhabitat types (soil, rocks, trees and decaying wood) in grazed and
   abandoned boreal wood-pastures (48 sites). Most species grew on soil,
   rocks or both. For both soil and rocks currently grazed sites had higher
   bryophyte species richness and several individual species also preferred
   grazed sites over abandoned sites. The grazers increase biodiversity by
   creating patches of bare soil and exposed rock surfaces. Currently
   grazed and abandoned sites did not differ significantly in bryophyte
   species richness on decaying wood or trees, and the overall bryophyte
   richness on these substrates was quite low due to the scarcity of dead
   wood and large living deciduous trees with suitable bark conditions.
   Rare species were observed on all microhabitats, most abundantly on soil
   and decaying wood. Especially our result on higher richness on rock
   surfaces shows the complexity of grazing effects on biodiversity.
   Grazers may affect the biodiversity of a species group that is not
   consumed by them, on a surface which is not attractive to them. These
   unobvious interactions should be recalled when planning wood-pasture
   management and conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The abandonment of pastures often leads to a remarkable deterioration of

   regional park) on an abandoned pasture inside a beech forest encroached
   by intrusive species (mainly bracken). We analyzed the effect on sward's
   specific composition and grazing value of two agronomic factors: (i) the
   establishment method (ploughing followed by sowing of a forage mixture
   versus no intervention), and (ii) the number of cuts performed on
   vegetation during the growing season (0, 1 or 2 cuts). Plots were
   arranged according to a split-split-plot experimental design with three
   replications, with the sampling dates as the main factor, the

   the sub-subplot factor. In each plot, data were recorded once a month

   significantly reduced the presence of bracken, even with no cuts, with
   strong effects on the qualitative value of the pasture. A single cut

Title = {{The interplay of nurse and target plant traits influences magnitude and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   Facilitation is a key process in vegetation dynamics, driving the
   response to natural and anthropogenic pressures. In harsh-grazed
   systems, palatable plants mainly survive when nested under unpalatable
   tussocks and shrubs. The magnitude and direction of positive
   interactions are driven by resource availability, extent of herbivory
   and type of nurse species. We hypothesized that different combinations
   of disturbance and environmental stress affect community composition in
   the dry Puna (southern Peruvian Andes) by modifying nurse types and
   plant interactions in magnitude and specific associations. We
   investigated whether different combinations of stress and disturbance
   influence species richness, type and frequency of occurrence of nurse
   and beneficiary species and magnitude and patterns of plant
   interactions; whether nurse species influence these interactions and
   target species change their interactions under different combinations of
   stress and disturbance and whether plant functional traits differ in the
   studied communities and influence the pattern of spatial interactions.
   Methods
   We selected three plant communities subject to different precipitation
   and management regimes: in each we laid a number of transects
   proportional to its extension. Data collected include species
   presence/absence, type of spatial interactions with nurse species and
   functional traits. We calculated species richness and rarefaction
   patterns, described the patterns of plant-plant spatial interactions and
   investigated the associations between nurse and other species in the
   three communities using indicator species analysis (ISA). We performed
   ISA and correlation analysis to investigate whether plant functional
   traits influenced facilitative interactions.
   Important Findings
   We found that different combinations of stress and disturbance shaped a
   complex set of responses, including changes in the nurse species set.
   Nurse composition influenced magnitude and direction of plant
   interactions under different stress intensities. Heavy disturbance
   increased the relative importance of facilitation, even if the overall
   number of facilitated species decreased. Under equivalent disturbance
   regimes, increased abiotic stress led to a greater importance of
   facilitation. Different combinations of stress and disturbance affected
   the community assemblage also by changing the behaviour of some
   non-nurse species. Both heavy disturbance and strong stress led to a
   decrease of trait states; with certain combinations of stress and
   disturbance, preferential distribution of these states was observed. We
   also found that plant traits were of key importance in determining
   facilitative interactions. Some traits were mainly associated with one
   type of spatial interaction: plant architecture, life cycle and root
   type influenced the type of interaction between nurses and beneficiaries
   under different combinations of stress and disturbance. Our results also
   demonstrate that in plant interaction research the object of
   observations (species per se, species percentage, etc.) might influence
   outputs, and to effectively assess the impact of different stress and
   disturbance intensities on plant interactions it is necessary to work at
   the community level to consider the whole species pool.}},

Abstract = {{Interseeding is a common method used to increase species richness within

   success by seeding a mix of 10 common tallgrass prairie species into
   1-m(2) plots within two warm-season grass dominated grasslands. We
   clipped the vegetation on a subset of the plots once or repeatedly and
   measured environmental variables including litter depth, soil surface
   light, soil moisture, and soil nitrate within the first growing season.
   While clipping consistently increased soil surface light, seeded species
   emergence varied in response to measured environmental resources between
   sites. In the lowland site, emergence over two growing seasons was
   primarily explained by microsite and early season light availability. In
   the more recently burned upland site, emergence was primarily limited by
   later season light conditions associated with clipping. Despite this
   variation, seed additions increased plot-scale species richness
   irrespective of clipping effects mainly as a result of high
   establishment of wild bergamot (Monarda fistulosa) in both sites. It
   appears that effects of season-long defoliation management on seedling
   emergence depend on microsite conditions at seeding and we conclude that
   soil surface and established vegetation management are necessary when

Abstract = {{Grazing ecosystems are often characterized by dynamic vegetation
   structure mosaics of short grazing lawns and tall grass vegetation that
   are important for the biodiversity and functioning of these ecosystems.
   Grazing-induced trampling, causing soil compaction and reduced water
   infiltration, has been shown to be an important mechanism for lawn grass
   formation. However, insights in reverse bioturbation mechanisms were
   mostly lacking, especially how tall vegetation persists under continuous
   grazing by herbivores. In this study, we explore if defecation by large
   herbivores in combination with different groups of coprophagous
   macrodetritivores can locally convert compacted grazing lawn patches
   back to tall bunch grasslands with a more loose soil. Across a rainfall
   gradient in an African savannah, we separated the potential roles in
   this process between dung beetles versus earthworms and termites. We
   placed different mesh sizes under dung piles and studied the
   consequences for soil, vegetation, and hydrological properties. We found
   that soil water infiltration rate, soil organic matter content,
   electrical conductivity, bunch grass cover, and bunch grass biomass were
   significantly promoted by dung addition, irrespective of position along
   the rainfall gradient. In addition, the presence of tunneling dung
   beetles significantly increased water infiltration rate and biomass of
   bunch grasses, pointing at a new mechanism whereby macrodetritivores
   affect the structure and diversity of plant communities. We conclude
   that coprophagous macrodetritivores interact with large herbivores in
   contributing to the maintenance of structural heterogeneity in the
   vegetation of grazing ecosystems, with a special role played by
   soil-tunneling dung beetles.}},

Abstract = {{Initial plant diversity might control subsequent community assembly
   processes and plant productivity. To study these effects, we used a
   biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment) with subplots of different
   sown diversity that were never weeded and spontaneously colonized
   control plots of different size (3.5 x 3.5 m, 20 x 20 m) with and
   without mowing in an 8-year study. On non-sown bare plots without
   mowing, colonizer accumulation depended on plot size resulting in a loss
   of diversity in large, undisturbed (unmown) control plots after initial
   colonization. On sown plots that were mown, species richness converged
   to high levels due to the accumulation of internal colonists (species
   belonging to the experimental pool of sown species), while initially
   high species richness of external colonists (species not belonging to
   the experimental pool) and residents (species sown on the plot) declined
   over time. The convergence of total species richness at higher levels
   was paralleled by increased taxonomic (Simpson index, Q(simp)),
   phylogenetic (Q(phylo)) and trait (FDQ) diversity, whereby FDQ was
   greatest on plots with low resident species richness after several
   years. Rates of change in terms of species colonization and extinction
   decelerated over time irrespective of resident species richness, mowing
   or plot size. While the contribution of residents declined and that of
   colonists increased, community biomass production did not change over
   time. The biomasses of residents and colonists were greatest at higher
   levels of species richness, partial Q(phylo) and FDQ of the respective
   species group, but community biomass was consistently weakly related to
   total species richness and diversity indices. Our study shows that in
   contrast to the period of succession, ``mature{''} plant communities
   resulting from natural assembly processes, favouring the coexistence of
   multiple species and thus high biodiversity, do no longer show
   significant relationships between species richness and variables related
   to ecosystem functioning such as primary productivity. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Background: Knowledge about vegetation and soil seed bank composition
   and the processes that contribute to vegetation recovery after the
   removal of heavy grazing is lacking in sub-alpine ecosystems.Aims: In
   order to assess the effects of large herbivores on above-ground
   vegetation (AGV) and soil seed bank (SSB) characteristics, intensively
   sheep-grazed areas were compared to adjacent areas where grazing had
   been removed 10years previously in a sub-alpine grassland of northern
   Iran.Methods: A total of 40 4-m(2) (2mx2m) plots were established in
   each treatment, and soil samples were collected from each plot within a
   depth of 10cm. Plant species composition was determined for each plot
   during the flowering stage of herbaceous species in June 2011. The
   seedling emergence method was used to estimate SSB composition.Results:
   A total of 45 species (23 annuals and 22 perennials) emerged from the
   soil samples of the grazed area, while the number of species emerged
   from the soil samples of the previously grazing area was 76 (37 annuals
   and 39 perennials). The removal of grazing led to a significant increase
   in species richness and seed density in the SSB. Species turnover of AGV
   was higher, and that of the SSB was similar for grazed areas compared
   with areas that were formerly grazed. Detrended correspondence analysis
   ordination of AGV composition showed a clearly separate structure
   between grazed plots and plots where grazing has been removed, while the
   segregation was less clear for SSB composition.Conclusions: We concluded
   that restoration of locally degraded sites cannot rely on the SSB when
   grazing is stopped simultaneously and unvegetated gaps are colonised by
   vegetative growth rather than by seed.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing of grasslands by large herbivores is a form of land use
   intensification that affects not only plant communities but also soil
   biota and the ecosystem services that it provides. While grassland
   ecosystem responses to grazing have been extensively studied, few
   studies have focused on the effects of aboveground herbivores on
   belowground diversity and functions. In this work, we quantified effects
   of grazing on the structure, function and dynamic stability of soil food
   webs. We sampled a long-term grazing manipulation in a semi-arid
   shortgrass steppe (USA Great Plains) at sites showing contrasting soil
   textures. Treatments included native steppe plots that have been
   moderately grazed since 1939 paired with plots totally protected from
   grazing since 1996. We sampled our plots for soil C and N, and for soil
   biota, separated microbes and micro- and mesofauna in trophic functional
   groups and defined trophic relationships. We used models to estimate
   carbon and nitrogen mineralization, energy flow throughout the food web,
   interaction strengths between trophic groups at steady-state and,
   eventually, asymptotic (near-equilibrium or local) stability (Moore and
   de Ruiter, 2012). Soil food web response to grazing depended on soil
   texture and organic matter content. In our food webs, most energy flowed
   through the fungal and bacterial detritus-based channels (sensu Moore
   and Hunt, 1988). There was a clear asymmetry between the amount of
   energy flowing through each of the two channels and, the higher this
   asymmetry, the higher was food web stability. Stability was affected by
   both grazing and soil properties (increased under grazing in high clay
   soils with high organic matter content but decreased in less organic
   loam sandy soils), and positively associated with soil organic matter
   content. Overall, we found that the carbon flow through the soil food
   web of the shortgrass steppe is responsive to grazing in ways that
   altered stability and that structural, functional, and dynamic
   attributes are sensitive parameters for evaluating soil response to land
   use under changing scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Many golf courses are converting out-of-play areas to meadow-like
   habitat to reduce mowing, irrigation, and chemical inputs. Such
   naturalized roughs, which often constitute 50 \% or more of a course's
   total acreage, support biodiversity by providing habitat for pollinators
   and other wildlife. This study explored the hypothesis that they also
   serve as reservoirs of invertebrate natural enemies whose services
   extend to suppress pests in adjacent mowed turf. We used vacuum
   sampling, pitfall traps, and ant baits to compare arthropod populations
   in grassland or meadow-type naturalized roughs and traditional mowed
   roughs at two courses, and tested for spillover of biological control
   using sentinel eggs or larvae of a grass-feeding caterpillar exposed
   near or farther from naturalized areas into mowed turf. Although some
   natural enemies (e.g., spiders) were more abundant in naturalized
   roughs, we saw no direct spillover of predation which was quite high
   regardless of habitat type. Most likely that is because ground-nesting
   ants (Lasius, Solenopsis, and Pheidole spp.), which are dominant
   predators in this system, were equally or more abundant in the mowed
   turfgrass. Herbivorous insects, too, were more abundant in naturalized
   roughs, so prey availability may discourage solitary ground-dwelling
   predators from leaving those refuges to forage in mowed areas. There was
   no parasitism of sentinel eggs or larvae in our trials. Despite absence
   of direct spillover of predation, we argue that naturalized roughs might
   be more purposely designed and managed to promote parasitoids,
   insectivorous birds, and other enemies that provide diffuse biological
   control services elsewhere on the course.}},

Abstract = {{Many migratory grassland passerines complete their annual life cycle
   within the United States and investigations into wintering ecology of
   these species are scarce, particularly in ecoregions where habitat
   quality is considered to be compromised, such as the coastal prairie of
   Texas. During 2008-2010, we investigated wintering grassland bird
   ecology as related to coastal prairie composition and management
   practices on the mid-upper Texas coast. To quantify grassland bird
   composition and density among management regimes, we performed 260
   transect surveys on 40 different study site pastures deployed among 7
   different management regimes, varying in plant community composition as
   well as frequency (or occurrence) of burning, grazing, and mowing from
   29 October 2008-7 April 2009 and 17 November 2009-17 March 2010. A total
   of 79 bird species (48 species in 2008-2009 and 66 species in 2009-2010)
   were recorded during this study. Sites that were recently (<2 years
   prior) grazed, burned, or mowed tended to have the greatest species
   richness of obligate grassland bird species. Management regime and the
   resulting habitat characteristics also appeared to influence densities
   of Le Conte's Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii), Sedge Wren (Cistothorus
   platensis), and Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii), with the former two
   species selecting areas that had not been recently burned, grazed, or
   mowed and were characterized by greater vertical vegetation density and
   litter depth, respectively. Conversely, Sprague's Pipit selected
   recently burned, grazed, or mowed prairies, characterized by less litter
   depth and percentage of shrubs nearby. More cosmopolitan species, such
   as Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna) and Savannah Sparrow
   (Passerculus sandwichensis) occurred equally among management regimes.
   Despite similar species richness in floristically disturbed sites,
   nonnative vegetation appeared to negatively influence species with
   specific habitat requirements such as Sprague's Pipit, Sedge Wren, and
   Le Conte's Sparrow. In order to increase wintering avian diversity,
   coastal prairie habitat conservation and management in Texas should
   focus on restoring management regimes (i.e., burning, mowing, and
   grazing) that create heterogeneous environments, while maintaining
   native vegetation communities.}},

Abstract = {{Plant diversity and soil organisms are both widely studied for their
   contributions to ecosystem functions. It has been recently shown that
   soil biota may drive the plant species diversity-function relationship
   in grasslands, while so far studies on plant intraspecific diversity are
   lacking. To improve the understanding of how ecosystem functions may be
   influenced by plant intraspecific diversity, soil organisms, and their
   interactions, we used a field setting to examine the effects of plant
   intraspecific diversity and functionally dissimilar soil organisms
   (manipulated by the addition of northern root-knot nematodes,
   earthworms, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) on aboveground primary
   production, pollination and shoot herbivory. Plant intraspecific
   diversity was manipulated by sowing different seed mixtures of Trifolium
   pratense L. and Lolium perenne L. cultivars. We found a positive effect
   of plant intraspecific diversity on total aboveground primary
   production, contributed mostly by T. pratense. The plant intraspecific
   diversity-productivity effect on T. pratense was mediated by the
   nematodes, i.e. aboveground biomass was increased by intraspecific
   diversity only in the nematode treatment. Further, the average floral
   visitation length was decreased by earthworm addition, while the
   abundance of pollinators tended to be increased by high plant
   intraspecific diversity. Leaf damage of T. pratense were not influenced
   by the treatments. We conclude that plant intraspecific diversity and
   soil organisms can interactively or independently modify functions such
   as aboveground primary production and pollination of T. pratense in the
   field. Specifically, the positive plant intraspecific diversity effect
   appears to only emerge under conditions of stress (high nematode
   abundance). This result indicates that plant intraspecific diversity may
   be important for the maintenance of ecosystem functions, especially in
   an agricultural context, where pest pressure can be high and can have
   large detrimental consequences. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Invasion of the tall grass Brachypodium genuense was observed in an area
   of the central Apennines (Italy) where the population size of Apennine
   chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica ornata) was in strong decline. Since this
   dominant tall grass threatens biodiversity and forage quality, our
   hypothesis was that B. genuense abundance influenced that of palatable
   species for the chamois, depending on their functional traits and
   distribution patterns. Our sampling design used plots of 10 x 10 m and 1
   x 1 m to investigate the plant community level and fine-scale
   interactions. We analyzed data using correlation, generalized linear
   models, and redundancy analyses. We found that B. genuense can reach
   high abundance values on the deepest soils. Its high cover value
   influences plant community composition by competitive exclusion of
   subordinate species and suppression of functional features because of
   temporal or spatial niche overlap. This leads to low cover of palatable
   species at a fine scale, and to poor pasture quality for chamois at a
   wider scale. Therefore, we postulated that B. genuense invasion,
   enhanced by long-term grazing cessation, may reduce the availability of
   palatable plants for Apennine chamois, especially below the potential
   timberline (1900-2000 m a.s.l.). The high abundance of B. genuense may
   amplify the effect of other negative factors, such as competition with
   red deer (Cervus elaphus) and climate change, in restricting the
   suitable habitat of the Apennine chamois to the higher sectors of the
   central Apennines. Thus, we suggested that B. genuense spread should be
   monitored carefully and plans to control its invasion should be
   implemented.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing agricultural activities have been shown to affect soil and
   vegetation changes leading to serious biodiversity declines throughout
   the world. These effects are amplified in dry grassland areas, where
   resulting changes in habitat structure affect threatened animals on long
   temporal scales. Great bustards (Otis tarda) inhabit open landscapes
   where fire and grazing have been a part of the natural disturbance
   regime since historical times. Even fire and grazing are hypothesized to
   be important factors in the lifecycle of the species, studies are still
   missing on disturbance-related lekking distribution patterns of great
   bustards. We analyzed the importance of fires and grazing on the spatial
   distribution of lekking bustards controlling for habitat types, habitat
   diversity, distance from roads and social effects. Our standardized
   dataset spanned 31 years, being one of the largest datasets on bustard
   lekking. During the 31 years we observed 10 118 individuals at 639
   observation points in Hortobagy National Park, East-Hungary. One of the
   most important predictors for total number of birds and number of males
   was the area burnt in previous years. We found that increased habitat
   diversity had a positive effect on female numbers. Models fit on
   second-and third-year burn data detected no substantial role of burning
   on lekking distribution. Our results suggest that introduction of a
   patch-burning management system in lekking areas could increase the
   availability of optimal lek sites for bustards. As an effective
   management tool, we suggest applying patch-burning annually in a
   spatially mosaic structure inside the area occupied by each

Abstract = {{Overgrazing by livestock is a serious threat to the biodiversity in the
   tropical forests of Asia. Feral horse, an introduced species at Point
   Calimere Wildlife Sanctuary, is a grazer and overlaps extensively in
   space and food resources with blackbuck, a native species, and thus
   could be a potential competitor. We have assessed, between December 2012
   and June 2013, if the ecological conditions in the study site favour
   competition between these two species by assessing their spatial
   distribution pattern, population density, and dietary overlap. Spatial
   distribution pattern on direct sighting of both the species across
   habitats revealed that feral horses ranged mostly in the southern and
   southeastern parts of the sanctuary, in areas mostly with open
   grasslands, overlapping extensively in space with blackbuck, a grassland
   habitat specialist of the sanctuary. Population density estimated using
   line-transect distance sampling method showed 50 (95\% CI 41.6-60.6)
   blacicbucks and 21 (15.2-30.0) feral horses per km(2) of the sanctuary.
   Dietary overlap assessed through site examination of feeding trails
   revealed that out of 14 plant species identified from blackbuck diet
   during the study period, 12 (86\%) were also consumed by feral horses.
   Similarly, food plants such as Cloris parpata, a grass species, and herb
   Desmodiam dryflorae, the principal food of blackbuck, were also the
   major food plants of feral horses. Further, estimation of food
   consumption rate showed that feral horse consumed significantly more
   food per unit time (2.8 +/- 0.08 g/min) than black buck (1.7 +/- 0.07
   g/min). Dietary overlap estimated using Schoener's Index showed a
   significant overlap between the two species (overall 89\% and
   habitat-wise 85-90\%). An analysis of food preference using Jacob's
   Preference Index revealed that all the preferred food plants of the
   blackbuck were equally preferred by feral horses indicating significant
   overlap in the diet species composition. Although the density estimate
   revealed a lesser number of feral horses per capita than blackbuck, the
   higher food consumption rate of the former coupled with larger body
   mass, could outweigh the higher density of blackbuck and the same is
   discussed as an effective ecological competitor. Based on the findings
   appropriate recommendations are made for the management of blackbuck in
   the sanctuary. (C) 2016 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde.

Abstract = {{Plant functional traits are thought to drive variation in primary
   productivity. However, there is a lack of work examining how dominant
   species identity affects trait-productivity relationships. The
   productivity of 12 pasture mixtures was determined in a 3-year field
   experiment. The mixtures were based on either the winter-active ryegrass
   (Lolium perenne) or winter-dormant tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).
   Different mixtures were obtained by adding forb, legume, and grass
   species that differ in key leaf economics spectrum (LES) traits to the
   basic two-species dominant grass-white clover (Trifolium repens)
   mixtures. We tested for correlations between community-weighted mean
   (CWM) trait values, functional diversity, and productivity across all
   plots and within those based on either ryegrass or tall fescue. The
   winter-dormant forb species (chicory and plantain) had leaf traits
   consistent with high relative growth rates both per unit leaf area (high
   leaf thickness) and per unit leaf dry weight (low leaf dry matter
   content). Together, the two forb species achieved reasonable abundance
   when grown with either base grass (means of 36\% and 53\% of total
   biomass, respectively, with ryegrass tall fescue), but they competed
   much more strongly with tall fescue than with ryegrass. Consequently,
   they had a net negative impact on productivity when grown with tall
   fescue, and a net positive effect when grown with ryegrass. Strongly
   significant relationships between productivity and CWM values for LES
   traits were observed across ryegrass-based mixtures, but not across tall
   fescue-based mixtures. Functional diversity did not have a significant
   positive effect on productivity for any of the traits. The results show
   dominant species identity can strongly modify trait-productivity
   relationships in intensively grazed pastures. This was due to
   differences in the intensity of competition between dominant species and
   additional species, suggesting that resource-use complementarity is a
   necessary prerequisite for trait-productivity relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Nonnative plants alter the composition of native plant communities, with
   concomitant effects on arthropods. However, plant invasions may not be
   the only disturbance affecting native communities, and multiple
   disturbances can have compounding effects. We assessed the effects of

   grasslands dominated by nonnative Old World bluestem grasses (OWBs,
   Dichanthium annulatum) to grasslands dominated by native plants during a
   period of decreasing drought severity (2011-2013). Native plant
   communities had more species of plants and arthropods (/m(2)) than areas
   dominated by OWBs during extreme drought, but richness was comparable as
   drought severity decreased. Abundance of arthropods was greater in
   native plant communities than in OWB communities during extreme drought,
   but OWB communities had more arthropods during moderate and non-drought
   conditions. We observed a shift in the arthropod community from one
   dominated by detritivores to one dominated by herbivores following plant
   invasion; the magnitude of this shift increased as drought severity
   decreased. Both plant communities were dominated by nonnative
   arthropods. A nonnative leafhopper (Balclutha rubrostriata) and native
   mites (Mochlozetidae) dominated OWB communities as drought severity
   decreased, and OWBs may serve as refugia for both taxa. Nonnative
   woodlice (Armadillidium vulgare) dominated native plant communities
   during extreme and non-drought conditions and abundance of this species
   may be associated with an increase in plant litter and available
   nutrients. Given the importance of arthropods for ecosystem services,
   incorporating arthropod data into conservation studies may demonstrate
   how changes in arthropod diversity alter ecosystem function where

   performances of Astragalus rigidulus and Potentilla fruticosa change
   along gradients of biotic interactions (represented by plant species
   richness, abundance of the dominant plant species Kobresia pygmaea, and
   herbivory intensity) and abiotic conditions (represented by elevation,

   not contribute significantly to variation among A. rigidulus

Abstract = {{Extensive degraded short tussock grasslands of New Zealand's eastern
   South Island were dominated by woody vegetation prior to burning and
   livestock grazing associated with human settlement starting 800 years
   ago. There is increasing interest in restoring some of these grasslands
   back to a woody state. However, because of the long time frames involved
   in establishing a woody cover, it is difficult to predict the impacts
   that woody restoration will have on the extant herbaceous flora. Using a
   factorial trial with artificial shade and grazing exclusion, we assessed
   the potential impact of woody restoration on the structure and
   composition of the herbaceous flora over a six-year period. The
   imposition of artificial shade resulted in significant increases in
   total species richness and the total cover of herbaceous vegetation,
   increases in cover of several individual forb and grass species and
   decreases in the cover of bare ground, moss and lichen in shade
   treatments. There were also changes in the overall community composition
   of shaded treatments reflecting these changes in vegetation cover and
   species richness. We found no statistically significant effects of
   grazing exclusion. We suggest that increased soil moisture resulting
   from shade addition plays an important role in increasing the herbaceous
   component of the flora. While woody restoration will have a range of
   effects on the herbaceous understorey, for example through competition
   and changes in soil conditions, our findings are important for planning
   future woody restoration in these degraded tussock grasslands. In
   particular, our results suggest that the best approach to ensure the
   persistence of herbaceous vegetation in woody restorations might be to
   ensure that restoration plantings result in a spatially heterogeneous
   vegetation arrangement.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by domestic ungulates can have substantial impacts on forests in
   arid and semi-arid regions, possibly including severe loss of carbon
   from the soil. Predicting net livestock impacts on soil organic carbon
   stocks remains challenging, however, due to the dependence on animal
   loads and on soil and environmental parameters. The objective of this
   study was to better understand grazing effects on soil organic carbon in
   seasonal tropical dry forests of north-eastern Brazil (Caatinga) by
   quantifying carbon stocks of the upper soil profile (0-5 cm depth) and
   greater soil depths (>5 cm depth down to bedrock) along a gradient of
   grazing intensity while accounting for other influencing factors such as
   soil texture, vegetation, landscape topography, and water availability.
   We analysed soil organic carbon, soil clay content, altitude above sea
   level, soil depth to bedrock, distance to the nearest permanent water
   body, species diversity of perennial plants and aboveground biomass on
   45 study plots located in the vicinity of the Itaparica Reservoir,
   Pernambuco, Brazil. Livestock (mainly goats and cattle) are unevenly
   distributed in the studied ecosystem, thus grazing intensity was
   accounted for based on the weight of livestock droppings per square
   metre and classified as no or light, intermediate, or heavy grazing. The
   mean soil organic carbon in the area was 16.86 +/- 1.28 Mg ha(-1) C with
   approximately one-quarter found in the upper 5 cm of the soil profile
   (4.14 +/- 0.43 Mg ha(-1) C) and the remainder (12.57 +/- 0.97 Mg ha(-1)
   C) in greater soil depths (>5 cm). Heavy grazing led to significantly
   lower soil organic carbon stocks in the upper 5 cm, whereas no effect on
   soil organic carbon of the soil overall or in greater soil depths was
   detectable. The soil's clay content and the altitude proved to be the
   most relevant factors influencing overall soil organic carbon stocks and
   those in greater soil depths (>5 cm). Our findings suggest that grazing
   causes substantial release of carbon from Brazilian dry forest soils,
   which should be addressed through improved grazing management via a
   legally compulsory rotation system. This would ultimately contribute to
   the conservation of a unique forest system and associated ecosystem
   services. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The community dynamics of ground beetles as a dominant group in arid

   alterations in vegetation and soil conditions. However, little is known
   about the relative effects of altered vegetation and soil, or their
   interactions, on the composition and diversity of beetle functional
   groups. To address this question, we collected data on the species
   richness and activity abundance of ground carabid and tenebrionid beetle
   functional groups (predators, herbivores, and detritivores), along a
   gradient of land-use conversion from natural grassland to pure and mixed
   plantations of two shrub species (Haloxylon ammodendron and Tamarix
   ramosissima) in an arid region of northwestern China. Additionally, we
   collected key variables related to the vegetation (shrub cover, height,
   herbaceous plant biomass, and species richness) and soil (soil pH,
   texture, and salinity). Variation partitioning showed that vegetation
   changes had stronger effects on the functional group composition than
   changes in the soil did. However, vegetation soil interactions explained
   more of the composition variation in the beetle functional groups than
   vegetation or soil alone. Shrub cover and herbaceous species richness
   were the best predictors of species composition of detritivores and
   herbivores. For predator species composition, shrub height and cover
   were the best predictors. Structural equation models showed that changes
   in vegetation and soil influenced beetle abundance and diversity through
   both direct and indirect effects, and the strength of this influence
   varied among the functional groups. Overall, we conclude that vegetation

Abstract = {{Plant elemental composition can indicate resource limitation, and
   changes in key elemental ratios (e.g. plant C:N ratios) can influence
   rates including herbivory, nutrient recycling, and pathogen infection.
   Although plant stoichiometry can influence ecosystem-level processes,
   very few studies have addressed whether and how plant C:N stoichiometry
   changes with plant diversity and composition. Here, using two long-term
   experimental manipulations of plant diversity (Jena and Cedar Creek), we
   test whether plant richness (species and functional groups) or
   composition (functional group proportions) affects temporal trends and
   variability of community-wide C:N stoichiometry. Site fertility
   determined the initial community-scale C:N ratio. Communities growing on
   N-poor soil (Cedar Creek) began with higher C:N ratios than communities
   growing on N-rich soil (Jena). However, site-level plant C:N ratios
   converged through time, most rapidly in high diversity plots. In Jena,
   plant community C:N ratios increased. This temporal trend was stronger
   with increasing richness. However, temporal variability of C:N decreased
   as plant richness increased. In contrast, C:N decreased over time at
   Cedar Creek, most strongly at high species and functional richness,
   whereas the temporal variability of C:N increased with both measures of
   diversity at this site. Thus, temporal trends in the mean and
   variability of C:N were underlain by concordant changes among sites in
   functional group proportions. In particular, the convergence of
   community-scale C:N over time at these very different sites was mainly
   due to increasing proportions of forbs at both sites, replacing high
   mean C:N (C4 grasses, Cedar Creek) or low C:N (legumes, Jena) species.
   Diversity amplified this convergence; although temporal trends differed
   in sign between the sites, these trends increased in magnitude with
   increasing species richness. Our results suggest a predictive
   mechanistic link between trends in plant diversity and functional group
   composition and trends in the many ecosystem rates that depend on
   aboveground community C:N.
   Synthesis We compared the effect of plant diversity on the temporal
   dynamics of community stoichiometry in two long-term grassland diversity
   experiments: the Cedar Creek and Jena Experiments. Changes in community
   C:N ratios were accelerated by increasing diversity at both sites, but
   in opposite directions depending on soil fertility. Stoichiometry
   changes were driven by shifts of functional group composition differing
   in their elemental compositions, the identity of the functional groups
   depending on the site. Thus, we highlighted that community turnover
   constrained the effect of diversity on plant stoichiometry at both sites}},

Abstract = {{Biotic interactions are often ignored in assessments of climate change
   impacts. However, climate-related changes in species interactions, often
   mediated through increased dominance of certain species or functional
   groups, may have important implications for how species respond to
   climate warming and altered precipitation patterns. We examined how a
   dominant plant functional group affected the population dynamics of four
   co-occurring forb species by experimentally removing graminoids in
   seminatural grasslands. Specifically, we explored how the interaction
   between dominants and subordinates varied with climate by replicating
   the removal experiment across a climate grid consisting of 12 field
   sites spanning broad-scale temperature and precipitation gradients in
   southern Norway. Biotic interactions affected population growth rates of
   all study species, and the net outcome of interactions between dominants
   and subordinates switched from facilitation to competition with
   increasing temperature along the temperature gradient. The impacts of
   competitive interactions on subordinates in the warmer sites could
   primarily be attributed to reduced plant survival. Whereas the response
   to dominant removal varied with temperature, there was no overall effect
   of precipitation on the balance between competition and facilitation.
   Our findings suggest that global warming may increase the relative
   importance of competitive interactions in seminatural grasslands across
   a wide range of precipitation levels, thereby favouring highly
   competitive dominant species over subordinate species. As a result,
   seminatural grasslands may become increasingly dependent on disturbance
   (i.e. traditional management such as grazing and mowing) to maintain
   viable populations of subordinate species and thereby biodiversity under
   future climates. Our study highlights the importance of population-level
   studies replicated under different climatic conditions for understanding
   the underlying mechanisms of climate change impacts on plants.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification is a leading cause of landscape
   homogenization, with negative consequences for biodiversity and
   ecosystem services. Conserving or promoting heterogeneity requires a
   detailed understanding of how farm management affects, and is affected
   by, landscape characteristics.
   We assessed relationships between farming systems and landscape
   characteristics, hypothesising that less-intensive systems act as
   landscape takers, by adapting management to landscape constraints,
   whereas more intensive systems act as landscape makers, by changing the
   landscape to suit farming needs.
   We mapped dominant farming systems in a region of southern Portugal:
   traditional cereal-grazed fallow rotations; specialization on annual
   crops; and specialization on either cattle or sheep. We estimated
   landscape metrics in 241 1-km(2) buffers representing the farming
   systems, and analysed variation among and within systems using
   multivariate statistics and beta diversity metrics.
   Landscape composition varied among systems, with dominance by either
   annual crops (Crop system) or pastures (Sheep), or a mixture between the
   two (Traditional and Cattle). There was a marked regional gradient of
   local landscape heterogeneity, but this contributed little to variation
   among systems. Landscape beta diversity declined from the Sheep to the
   Crop system, and it was inversely related to agriculture intensity.
   Less intensive farming systems appeared compatible with a range of
   landscape characteristics (landscape takers), and may thus be
   particularly suited to agri-environmental management. More intensive
   systems appeared less flexible in terms of landscape characteristics
   (landscape makers), likely promoting regional homogenization. Farming
   systems may provide a useful standpoint to address the design of
   agri-environment schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The pasture-woodlands of Central Europe are low-intensity grazing
   systems in which the structural richness of dynamic forest-grassland
   mosaics is causal for their high biodiversity. Distinct mosaic patterns
   in Picea abies- and Fagus sylvatica-dominated pasture-woodlands in the
   Swiss Jura Mountains suggest a strong influence of tree species
   regeneration ecology on landscape structural properties. At the
   landscape scale, however, cause-effect relationships are complicated by
   habitat selectivity of livestock.
   We asked which tree species regeneration traits and what kind of
   feedbacks among local-scale vegetation dynamics and landscape-scale
   herbivore behavior are causal for the contrasted landscape structural
   characteristics of Picea- and Fagus-dominated pasture-woodlands.
   We performed simulation experiments of mosaic pattern formation in both
   pasture-woodland types. The regeneration traits, namely dispersal
   distance, resistance to browsing and tolerance to shade, and the rules
   for habitat selection of cattle were modified and the corresponding
   shifts in landscape structure were analyzed.
   Dispersal distance showed a significant, but only local, effect
   promoting forest fringe formation. Saplings' resistance to browsing
   mainly determined overall tree cover, but did not influence landscape
   structure. At the landscape scale, both shade tolerance of saplings and
   selective habitat use by cattle were responsible for forest-grassland
   segregation: high shade tolerance triggered segregation, whereas
   non-selective habitat use hindered it.
   Existing local-scale theory on pasture-woodland dynamics is complemented
   by an herbivore-vegetation feedback among spatial scales. In
   low-intensity pastures, where large herbivores are preferentially
   ``grazers{''} and trees form dense canopies, an intrinsic trend towards
   forest-grassland segregation at the expense of forest-grassland ecotones
   is predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change and land use management practices are major drivers of
   biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. To understand and predict
   resulting changes in community structures, individual-based and
   spatially explicit population models are a useful tool but require
   detailed data sets for each species. More generic approaches are thus
   needed. Here we present a trait-based functional type approach to model
   savanna birds. The aim of our model is to explore the response of
   different bird functional types to modifications in habitat structure.
   The functional types are characterized by different traits, in
   particular body mass, which is related to life-history traits
   (reproduction and mortality) and spatial scales (home range area and
   dispersal ability), as well as the use of vegetation structures for
   foraging and nesting, which is related to habitat quality and
   suitability. We tested the performance of the functional types in
   artificial landscapes varying in shrub:grass ratio and clumping
   intensity of shrub patches. We found that an increase in shrub
   encroachment and a decrease in habitat quality caused by land use
   mismanagement and climate change endangered all simulated bird
   functional types. The strength of this effect was related to the
   preferred habitat. Furthermore, larger-bodied insectivores and omnivores
   were more prone to extinction due to shrub encroachment compared to
   small-bodied species. Insectivorous and omnivorous birds were more
   sensitive to clumping intensity of shrubs whereas herbivorous and
   carnivorous birds were most affected by a decreasing amount of grass
   cover. From an applied point of view, our findings emphasize that
   policies such as woody plant removal and a reduction in livestock
   stocking rates to prevent shrub encroachment should prioritize the
   enlargement of existing grassland patches. Overall, our results show
   that the combination of an individual-based modelling approach with
   carefully defined functional types can provide a powerful tool for
   exploring biodiversity responses to environmental changes. Furthermore,
   the increasing accumulation of worldwide data sets on species' core and
   soft traits (surrogates to determine core traits indirectly) on one side
   and the refinement of conceptual frameworks for animal functional types
   on the other side will further improve functional type approaches which
   consider the sensitivities of multiple species to climate change,
   habitat loss, and fragmentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Sown wildflower strips should promote the species diversity of several
   insect groups in order to be an effective tool for the compensation of
   biodiversity loss in agricultural environments. We studied the responses
   of two herbivorous insect groups, Heteroptera (true bugs) and
   Auchenorrhyncha (leaf-hoppers), to the properties of wildflower strips
   in a three-year (2008-2010) study in southern Finland. The experiment
   was replicated in six reed canary grass fields. The insect groups showed
   opposite responses; the abundance of Auchenorrhyncha was lower while the
   abundance and species richness of Heteroptera was higher in wildflower
   than control strips. During succession, both species richness and
   abundance of Auchenorrhyncha increased unlike Heteroptera. This
   difference could largely be explained by dietary differences.
   Auchenorrhyncha, including several grass feeders, could not take
   advantage of the increasing dicot species richness like Heteroptera
   species. This was also a likely reason for the unexpected finding that
   only Heteroptera species richness depended on the placement of the
   strip, being higher near field margins than in mid-field. We conclude
   that the optimal planning and implementation of wildflower strips call
   for the definition of clear goals, the knowledge of the requirements of
   target species as well as considering the cropping system involved. (C)

Abstract = {{Wood-pastures have been formed by traditional low-intensity livestock
   grazing in wooded areas. They host high biodiversity values that are now
   threatened by both management abandonment (ceased grazing) and
   agricultural intensification, and therefore these habitats are of
   conservation interest in Europe. In order to explore the effects of
   grazing on the biodiversity of boreal wood-pastures, we studied the
   communities of vascular plants and bryophytes in 24 currently grazed and
   24 abandoned sites. In addition to the current management situation, we
   studied the effects of soil pH and moisture, tree density, historical
   land-use intensity, time since abandonment (in abandoned sites) and
   grazing intensity (in grazed sites). Grazed sites had higher species
   richness of both species groups and rare species were also slightly more
   numerous. Grazing impacted the community composition of vascular plants
   more than that of bryophytes. For both species groups soil pH (which
   ranged from 3 to 5) was the most important variable in determining
   species richness, the number of rare species and the composition of
   communities. The responses of the two species groups varied somewhat,
   but generally species richness was maximized on sites with higher soil
   pH, moisture and grazing intensity, but lower tree cover. We conclude
   that more effort should be paid on maintaining currently grazed sites
   under management. If a site has been abandoned, it could be restored
   into a wood-pasture if it still retains some structural features such as
   openness and typical species of a wood-pasture. Highest biological
   conservation values for both management and protection can be found
   among those sites that are naturally most fertile, but attention should
   also be paid on the landscape-scale versatility of managed sites. (C)

Abstract = {{To maintain the high biodiversity of semi-natural grasslands, management
   by grazing or mowing is needed. Given the limited resources and few
   remaining areas, the best management method should be used. However,
   only a few studies comparing the effects of mowing and grazing on

   was to extract as much data as possible from the literature and evaluate
   them using a meta-analysis approach. We searched scientific and grey
   literature for studies comparing the effects of grazing and annual
   mowing on outcomes relevant for biodiversity conservation. We identified
   35 relevant studies on grazing and annual mowing that provided data
   suitable for the meta-analysis. We found that grazing generally had a
   more positive effect on the conservation value of semi-natural
   grasslands compared to mowing, but effect sizes were generally small to
   moderate for most contrasts. Furthermore, effects varied across some
   grassland characteristics e.g. for different grassland types, with
   grazing and mowing having a similar effect or mowing having a more
   positive effect in certain cases. Our results suggest, that in most
   cases grazing should be the preferred management method when managing

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{Insect herbivores can shift the composition of a plant community, but
   the mechanism underlying such shifts remains largely unexplored. A
   possibility is that insects alter the competitive symmetry between plant
   species. The effect of herbivory on competition likely depends on
   whether the plants are subjected to aboveground or belowground herbivory
   or both, and also depends on soil nitrogen levels. It is unclear how
   these biotic and abiotic factors interactively affect competition. Ina
   greenhouse experiment, we measured competition between two coexisting
   grass species that respond differently to nitrogen deposition: Dactylis
   glomerata L., which is competitively favoured by nitrogen addition, and
   Festuca rubra L., which is competitively favoured on nitrogen-poor
   soils. We predicted: (1) that aboveground herbivory would reduce
   competitive asymmetry at high soil nitrogen by reducing the competitive
   advantage of D. glomerata; and (2), that belowground herbivory would
   relax competition at low soil nitrogen, by reducing the competitive
   advantage of F. rubra. Aboveground herbivory caused a 46 A) decrease in
   the competitive ability of F. rubra, and a 23\% increase in that of D.
   glomerata, thus increasing competitive asymmetry, independently of soil
   nitrogen level. Belowground herbivory did not affect competitive
   symmetry, but the combined influence of above and belowground herbivory
   was weaker than predicted from their individual effects. Belowground
   herbivory thus mitigated the increased competitive asymmetry caused by
   aboveground herbivory. D. glomerata remained competitively dominant
   after the cessation of aboveground herbivory, showing that the influence
   of herbivory continued beyond the feeding period. We showed that insect
   herbivory can strongly influence plant competitive interactions. In our
   experimental plant community, aboveground insect herbivory increased the
   risk of competitive exclusion of F. rubra. Belowground herbivory
   appeared to mitigate the influence of aboveground herbivory, and this
   mechanism may play a role for plant species coexistence.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Which are the main sub-alpine and alpine grassland
   communities in the northeastern Greater Caucasus of Azerbaijan and what
   are their environmental and anthropogenic drivers?
   Location: Grasslands at 1800 and 3500 m a.s.l. on northern macroslope of
   the Greater Caucasus in Azerbaijan near Shahdag Mt.
   Methods: We established a randomized sampling design with stratification
   by geomorphology and altitude and validation using remote sensing data.
   The vegetation survey on 194 releves in a nested plot design of up to
   100 m(2) encompassed examiniation of various site conditions. We applied
   cluster and indicator species analysis for vegetation classification,
   and indirect multivariate ordination to assess vegetation-environment
   relationships.
   Results: We classified 13 unranked communities in two sub-alpine groups
   and one alpine group, plus the very distinct vegetation around camp
   sites of semi-nomadic herders. Important drivers for vegetation
   differentiation are altitude as proxy for temperature, latitude as proxy
   for orographically founded differences in bedrock and precipitation,
   aspect, soil factors, such as content of organic matter and variables
   connected to land-use types and intensity (e.g. pasturing vs hay
   meadows, browsing tracks). In consequence, also effects on species
   richness are detectable. Furthermore, we found only partial concordance
   of our communities with existing vegetation classifications in the
   Greater Caucasus.
   Conclusions: A state-of-the-art classification and ordination of
   regional high-mountain grassland communities and their environmental
   drivers fills a gap in knowledge about this vegetation. It is widely
   unknown to international audience and remained almost unstudied during
   the last 25 yr, when severe shifts in land use remarkably changed the
   natural conditions. The study can help to identify problems in current
   grassland management and their consequences for biodiversity
   conservation. Desirable changes towards sustainable grassland
   utilization require combined socio-ecological assessments beforehand.}},

   detailed study of vegetation, soil physicochemical properties and soil
   communities (primarily microbial) to reforestation of a pasture (15
   years post reforestation), and its immediately adjacent un-restored
   pasture, are presented. Whereas the reforested portion of the site had
   significantly higher levels of tree canopy cover and a well-developed
   litter layer than the immediately adjacent pasture, the reverse was true
   for grass biomass. Although there were no differences in total root
   biomass between the sampling zones, the pasture zone was dominated by
   fine roots and the reforested zone by coarse roots. Reforestation had a
   significant impact on soil physicochemical properties, with soil C, C: N
   and mineral N being higher than in the pasture. The reforestation also
   supported a greater microbial PLFA, a higher Fungal: Bacterial PLFA
   ratio and a different microbial community (based on PLFA profiles) from
   that of the adjacent pasture. There were also differences in earthworm
   abundance, with earthworms present and absent in soils from the pasture
   and reforested zones, respectively. All of the changes in vegetation,
   soil physicochemical properties and biotic communities occurred abruptly

Abstract = {{The effect of transforming natural habitat to commercial land uses can

   subtropical EN in a timber production landscape in South Africa respond
   to disturbance history (i.e. natural vs. recovering after removal of
   Pinus spp.), mowing in firebreaks (i.e. 30 m wide grassy strips intended
   to stop spread of fires in plantations), and three design parameters:
   corridor width, distance to protected area boundary, and context i.e.
   proportion eucalypt compartments within 500 m radius. Reference sites

   Past disturbances and the current practice of mowing in firebreaks
   significantly influenced plant species composition, but not plant

   similar between natural and recovering grassland. None of the design
   variables affected plant species richness, or composition. However,
   dominance was significantly and negatively correlated with corridor
   width, and positively correlated with context. Hence, sites are ordered
   in terms of their biodiversity value from greatest to lowest: natural
   areas > recovering areas > firebreaks. Based on these results, natural
   grassland in wide, well-connected corridors should have greatest
   conservation priority. We recommend that past disturbances, and current

   the design of future ENs. Such an approach is necessary for effective

Abstract = {{Recent global land-use changes have led to reductions in many herbaceous

   timing of management practices on the genetic diversity as well as the
   reproductive success of rare semi-natural grassland species. We
   determined the suitable management (mowing) timing for Vincetoxicum
   pycnostelma Kitag. (Apocynaceae; Asclepiadoideae), an endangered summer-
   and autumn-blooming semi-natural grassland herb. We examined 15 V.
   pycnostelma populations to assess the effects of mowing timing on the
   genetic diversity of each population using nine microsatellite markers
   and on pollination and reproductive success. Pollination success was not
   affected by flowering timing. Mowing during the mid- to late flowering
   and fruiting periods of V. pycnostelma (July-September) had a
   significant negative effect on the number of inflorescences and total
   fruits produced, whereas mowing before flowering and growing periods
   (April, May and November-March) had positive effects on the number of
   inflorescences and fruits, respectively. Furthermore, mowing during the
   mid- to late flowering and fruiting periods also caused a significant
   decrease in genetic diversity. Our results demonstrated that mowing
   events during the mid- to late flowering and fruiting periods caused
   significant declines in the genetic diversity and/or reproductive
   success of V pycnostelma. By contrast, mowing before flowering periods
   significantly enhanced reproductive success. To conserve semi-natural
   grassland herb diversity, mowing should be avoided during seasons when
   the flowering and fruiting periods of many endangered species overlap.

Abstract = {{Top-down effects of herbivores and bottom-up effects of nutrients shape
   productivity and diversity across ecosystems, yet their single and
   combined effects on spatial and temporal beta diversity is unknown. We
   established a field experiment in which the abundance of insect
   herbivores (top-down) and soil nitrogen (bottom-up) were manipulated
   over six years in an existing old-field community. We tracked plant and
   diversity - within plot richness and among plot biodiversity- and
   aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) over the course of the
   experiment. We found that bottom-up factors affected ANPP while top-down
   factors influenced plant community structure. Across years, while N
   reduction lowered ANPP by 10\%, N reduction did not alter ANPP relative
   to control plots. Further, N reduction lowered ANPP by 20\% relative to
   N addition plots. On the other hand, the reduction of insect herbivores
   did not alter plant richness ( diversity) yet consistently promoted
   Shannon's evenness, relative to plots where insect herbivores were
   present. Further, insect herbivores promoted spatial-temporal diversity.
   Overall, we found that the relative importance of top-down and bottom-up

Abstract = {{Biodiversity experiments have shown that productivity usually increases
   with plant species richness. However, most of those studies disregarded
   the importance of trophic interactions to the diversity-productivity
   relationship, and focused on the loss of native species while ignoring
   invasions by exotic species. Yet, as functional complementarity and the
   impact of plant antagonists are likely to differ between native and
   exotic communities, the diversity-productivity relationship may change
   when native communities are invaded by exotic species. We conducted a
   mesocosm experiment to test how diversity effects, evenness, and
   productivity differed between exotic and native assemblages of grassland
   plants, and how these communities were influenced by slug herbivory. In
   line with other experiments, we found higher productivity in exotic than
   in native communities. However, different mechanisms (complementarity
   vs. selection effect) contributed to the positive diversity-productivity
   relationships in exotic vs. native communities. Against expectations,
   native communities showed much lower evenness and a greater selection
   effect, suggesting that competitive dominance among native species may
   be even stronger than among exotic species. Slug herbivory decreased
   productivity independently of species origin and species diversity.
   However, exotic communities showed a threefold higher complementarity
   effect than native communities in the absence of slugs, which was mainly
   driven by differences in the responses of native and exotic legumes and
   nonleguminous herbs. Our results imply that underlying mechanisms for
   the positive diversity-productivity relationship differ between native
   and exotic communities in the early stages of community development, and
   that differential responses of plant functional groups to generalist
   herbivory can contribute to this pattern.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat loss and degradation are primary threats to amphibians and
   reptiles, but the relative effects of common land uses on assemblages
   and the mechanisms that underlie faunal responses are poorly studied. We
   reviewed the effects of four prevalent types of habitat alteration
   (urbanization, agriculture, livestock grazing, and silviculture) on
   amphibian and reptile species richness and abundance by summarizing
   reported responses in the literature and by estimating effect sizes
   across studies for species richness in each land-use type. We then used
   a multinomial model to classify species as natural habitat specialists,
   generalists, and disturbed habitat specialists and examined variation in
   effect sizes for each land-use type according to habitat specialization
   categories. There were mixed conclusions from individual studies, some
   reporting negative, neutral, or positive effects of land use on species
   richness and total abundance. A large proportion of studies reported
   species-specific effects of individual species abundance. However, in
   our analysis of effect sizes, we found a general trend of negative
   effects of land use on species richness. We also demonstrate that
   habitat associations of common species and species turnover can explain
   variation in the effect of land use on herpetofauna. Our review
   highlights the pervasive negative effects of common land uses on
   amphibians and reptiles, the importance of identifying groups vulnerable
   to land-use change (e.g., forest-associated species) in conservation
   studies, and the potential influence of disturbance-associated species
   on whole assemblage analyses.
   La Importancia de Definir los Ensamblajes Focales cuando se Evaluan las

   respuestas de la fauna estan poco documentados. Revisamos los efectos de
   cuatro tipos predominantes de alteracion de habitat (urbanizacion,

   especies y la abundancia de anfibios y reptiles al resumir las
   respuestas reportadas en la bibliografia y al estimar los tamanos del

   los efectos negativos generalizados de los usos comunes de suelo sobre
   los anfibios y los reptiles, la importancia de identificar a los grupos

Abstract = {{Biodiversity declines have been driven by land-use changes in
   semi-natural grasslands worldwide. This is thought to be because
   threatened species are unable to compete with generalist species, which
   are better adapted to the new environments created by modern land-use
   management. Many studies have separately examined biodiversity declines
   resulting from land abandonment and intensified use, however few have
   examined their unified effects on biodiversity. In addition, we still do
   not fully understand the relative importance of decreasing habitat area
   in comparison to changes in land-use practice with regard to
   biodiversity. To clarify the roles of these interconnected variables, we
   compared the diversity of threatened and common herbivorous insects and
   plants among four land-use types (traditional, annual burning, annual
   mowing, and abandoned) during 2012 and 2013. Next, we examined whether a
   relationship exists between herbivorous insects and environmental
   variables (species richness of plants, as well as current and historical
   grassland areas). We showed that land-use changes (annual burning,
   annual mowing and/or land abandonment) diminished the diversity of
   threatened butterflies, orthopterans, and plants. Herbivorous insects
   were affected by land-use practices rather than grassland area. Our
   results suggest that to conserve threatened species in semi-natural
   grasslands, we should reintroduce traditional land-use practices in
   areas that currently experience modern practices, such as annual mowing
   and burning. The reintroduction of traditional management practices
   would allow for the recovery of plant biodiversity, thereby increasing
   herbivorous insect diversity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Questions: How has vegetation species diversity and species composition
   changed between 1965 and 2012/13 in acidic and calcareous grasslands?
   What has driven this change in vegetation?
   Location: A 2400-km(2) area around Sheffield, northern England.
   Methods: In 1965 a survey was conducted to describe grassland vegetation
   of the Sheffield region. We repeated this survey in 2012/13, revisiting
   acidic and calcareous grassland sites (455 quadrats). Climate, N and
   sulphur deposition, cattle and sheep stocking rates, soil pH, altitude,
   aspect and slope were considered to be potential drivers of variation in
   vegetation. We analysed temporal changes in vegetation and examined
   relationships with spatial and temporal variation in driver variables.
   Results: Both acidic and calcareous grasslands showed clear changes in
   species composition between the two time periods. In acidic grasslands
   there was no significant change in richness but there were declines in
   diversity. There were significant increases in Ellenberg N. Nitrogen
   deposition and grazing were identified as potential drivers of spatial
   and temporal patterns but it was not possible to discriminate the
   respective impacts of potential drivers. In calcareous grasslands there
   were declines in species richness, diversity and appropriate diversity
   indices. Climate and soil pH were identified as potential drivers of
   spatial and temporal patterns.
   Conclusions: Despite only small site losses compared to other surveys in
   the UK, especially within the national park, both calcareous and acidic
   grasslands showed very clear changes in species composition. In acidic
   grasslands, high abundance of Pteridium aquilinum was a particular
   problem and had increased considerably between the two survey periods.
   Atmospheric N deposition and grazing were identified as drivers of
   species diversity. A number of calcareous grasslands showed signs of
   reduced management intensity leading to scrub invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: What is the impact of nitrogen (N) inputs on the vegetation
   of mountain permanent grasslands? Beyond the effect of fertilizer
   quantity (total and available N supply), is there a specific effect of
   fertilizer quality (the various N sources) on the multiple biodiversity
   facets of plant communities?
   Location: Jura Mountains (France).
   Methods: Based on a vegetation and agronomic survey of 29 mown
   grasslands, we considered taxonomic, phylogenetic and multi-trait
   functional diversity indices as well as community-weighted means of
   seven functional traits (CWMs) including CSR strategies. Using partial
   redundancy analysis (pRDA) and Spearman correlations, we assessed the
   response of these biodiversity metrics to (1) the medium-term total N
   input and the short-term available N input of any origin, and (2) the
   relative contribution of industrial fertilizers, solid manure, liquid
   manure, livestock restitutions and atmospheric deposition to the amount
   of available N added to the soil during the year preceding vegetation
   sampling.
   Results: We report significant negative rank correlations between total
   or available N input and two diversity metrics: species richness and
   functional richness. Among CWMs, high N inputs were positively
   correlated with specific leaf area (SLA), competitive and ruderal
   strategies, and negatively with seed mass and stress-tolerant strategy.
   Results also revealed various trends according to the N source: when the
   proportion of available N from livestock restitutions was high, plant
   communities showed higher taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity and lower
   leaf dry matter content. In contrast, communities receiving mainly
   industrial fertilizers showed lower taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity
   and higher SLA. Moreover, pRDA suggested contrasting impacts of the main
   N source on life strategies: R strategy appeared more favoured by a high
   proportion of industrial fertilizers, while C strategy was enhanced by
   liquid or solid manure.
   Conclusions: Our observations support the common finding that a high N
   supply impacts plant functional composition and is associated with a
   decrease in species richness through the loss of stress-tolerant
   species. In addition, they show that biodiversity patterns mostly depend
   on fertilizer origin. In particular, industrial fertilizers appear to be
   the most detrimental sources of nutrients for both taxonomic and
   phylogenetic diversity in mountain grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Restoring biodiversity-rich grasslands within cultivated matrices
   represents a real conservation challenge. One set of options consists in
   adopting less disruptive mowing regimes, as mowing impacts on
   invertebrates can be considerable. We experimentally tested the effect
   on butterfly populations of a spatio-temporal modification of mowing
   regimes within extensively managed meadows. The control regime (C)
   followed the standard Swiss agri-environment schemes (AES) regulation:
   no cutting before 15 June and no fertilisation. The second regime
   consisted of delaying (D) the first possible cut by one month (to 15
   July). The third regime consisted in maintaining a 10-20\% uncut grass
   refuge (R) during mowing operations. This experiment was replicated at
   12 study sites across the Swiss lowlands, and applied yearly since 2010.
   Butterflies were sampled in 2013. Butterflies generally benefitted from
   D- and R-regimes. Before the onset of mowing operations, both D- and
   R-regimes yielded higher butterfly densities (+ 70\%) compared to the
   C-regime, demonstrating positive cumulative effects (i.e. carry-over
   effects from one year to the next), not only for the whole butterfly
   community, but also for resident, multivoltine, mono- and oligophagous
   species. After 15 June, densities were about six times higher in D than
   in C- and R-meadows until D-meadows were cut mid-July. Species richness
   of specialist butterflies was significantly higher in R-meadows (+60\%)
   compared to C-meadows. This study is the first that demonstrates
   positive and cumulative effects of delaying the first cut or leaving a
   refuge on butterfly populations. It would be easy to implement these
   measures within European and Swiss AES regulations. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Understanding how land-use changes affect different facets of plant
   biodiversity in seminatural European grasslands is of particular
   importance for biodiversity conservation. As conclusions of previous
   experimental or synchronic observational studies did not converge toward
   a general agreement, assessing the recent trends in vegetation change in
   various grassland systems using a diachronic approach is needed. In this
   resurvey study, we investigated the recent changes in grassland
   vegetation of the French Jura Mountains, a region with a long tradition
   of pastoralism. We compared the floristic composition of 150 grassland
   plots recorded between 1990 and 2000 with new releves made in 2012 on
   the same plots. We considered taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional
   diversity as well as ecological characteristics of the plant communities
   derived from ecological indicator values and life strategies of the
   species. PCA of the floristic composition revealed a significant general
   trend linked to the sampling year. Wilcoxon paired tests showed that
   contemporary communities were generally more dominated by grass species
   and presented a higher tolerance to defoliation, a higher pastoral
   value, and a higher nutrient indicator value. Comparisons revealed a
   decrease in phylogenetic and functional diversity. By contrast, local
   species richness has slightly increased. The intensity of change in
   species composition, measured by Hellinger distance between pairs of
   releves, was dependent on neither the time lag between the two surveys,
   the author of the first releve nor its location or elevation. The most
   important changes were observed in grasslands that previously presented
   low pastoral value, low grass cover, low tolerance to defoliation, and
   high proportion of stress-tolerant species. This trend was likely linked
   to the intensification of grassland management reported in the region,
   with a parallel increase in mowing frequency, grazing pressure, and
   fertilization level. More restrictive specifications should be applied
   to agricultural practices to avoid overexploitation of mountain
   species-rich grasslands and its negative consequences on their
   biodiversity and resilience.}},

Title = {{Habitat engineering by beaver benefits aquatic biodiversity and

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{486-499}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Small-scale discontinuities, formed by accumulations of wood, are
   recognised as a key feature of functionally intact forested streams
   because they promote organic matter retention, increase habitat
   complexity and provide flow refugia. Re-establishing such features in
   physically degraded streams is therefore a common priority for
   restoration schemes. Ecosystem engineering by beavers in the form of dam
   building might offer a natural mechanism for restoring degraded streams.
   Despite an increase in beaver reintroductions globally, the ecosystem
   engineering concept has rarely been applied to restoring biodiversity
   and ecosystem function, especially within degraded freshwater systems.
   2. By comparing multiple beaver-modified and unmodified sites on
   headwater streams draining 13 ha of pastureland in eastern Scotland,
   U.K., we investigated if hydromorphological changes caused by
   reintroduced beavers ( Castor fiber) translate into desirable biological
   responses when there is a long history of physical degradation and
   contraction of the regional species pool due to agricultural land use.
   3. Beaver modified in-stream habitat by constructing 10 dams, thus
   creating a series of interconnected dam pools. Organic matter retention
   and aquatic plant biomass increased ( 7 and 20 fold higher respectively)
   in beaver ponds relative to unmodified channels, consistent with the
   lower fluctuation in stream stage observed below a series of dams.
   Growing season concentrations of extractable P and NO3 were on average
   49\% and 43\% lower respectively below a series of dams than above,
   although colour and suspended solids concentrations increased.
   4. Macroinvertebrate samples from beaver-modified habitats were less
   taxon rich ( alpha diversity on average 27\% lower) than those from
   unmodified stream habitat. However, due to significant compositional
   differences between beaver versus unmodified habitats, a composite
   sample from all habitats indicated increased richness at the landscape
   scale; gamma diversity was 28\% higher on average than in the absence of
   beaver-modified habitat. Feeding guild composition shifted from
   grazer/scraper and filter feeder dominance in unmodified habitats to
   shredder and collector-gatherer dominance in beaver-created habitats.
   5. Dam building by beaver in degraded environments can improve physical
   and biological diversity when viewed at a scale encompassing both
   modified and unmodified habitats. By restoring ecosystem processes
   locally, it may also offer wider scale benefits, including greater
   nutrient retention and flood attenuation. These benefits should be
   evaluated against evidence of any negative effects on land use or
   fisheries.}},

Abstract = {{African savannas are complex socio-ecological systems with diverse wild
   and domestic herbivore assemblages, which adapt spatially to intra- and
   interannual variation in forage quantity and quality, predation and
   disease risks. As African savannas become increasingly fragmented by
   growing human populations and their associated ecological impacts,
   adaptive foraging options for wild and domestic herbivore populations
   are correspondingly limited, resulting in declining wildlife populations
   and impoverished pastoral societies. In addition, competition for
   grazing by expanding domestic herbivore populations threatens the
   viability of wild herbivore populations occupying similar grazing
   niches. Conservation initiatives are further impacted by conflicts
   between wildlife and local communities of people who often receive
   little benefit from adjacent protected areas, creating conflict between
   the livelihood-orientated goals of communities and the
   conservation-oriented goals of the international community and those
   with vested interests in wildlife. Conservation strategies facilitating
   the alignment of these opposing goals of communities and
   conservationists are needed.Synthesis and applications. Key to

   herbivores can be managed to minimize competition with wild herbivores

   the landscape and facilitation of high-quality grazing. Ecosystem
   service benefits to communities through controlled access to grazing

   genera and 22 families were identified. Four Tenebrionidae dominated the
   catch, Mesostena puncticollis Solier, Oxycara saudarabica Kaszab,
   Gonocephalum prolixum (Erichson) and Apentanodes arabicus (Kirchsberg).
   Although richness and abundance did not differ significantly between the
   locations, diversity and evenness were different. The beetle family
   abundance showed variations between the locations. Non-metric
   multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and the analysis of similarity (ANOSIM)
   showed a high dissimilarity degree in species composition. Scavengers
   occurred in higher abundance and richness in one location. Predators and
   herbivores occurred in higher abundances in the other location. This
   study suggests that scavengers can be used for monitoring the ecology
   integrity in xeric-lands. It revealed the difficulty of interpreting
   richness and diversity measures without a high species identification
   level and knowledge about feeding guilds. Our findings will assist in
   monitoring approaches for conservation of natural habitats in arid
   lands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological intensification promotes the better use of ecosystem
   functioning for agricultural production and as a provider of additional
   regulation and cultural services. We investigated the mechanisms
   underpinning potential ecological intensification of livestock
   production in the Vercors mountains (France). We quantified the
   variations in seven ecosystem properties associated with key ecosystem
   services: above-ground biomass production at first harvest, fodder
   digestibility, plant species richness, soil organic matter content, soil
   carbon content, total microbial biomass and soil bacteria:fungi ratio
   across 39 grassland plots representing varying management types and
   intensity. Our analyses confirmed joint effects of management, traits
   and soil abiotic parameters on variations in ecosystem properties, with
   the combination of management and traits being most influential. The
   variations explained by traits were consistent with the leaf economics
   spectrum model and its implications for ecosystem functioning. The
   observed independence between ecosystem properties relevant to
   production (forage biomass, digestibility and nutrient turnover) on the
   one hand and soil stocks (organic matter, carbon and microbial stocks)
   on the other hand suggests that an intensification of fodder production
   might be compatible with the preservation of the soil capital. We
   highlight that appropriate choices regarding various practices, such as
   the first date of grazing or mowing being dependent on soil moisture,
   have important consequences on a number of ecosystem properties relevant
   for ecosystem services and may influence biodiversity patterns. Such
   avenues for ecological intensification should be considered as part of
   further landscape- and farm-scale analyses of the relationships between
   farm functioning and ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Forecasting impacts of future climate change is an important challenge
   to biologists, both for understanding the consequences of different
   emissions trajectories and for developing adaptation measures that will
   minimize biodiversity loss. Existing variation provides a window into
   the effects of climate on species and ecosystems, but in many places
   does not encompass the levels or timeframes of forcing expected under
   directional climatic change. Experiments help us to fill in these
   uncertainties, simulating directional shifts to examine outcomes of new
   levels and sustained changes in conditions. Here, we explore the
   translation between short-term responses to climate variability and
   longer-term trajectories that emerge under directional climatic change.
   In a decade-long experiment, we compare effects of short-term and
   long-term forcings across three trophic levels in grassland plots
   subjected to natural and experimental variation in precipitation. For
   some biological responses (plant productivity), responses to long-term
   extension of the rainy season were consistent with short-term responses,
   while for others (plant species richness, abundance of invertebrate
   herbivores and predators), there was pronounced divergence of long-term
   trajectories from short-term responses. These differences between
   biological responses mean that sustained directional changes in climate
   can restructure ecological relationships characterizing a system.
   Importantly, a positive relationship between plant diversity and
   productivity turned negative under one scenario of climate change, with
   a similar change in the relationship between plant productivity and
   consumer biomass. Inferences from experiments such as this form an
   important part of wider efforts to understand the complexities of

Abstract = {{The stable delivery of ecosystem services provided by grasslands is

   this study is to evaluate to what extent species-poor intensively
   managed agricultural grasslands can maintain their biomass productivity
   under climate anomalies, as compared to species-rich, semi-natural

   production over time. Biomass production stability was assessed in
   response to drought and temperature anomalies using 14years of the
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), temperature and drought
   index time series. More specifically, vegetation resistance (i.e. the
   ability to withstand the climate anomaly) and resilience (i.e. the
   recovery rate) were derived using an auto-regressive model with external
   input variables (ARx). The stability metrics for both grasslands were
   subsequently compared. We found that semi-natural grasslands exhibited a
   higher resistance but lower resilience than agricultural grasslands in
   the Netherlands. Furthermore, the difference in stability between
   semi-natural and agricultural grasslands was dependent on the physical
   geography: the most significant differences in resistance were observed

Abstract = {{Nearly 60\% of European wetlands have been lost to drainage or to the
   cessation of grassland management. Large amounts of resources are put
   into wetland restoration with the aim to recover biodiversity. However,
   few studies have simultaneously evaluated effects of management, wetness
   and flooding dynamics on biodiversity of restored wetlands such as
   seasonally flooded wet grasslands. We inventoried bird communities over
   4years at 137 sites (each 31ha) within five restored wet grassland areas
   in Sweden to investigate whether species richness and occurrence of 12
   common wet grassland species were related to (i) local conditions such
   as management (grazing, mowing and unmanaged areas), basic wetness and
   spring flooding dynamics. Further, we investigated whether (ii) the
   composition of the adjacent landscape (20ha) related to local bird
   diversity and (iii) species turnover (i.e. beta diversity) differed
   between sites characterized by their basic wetness, degree of flooding
   and predominant management regime. Local species richness was positively
   linked to degree of flooding and basic wetness of grasslands but not to
   type of grassland management. Species richness tended also to be
   negatively linked to proportion of forest at the landscape scale.
   Although variable, the same results were also true concerning the
   probability of the occurrence of a single species at the local scale.
   Species turnover between sites, and thus total species richness, was
   distinctly higher in (i) grazed as compared to mowed grasslands except
   in dry non-flooded grasslands and (ii) flooded as compared to
   non-flooded sites. Similar patterns held for the subset of 12 red-listed
   species. We suggest that the high beta diversity in grazed and flooded
   grasslands is driven by the heterogeneous vegetation structure,
   resulting in good conditions for foraging and nesting for several wet
   grassland bird species.Synthesis and applications. The selection of
   wetlands for conserving wet grassland birds should prioritize temporary
   flooded grasslands of moderate wetness, preferably far from forest
   edges. Restoration and management of wet grasslands should include water
   level management, removal of shrubs and trees, and low-intensity
   grazing, whereas mowing could be used in non-flooded grasslands of low
   basic wetness.

Abstract = {{Invasive species threaten agriculture by changing agroecosystem
   structure and function, reducing habitat value, decreasing biodiversity
   and ecosystem services and increasing management costs. Grazing lands in
   south central Florida are a mosaic of sown pastures, native grasslands,
   wetlands and woodlands that provide a variety of ecosystem services.
   Disturbance of these pastures and native grasslands by invasive feral
   swine (Sus scrofa) can have negative consequences for both economic
   productivity and biodiversity. In this study, we show that the effect of
   rooting on plant diversity depends on ecosystem type and initial levels
   of plant species diversity. For example, in native grassland pasture,
   rooting was initially associated with declines in plant species
   richness, while in sown pastures, rooting was associated with more
   sustained increases in plant species richness. In both sown pastures and
   native grasslands, swine rooting altered plant community composition
   reducing agricultural productivity. Forage grasses were primarily
   associated with unrooted areas, whereas low quality forage species or
   nuisance species were found in rooted areas. We provide an example of
   monetary losses that cattle ranches can incur when feral swine are
   abundant on the landscape and control is minimal. Ranch managers and
   government agencies are encouraged to consider implementing more
   stringent feral swine management programs to minimize negative effects

Abstract = {{In recent years, haying has extended to Iberian Mediterranean dry
   grasslands potentially threatening grassland birds. We evaluate the
   between and within-year effects of haying on grassland birds in Alentejo
   region, Portugal. Our main goals were: (1) to investigate variations on
   bird abundance and species richness in the fields hayed, with respect to
   past haying events occurred in a field and its surroundings and; (2) to
   investigate the shifts in bird abundance, species richness and spatial
   dynamics resulting from haying a field and its surrounding area in a
   given year. We conducted grassland bird censuses during the breeding
   season through point counts from 2012 to 2015. The relationship between
   bird abundance/richness and past haying events was investigated using
   Generalized Linear Models whereas within-year effects of haying were
   analysed using Generalized Additive Models. Bird abundance in a field
   was positively related with the surface hayed in the vicinity of that
   field in the previous year. However, contrasting yearly effects were
   found for non passerines. Also, some species prefer fields with less
   haying events or surface hayed, whereas others occur mostly in fields
   frequently managed for haying. Haying a field leads, in the short term,
   to its abandonment by birds, and thus to a decrease in bird abundance
   and, for some species, to spatial concentration in surrounding fields
   offering suitable habitat. We conclude that within-year effects of
   haying have higher impact on grassland birds than between-year effects.
   Maintaining haying at low levels by rotating haying yearly through the
   different fields in each farm and using partial haying may be an
   adequate way to ensure an effective management of grassland bird

   were planted with various species combinations (1-20) and subjected to 5

   treatments (yearly fall mowing or no mowing). In general, we found the
   belowground variables (root length, surface area, number of tips, and
   number of branches) to be relatively unresponsive to the nutrient and
   mowing treatments. For instance, average root length was 309, 315, and
   300 cm in the nitrogen, phosphorus, and control plots, respectively. In
   contrast, the aboveground variables exhibited pronounced responses to
   nitrogen applications (200 kg/ha year). Nitrogen applications increased
   aboveground biomass (660 vs. 265 g/m 2, respectively) and reduced
   average species richness compared to the control (3.25 species vs. 7.29

   the plots that received nitrogen were able to support more aboveground

   grasslands were relatively resistant to the compost addition, but
   responses of some individual species were observed. Notably at the
   valley grassland, the abundance of forbs decreased slightly, while the
   abundance of grasses increased. The abundance of two noxious weeds did
   not change as a result of the compost amendment. Our results suggest
   that a single application of composted organic matter used to sequester
   C provided cobenefits to grassland plant dynamics. The compost
   amendments produced sustained increases in plant productivity and forage
   production as well as plant N content without greatly affecting the
   diversity of these exotic annual grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Rumex obtusifolius is a troublesome weed especially in organically
   managed grasslands. Manual weeding is commonly used for R. obtusifolius
   control, but its effectiveness and effect on plant species composition
   in upland grassland has never been investigated. Therefore the aim of
   our study was to reveal the effect of manual weeding by digging out R.
   obtusifolius taproots to depths of 5 or 15 cm, either once or twice, in:
   (i) presence of R. obtusifolius plants; (ii) plant species composition.
   Additional treatments were grazed and unmanaged grassland (both without
   digging out R. obtusifolius taproot). Digging out taproots twice, to 15
   cm, reduced the presence of R. obtusifolius significantly. Grazing
   without digging out taproots was the treatment that was most favourable
   for R. obtusifolius plants. Manual weeding had no significant effect on
   species richness. The empty spaces after plant removal were filled by
   nutrient-demanding species (Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Festuca
   pratensis and Lolium perenne, Trifolium repens and Taraxacum sp.). On
   unmanaged grassland the number of R. obtusifolius plants decreased,
   species richness was reduced, but this allowed the spread of other tall
   weedy species (Urtica dioica, Galium album and Elytrigia repens).
   Digging out taproots to a depth of 15 cm, performed twice, can be an
   effective method for R. obtusifolius control in organically managed
   grasslands, as this procedure eliminated the majority of R. obtusifolius
   plants. However, the use of this weeding method over large areas of
   grassland is limited due to time-consuming and hard physical work.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands play important roles in ecosystem production and support a
   large farming and grazing industry. An accurate and efficient way is
   needed to estimate grassland health and production for monitoring and
   adjusting management to get sustainable products and other ecosystem
   services. Previous studies of grasslands have shown varying
   relationships between productivity and biodiversity, with most showing
   either a positive or a hump-shaped relationship where productivity peaks
   at intermediate diversity. In this study, we used airborne imaging
   spectrometry combined with ground sampling and eddy covariance
   measurements to estimate the spatial pattern of production and
   biodiversity for two sites of contrasting productivity in a southern
   Alberta prairie ecosystem. Resulting patterns revealed that more diverse
   sites generally had greater productivity, supporting the hypothesis of a
   positive relationship between production and biodiversity for this site.
   We showed that the addition of evenness to richness (using the Shannon
   Index of dominant species instead of the number of dominant species
   alone) improved the correlation with optical diversity, an optically
   derived metric of biodiversity based on the coefficient of variation in
   spectral reflectance across space. Similarly, the Shannon Index was
   better correlated with productivity (estimated via NDVI (Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index)) than the number of dominant species alone.
   Optical diversity provided a potent proxy for other more traditional
   biodiversity metrics (richness and Shannon index). Coupling field
   measurements and imaging spectrometry provides a method for assessing
   grassland productivity and biodiversity at a larger scale than can be
   sampled from the ground, and allows the integrated analysis of the
   productivity-biodiversity relationship over large areas.}},

Abstract = {{Intensification of land use reduces biodiversity but may also shift the
   trait composition of communities. Understanding how land use affects
   single traits and community trait composition, helps to understand why
   some species are more affected by land use than others. Trait-based
   analyses are common for plants, but rare for arthropods. We collected
   literature-based traits for nearly 1000 insect and spider species to
   test how land-use intensity (including mowing, fertilization, and
   grazing) across 124 grasslands in three regions of Germany affects
   community-weighted mean traits across taxa and in single taxa. We
   additionally measured morphometric traits for more than 150 Heteroptera
   species and tested whether the weighted mean morphometric traits change
   with increasing land-use intensity. Community average body size
   decreased and community average dispersal ability increased from low to
   high land-use intensity. Furthermore, the relative abundance of
   herbivores and of specialists among herbivores decreased and the
   relative abundance of species using the herb layer increased with
   increasing land-use intensity. Community-weighted means of the
   morphometric traits in Heteroptera also changed from low to high
   land-use intensity toward longer and thinner shapes as well as longer
   appendices (legs, wings, and antenna). While changes in traits with
   increasing mowing and fertilization intensity were consistent with the
   combined land-use intensity, community average traits did often not
   change or with opposite direction under increasing grazing intensity. We
   conclude that high land-use intensity acts as an environmental filter
   selecting for on average smaller, more mobile, and less specialized
   species across taxa. Although trait collection across multiple arthropod
   taxa is laborious and needs clear trait definitions, it is essential for
   understanding the functional consequences of biodiversity loss due to
   land-use intensification.}},

Journal = {{ECOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{338-348}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Semi-natural meadows host a great number of species coexisting at fine
   spatial scales. Different assembly mechanisms, related to differences in
   functional traits between species, can influence such coexistence.
   Coexisting species could be either functionally dissimilar to occupy
   different niches (divergence') or functionally similar due to exclusion
   of species with traits less adapted to the prevailing abiotic and biotic
   conditions (convergence'). Various theories differently predict how
   trait convergence and divergence should differ due to disturbance, along
   productivity gradients, and across different functional traits. We
   tested such theories in 21 wet meadows of different productivity in
   central Europe. In each meadow, four 1 x 1 m plots were established in
   which disturbance by mowing was combined with fertilization. Species
   presence was recorded in 100 quadrats 10 x 10 cm in size within the
   plots over five years. Convergence and divergence were assessed at very
   fine spatial scales (10 x 10 cm) to focus on the processes driven by the
   interactions for similar resources. Convergence emerged as the dominant
   pattern for all traits and across all years. It was particularly strong
   in the least productive conditions while divergence emerged in some of
   the most productive meadows. Mowing increased convergence in meadows
   with low productivity, but increased divergence in productive meadows.
   Fertilization generally increased convergence, with this increase being
   more pronounced in mown plots. Convergence in unproductive conditions
   could be caused by either higher fitness of stress-tolerant species
   (more abundant in the species pool of these sites) or by functionally
   similar species sharing similar patches within fine-scale heterogeneous
   plots. This outcome also suggests abiotic filters can have an important
   role at fine scales, where plant-ecological theory usually predicts the
   prevalence of biotic processes.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity is important for ecosystem functioning and biotic
   interactions. In experimental grasslands, increasing plant species
   richness is known to increase the diversity of associated herbivores and
   their predators. If these interactions can also involve endosymbionts
   that reside within a plant or animal host is currently unknown. In
   plant-feeding aphids, secondary bacterial symbionts can have strong
   fitness effects on the host, e.g. resistance to natural enemies or
   fungal pathogens. We examined the secondary symbiont community in three
   species of aphid, each feeding on a unique host plant across
   experimental plots that varied in plant species richness. Aphids were
   collected in May and June, and the symbiont community identified using
   species-specific PCR assays. Aphis fabae aphids were found to host six
   different symbiont species with individual aphids co-hosting up to four
   symbionts. Uroleucon jaceae and Macrosiphum rosae hosted two and three
   symbiont species, respectively. We found that, at the aphid population
   level, increasing plant species richness increased the diversity of the
   aphid symbiont community, whereas at the individual aphid level, the
   opposite was found. These effects are potentially driven by varying
   selective pressures across different plant communities of varying
   diversities, mediated by defensive protection responses and a changing
   cost-benefit trade-off to the aphid for hosting multiple secondary
   symbionts. Our work extends documented effects of plant diversity beyond
   visible biotic interactions to changes in endosymbiont communities, with
   potentially far-reaching consequences to related ecosystem processes.}},

Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{A deeper understanding of past vegetation dynamics is required to better
   assess future vegetation responses to global warming in the Alps. Lake
   sediments from Lac de Bretaye, a small subalpine lake in the Northern
   Swiss Alps (1780 m a.s.l.), were analysed to reconstruct past vegetation
   dynamics for the entire Holocene, using pollen, macrofossil and charcoal
   analyses as main proxies. The results show that timberline reached the
   lake's catchment area at around 10,300 cal. BP, supporting the
   hypothesis of a delayed postglacial afforestation in the Northern Alps.
   At the same time, thermophilous trees such as Ulmus, Tilia and Acer
   established in the lowlands and expanded to the altitude of the lake,
   forming distinctive boreo-nemoral forests with Betula, Pinus cembra and
   Larix decidua. From about 5000 to 3500 cal. BP, thermophilous trees
   declined because of increasing human land use, mainly driven by the mass
   expansion of Picea abies and severe anthropogenic fire activity. From
   the Bronze Age onwards (c. 4200-2800 cal. BP), grazing indicators and
   high values for charcoal concentration and influx attest an intensifying
   human impact, fostering the expansion of Alnus viridis and Picea abies.
   Hence, biodiversity in alpine meadows increased, whereas forest
   diversity declined, as can be seen in other regional records. We argue
   that the anticipated climate change and decreasing human impact in the
   Alps today will not only lead to an upward movement of timberline with
   consequent loss of area for grasslands, but also to a disruption of
   Picea abies forests, which may allow the re-expansion of thermophilous
   tree species.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionThe empirical evidence of root herbivory effects on plant
   community composition and co-existence is contradictory. This originates
   from difficulties connected to below-ground research and confinement of
   experimental studies to a small range of environmental conditions. Here
   we suggest coupling experimental data with an individual-based model to
   overcome the limitations inherent in either approach. To demonstrate
   this, we investigated the consequences of root herbivory, as
   experimentally observed on individual plants, on plant competition and
   co-existence in a population and community context under different root
   herbivory intensities (RHI), fluctuating and constant root herbivore
   activity and grazing along a resource gradient.
   LocationBerlin, Germany, glasshouse; Potsdam, Germany, high performance
   cluster computer.
   MethodsThe well-established community model IBC-Grass was adapted to
   allow for a flexible species parameterization and to include annual
   species. Experimentally observed root herbivory effects on performance
   of eight common grassland plant species were incorporated into the model
   by altering plant growth rates. We then determined root herbivore
   effects on plant populations, competitive hierarchy and consequences for
   co-existence and community diversity.
   ResultsRoot herbivory reduced individual biomass, but temporal
   fluctuation allowed for compensation of herbivore effects. Reducing
   resource availability strongly shifted competitive hierarchies, with,
   however, more similar hierarchies along the gradient under root
   herbivory, pointing to reduced ecological species differences.
   Consequently, negative effects on co-existence and diversity prevailed,
   with the exception of a few positive effects on co-existence of selected
   species pairs. Temporal fluctuation alleviated but did not remove
   negative root herbivore effects, despite of the stronger influence of
   intra- compared to interspecific competition. Grazing in general
   augmented co-existence. Most interestingly, grazing interacted with RHI
   and resource availability by promoting positive effects of root
   herbivory.
   ConclusionsThrough integrating experimental data on the scale of
   individual plants with a simulation model we verified that root
   herbivory could affect plant competition with consequences for species
   co-existence. Our approach demonstrates the benefit that accrues when
   empirical and modelling approaches are brought more closely together,
   and that gathering data on distinct processes and under specific
   conditions, combined with appropriate models, can be used to answer
   challenging research questions in a more general way.}},

Abstract = {{Root herbivory can influence plant interactions with other organisms by

   lanceolata plants with and without root feeding Agriotes spp. larvae
   (Coleoptera, Elateridae) in their root system in grasslands of different
   management intensity. We then determined root herbivore impacts on plant
   interactions with invertebrate shoot herbivores and root fungi. Root
   herbivory reduced length and biomass of P. lanceolata roots independent
   of land use intensity. Root colonization by non-mycorrhizal fungi
   increased with increasing cattle grazing intensity, but was unaffected
   by root herbivory. The root herbivore impact on root colonization by
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi depended on cattle grazing intensity. Root
   herbivores increased colonization under low but reduced colonization
   under high grazing intensities. Root herbivory affected P. lanceolata
   interactions with shoot herbivores, as indicated by increased leaf
   damage in the presence of root herbivores. The increase, however,
   declined with increasing mowing frequency. We conclude that land use

Abstract = {{Despite the Europe-wide protection of wetlands, knowledge on the
   performance of management strategies for biodiversity conservation
   across different trophic levels is still relatively scarce. Here, we
   compare old straw meadows with restored low-intensity pastures and with
   fallows in a fen area in the northern pre-Alps. We sampled biodiversity
   at three trophic levels including plants, leafhoppers and spiders. Plant
   species richness was significantly enhanced by grazing and mowing
   compared with fallows. In contrast, species numbers and abundances of
   leafhoppers and spiders were highest in pastures and lowest in meadows.
   Endangered plant species were relatively rare in the restored pastures,
   which were still nutrient rich compared with meadows. Thus, land-use
   history can constrain restoration success for dispersal limited plant
   species in the short term. Although fallow plots were poorer in terms of
   species richness, their leafhopper and spider assemblages were highly
   differentiated and comprised a number of exclusive species, some of
   which were endangered. Our results suggest that maximum biodiversity can
   best be maintained by the diversification of management types. Enhanced
   abundances of leafhoppers and spiders in pastures may improve prey
   availability for predators such as amphibians, reptiles, and birds.

   performed a meta-analysis of 38 independent studies from 32 papers to
   examine how invasive plants alter major groupings of primary and
   secondary consumers in three globally distributed ecosystems: wetlands,
   woodlands and grasslands. Within each ecosystem we examined if green
   (grazing) food webs are more sensitive to plant invasions compared to
   brown (detrital) food webs. Invasive plants have strong negative effects
   on primary consumers (detritivores, bacterivores, fungivores, and/or
   herbivores) in woodlands and wetlands, which become less abundant in
   both green and brown food webs in woodlands and green webs in wetlands.
   Plant invasions increased abundances of secondary consumers (predators
   and/or parasitoids) only in woodland brown food webs and green webs in
   wetlands. Effects of invasive plants on grazing and detrital food webs
   clearly differed between ecosystems. Overall, invasive plants had the
   most pronounced effects on the trophic structure of wetlands and
   woodlands, but caused no detectable changes to grassland trophic
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{South-central Africa is characterized by an archipelago of wetlands,
   which has evolved in time and space since at least the Miocene,
   providing refugia for animal species during Pleistocene arid episodes.
   Their importance for biodiversity in the region is reflected in the
   evolution of a variety of specialist mammal and bird species, adapted to
   exploit these wetland habitats. Populations of lions (Panthera leo)
   across south-central and east Africa have contrasting signatures of
   mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and biparental nuclear DNA in wetland and
   savannah habitats, respectively, pointing to the evolution of distinct
   habitat preferences. This explains the absence of genetic admixture of
   populations from the Kalahari savannah of southwest Botswana and the
   Okavango wetland of northern Botswana, despite separation by only 500
   km. We postulate that ancestral lions were wetland specialists and that
   the savannah lions evolved from populations that were isolated during
   arid Pleistocene episodes. Expansion of grasslands and the resultant
   increase in herbivore populations during mesic Pleistocene climatic
   episodes provided the stimulus for the rapid population expansion and
   diversification of the highly successful savannah lion specialists. Our

Abstract = {{We assessed ecological sustainability of seminatural forestry by
   analyzing 80-year dynamics and the current distribution of all
   woodpecker species in Estonia. We found that, despite the
   clear-cutting-based forestry system, woodpeckers inhabited commercial
   seminatural forests in substantial numbers, including the species
   generally considered vulnerable to timber harvesting. The only negative
   trend, a drastic decline in the Green Woodpecker, paralleled the loss of
   seminatural, wooded grasslands and is mostly an issue for landscape
   planning and agricultural land use. Major silvicultural factors
   supporting other species in commercial forests include natural
   regeneration with multiple native tree species and deadwood abundance.
   In such context, the main role of protected areas is to provide
   ecological resilience; however, we estimated that the current strict
   reserves could further double their carrying capacities for woodpeckers
   through successional recovery and, perhaps, active restoration. The long
   time series used were instrumental in detecting unexpected dynamics and
   the impacts of climatically extreme years. We conclude that (1)
   seminatural forestry can serve as a basis for reconciling timber
   harvesting and biodiversity protection at the landscape scale, given
   appropriate attention to key structures and landscape zoning and (2)
   woodpeckers represent a biological indicator system for the
   sustainability of forest landscapes in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{1. Oases in arid regions of northwestern China are main sites for
   agriculture and human settlement. Conservation of these important oasis
   habitats involves establishing shrub shelterbelts around the oases. We
   investigated how different types of shrub shelterbelts affect the
   diversity of ground beetles.
   2. We sampled carabid and tenebrionid assemblages with pitfall traps in
   spring and summer and measured key environmental variables in four
   habitats of the arid region: planted stands of pure and mixed
   plantations of two longlived shrubs (Haloxylon ammodendron and Tamarix
   ramosissima) and natural grassland (NG) from which planted systems were
   converted.
   3. Beetle abundance and species richness reduced significantly in the
   pure plantations but the mixed plantation had similar abundance and
   higher richness in spring and lower richness in summer relative to NG.
   We found differences in response between functional groups of beetles.
   The pure plantations resulted in reduced abundance and richness of
   herbivores and detritivores and increased predator abundance in spring
   and reduced predator abundance in summer. The mixed plantation resulted
   in increased detritivore richness in spring and reduced detritivore
   richness in summer as well as increased herbivore abundance in spring
   and reduced herbivore and predator abundance and richness in summer. The
   beetle community was largely determined by shrub cover and herbaceous
   plant diversity.
   4. We conclude that the pure shrub plantations reduce beetle diversity,
   whereas the mixed shrub plantation has less adverse effect on beetle
   diversity. Shrub mixtures can therefore be a practical measure to
   minimise the negative impacts of shrub shelterbelts on beetles.}},

   maintaining grassland plant diversity; and (v) improved ecosystem
   services, such as carbon sequestration, control of soil erosion and

Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Habitat diversity (spatial heterogeneity within and between habitat
   patches in a landscape, HD) is often invoked as a driver of species
   diversity at small spatial scales. However, the effect of HD on species
   richness (SR) of multiple taxa is not well understood. We quantified HD
   and SR in a wet-dry gradient of open grassland habitats in Hortobagy
   National Park (E-Hungary) and tested the effect of compositional and
   structural factors of HD on SR of flowering plants, orthopterans, true
   bugs, spiders, ground beetles and birds. Our dataset on 434 grassland
   species (170 plants, 264 animals) showed that the wet-dry gradient
   (compositional HD at the between-patch scale) was primarily related to
   SR in orthopterans, ground-dwelling arthropods, and all animals
   combined. The patchiness, or plant association richness, of the
   vegetation (compositional HD at the within-patch scale) was related to
   SR of vegetation-dwelling arthropods, whereas vegetation height
   (structural HD at the withinpatch scale) was related to SR of
   ground-dwelling arthropods and birds. Patch area was related to SR only
   in birds, whereas management (grazing, mowing, none) was related to SR
   of plants and true bugs. All relationships between HD and SR were
   positive, indicating increasing SR with increasing HD. However, total SR
   was not related to HD because different taxa showed similar positive
   responses to different HD variables. Our findings, therefore, show that
   even though HD positively influences SR in a wide range of grassland
   taxa, each taxon responds to different compositional or structural
   measures of HD, resulting in the lack of a consistent relationship
   between HD and SR when taxon responses are pooled. The idiosyncratic
   responses shown here exemplify the difficulties in detecting general
   HDSR relationships over multiple taxa. Our results also suggest that
   management and restoration aimed specifically to sustain or increase the
   diversity of habitats are required to conserve biodiversity in complex

Title = {{Genotypic richness predicts phenotypic variation in an endangered clonal
   plant}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{Declines in genetic diversity within a species can affect the stability
   and functioning of populations. The conservation of genetic diversity is
   thus a priority, especially for threatened for endangered species. The
   importance of genetic variation, however, is dependent on the degree to
   which it translates into phenotypic variation for traits that affect
   individual performance and ecological processes. This is especially
   important for predominantly clonal species, as no single clone is likely
   to maximise all aspects of performance. Here we show that intraspecific
   genotypic diversity as measured using microsatellites is a strong
   predictor of phenotypic variation in morphological traits and shoot
   productivity of the threatened, predominantly clonal seagrass Posidonia
   australis, on the east coast of Australia. Biomass and surface area
   variation was most strongly predicted by genotypic richness, while
   variation in leaf chemistry (phenolics and nitrogen) was unrelated to
   genotypic richness. Genotypic richness did not predict tissue loss to
   herbivores or epiphyte load, however we did find that increased
   herbivore damage was positively correlated with allelic richness.
   Although there was no clear relationship between higher primary
   productivity and genotypic richness, variation in shoot productivity
   within a meadow was significantly greater in more genotypically diverse
   meadows. The proportion of phenotypic variation explained by
   environmental conditions varied among different genotypes, and there was
   generally no variation in phenotypic traits among genotypes present in
   the same meadows. Our results show that genotypic richness as measured
   through the use of presumably neutral DNA markers does covary with
   phenotypic variation in functionally relevant traits such as leaf
   morphology and shoot productivity. The reniarkably long lifespan of
   individual Posidonia plants suggests that plasticity within genotypes
   has played an important role in the longevity of the species. However,
   the strong link between genotypic and phenotypic variation suggests that
   a range of genotypes is still the best case scenario for adaptation to
   and recovery from predicted environmental change.}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 9}},
Abstract = {{Changes in producer diversity cause multiple changes in consumer
   communities through various mechanisms. However, past analyses
   investigating the relationship between plant diversity and arthropod
   consumers focused only on few aspects of arthropod diversity, e.g.
   species richness and abundance. Yet, shifts in understudied facets of
   arthropod diversity like relative abundances or species dominance may
   have strong effects on arthropod-mediated ecosystem functions. Here we
   analyze the relationship between plant species richness and arthropod
   diversity using four complementary diversity indices, namely: abundance,
   species richness, evenness (equitability of the abundance distribution)
   and dominance (relative abundance of the dominant species). Along an
   experimental gradient of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60
   plant species), we sampled herbivorous and carnivorous arthropods using
   pitfall traps and suction sampling during a whole vegetation period. We
   tested whether plant species richness affects consumer diversity
   directly (i), or indirectly through increased productivity (ii).
   Further, we tested the impact of plant community composition on
   arthropod diversity by testing for the effects of plant functional
   groups (iii). Abundance and species richness of both herbivores and
   carnivores increased with increasing plant species richness, but the
   underlying mechanisms differed between the two trophic groups. While
   higher species richness in herbivores was caused by an increase in
   resource diversity, carnivore richness was driven by plant productivity.
   Evenness of herbivore communities did not change along the gradient in
   plant species richness, whereas evenness of carnivores declined. The
   abundance of dominant herbivore species showed no response to changes in
   plant species richness, but the dominant carnivores were more abundant
   in species-rich plant communities. The functional composition of plant
   communities had small impacts on herbivore communities, whereas
   carnivore communities were affected by forbs of small stature, grasses
   and legumes. Contrasting patterns in the abundance of dominant species
   imply different levels of resource specialization for dominant
   herbivores (narrow food spectrum) and carnivores (broad food spectrum).
   That in turn could heavily affect ecosystem functions mediated by
   herbivorous and carnivorous arthropods, such as herbivory or biological
   pest control.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands with grazing management are characterized by
   high fine-scale species richness and have a high conservation value. The
   fact that fine-scale surveys of grassland plant communities are
   time-consuming may limit the spatial extent of ground-based diversity
   surveys. Remote sensing tools have the potential to support field-based
   sampling and, if remote sensing data are able to identify grassland
   sites that are likely to support relatively higher or lower levels of
   species diversity, then field sampling efforts could be directed towards
   sites that are of potential conservation interest. In the present study,
   we examined whether aerial hyperspectral (414-2501 nm) remote sensing
   can be used to predict fine-scale plant species diversity (characterized
   as species richness and Simpson's diversity) in dry grazed grasslands.
   Vascular plant species were recorded within 104 (4 m x 4 m) plots on the
   island of oland (Sweden) and each plot was characterized by a
   245-waveband hyperspectral data set. We used two different modeling
   approaches to evaluate the ability of the airborne spectral measurements
   to predict within-plot species diversity: (1) a spectral response
   approach, based on reflectance information from (i) all wavebands, and
   (ii) a subset of wavebands, analyzed with a partial least squares
   regression model, and (2) a spectral heterogeneity approach, based on
   the mean distance to the spectral centroid in an ordinary least squares
   regression model. Species diversity was successfully predicted by the
   spectral response approach (with an error of ca. 20\%) but not by the
   spectral heterogeneity approach. When using the spectral response
   approach, iterative selection of important wavebands for the prediction
   of the diversity measures simplified the model but did not improve its
   predictive quality (prediction error). Wavebands sensitive to plant
   pigment content (400-700 nm) and to vegetation structural properties,
   such as above-ground biomass (700-1300 nm), were identified as being the
   most important predictors of plant species diversity. We conclude that
   hyperspectral remote sensing technology is able to identify fine-scale
   variation in grassland diversity and has a potential use as a tool in
   surveys of grassland plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional management of montado (dehesa) is an example of integration
   of sustainable land-use and biodiversity conservation. The whole system
   sustainability is currently threatened by the intensification of soil
   tilling to control shrub invasion and promote pastureland, the absence
   of tree natural regeneration being one of the most outstanding threats.
   A study to assess effects of management on tree regeneration at early
   stages was developed in a cork oak montado grazed by cattle, in southern
   Portugal. We specifically compared the effects of harrowing every 3-4
   years with those of shrub clearing with a shredder every 5-7 years. We
   hypothesized that extending shrub maintenance may facilitate cork oak
   regeneration at early stages in grazed montado. Fenced cork oak paddocks
   under the same management system for at least the last 40 years were
   surveyed for cork oak seedling, juvenile and sapling density; shrub
   cover percentage was also estimated. Recruitment bottleneck was observed
   after the seedling stage under harrowing, while in shredded areas all
   stages were well represented and often associated with shrub patches.
   Overall, the highest cork oak recruitment occurred at intermediate shrub
   cover (40-60 \%). By maintaining shrub patches and their protective
   effect against direct radiation and grazing impact, while preventing
   shrub encroachment, shredding every 7 years seems to create an important
   temporal window for effective oak regeneration. This management practice
   might thus be suitable to favour successful tree regeneration in grazed
   cork oak montado, assuring the persistence of this system.}},

Abstract = {{Lichens are very sensitive to habitat changes and their species richness
   is likely to decline under intensive land use. Currently, a
   comprehensive study analyzing lichen species richness in relation to
   land-use types, extending over different regions and including
   information on habitat variables, is missing for temperate grasslands.
   In three German regions we studied lichen species richness in 490 plots
   of 16 m(2) representing different land-use types, livestock types, and
   habitat variables. Due to the absence of low-intensity pastures and
   substrates such as woody plants, deadwood and stones, there were no
   lichens in the 78 plots in Schorfheide-Chorin. In the two other regions,
   the richness of lichen species was 45 \% higher in pastures than in
   meadows, and 77 \% higher than in mown pastures, respectively. Among the
   pastures, the richness of all lichen species was on average 10 times
   higher in sheep-grazed pastures than in the ones grazed by cattle or
   horses. On average, the richness of all lichen species increased by 3.3
   species per additional microhabitat. Furthermore, the richness of
   corticolous lichens increased by 1.2 species with 10 \% higher cover of
   woody plants, lignicolous lichen species richness increased by 4.8
   species with 1 \% higher cover of deadwood, and saxicolous lichen
   species richness increased by 1.0 species with 1 \% higher cover of
   stones. Our findings highlight the importance of low-intensity land use
   for lichen conservation. In particular, the degradation of grasslands
   rich in microhabitats and the destruction of lichen substrates by
   intensification, and conversion of unfertilized pastures formerly grazed
   at low intensity to meadows should be avoided to maintain lichen
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Agro-pastoral decline in European mountain areas has recently caused
   changes to traditional landscapes with negative consequences on
   semi-natural grassland conservation and the associated biodiversity and
   ecosystem services. In the Italian Alps, grassland patches enclosed in a
   forest matrix are progressively disappearing. Two alpine valleys (Pesio
   and Pejo), having similar land-use history, were chosen as
   representative of management conditions of western and eastern Italian
   Alps, respectively. This study aims at interpreting the effect of
   abandonment on grassland patch plant diversity, considering land cover
   changes of the last 60 years, and assessing the role of ecological,
   topographic, management and landscape configuration on current grassland
   species richness. The total area of grassland patches has declined by 54
   and 91 \% at Pesio and at Pejo, respectively. Actual grassland patch
   species richness was mostly influenced by ecological factors, such as
   quantity of light, soil moisture and reaction, then by topographic
   features, especially slope, and finally by management intensity.
   Landscape factors exerted a slightly significant effect on plant
   diversity. In the two valleys, differences on management practices were
   detected. Even though in the western valley the conservation of several
   grazing activities contributed to slow down the process of patch
   reduction, many species-rich grasslands were generally under-grazed.
   Conversely, in the eastern valley, despite a denser road network, the
   stronger decline of grassland patch extension was linked to the hay
   making decline. At the same time, overuse of grassland patches near
   farms reduced plant species richness. As a conclusion, plant species
   richness was weakly related to the area of grassland patches and current
   and historical landscape configuration were of relatively lower
   importance than ecological, topographic and management factors, when
   evaluated at patch-level.}},

Abstract = {{The species-area relationship (SAR) is one of the most fundamental
   concepts in community ecology and is helpful for biodiversity
   conservation. However, few studies have systematically addressed this
   topic for different alpine grassland types on the Tibetan Plateau,
   China. We explored whether the plant composition of different functional
   groups affects the manner in which species richness increases with
   increasing area at scales a parts per thousand currency sign 1.0 m(2).
   We also compared species richness (S) within and across forbs, legumes,
   sedges and grasses, with sampling subplot area (A) increasing from
   0.0625 m(2) to 1.0 m(2) between alpine meadow and steppe communities. We
   applied a logarithmic function (S = b (0) + b (1) ln A) to determine the
   slope and intercept of SAR curves within and across functional groups.
   The results showed that the logarithmic relationship holds true between
   species richness and sampling area at these small scales. Both the
   intercept and slope of the logarithmic forbs-area curves are
   significantly higher than those for the three other functional groups (P
   < 0.05). Forb accounts for about 91.9 \% of the variation in the
   intercept and 75.0\% of the variation in the slope of the SAR curve when
   all functional groups' data were pooled together. Our results indicated
   that the different SAR patterns should be linked with species dispersal
   capabilities, environmental filtering, and life form composition within
   alpine grassland communities. Further studies on the relationship

Abstract = {{Mediterranean mountain landscapes have high ecological and cultural
   values. However, since 1950, a large number of these landscapes have
   been subject to degradation as a consequence of land abandonment. Some
   regional administrations have enacted measures that favour the
   regeneration of pasturelands through scrubland clearing. The aim of this
   study was to evaluate the consequences of clearing and the regeneration
   of pasturelands on landscape structure and the recovery of extensive
   livestock in La Rioja. The results indicate that between 1986 and 2011
   an area of 29,659ha was cleared in the mountains of La Rioja, although
   626\% of this was cleared in the period 2000-2011. In 1956, the
   landscape was dominated by cultivated fields, but by 2001, much of the
   agricultural area had been abandoned and replaced by scrubland, natural
   woods and reforested areas. Furthermore, the landscape was more
   fragmented in 1956 than in 2001. The landscape structure varied
   following clearing, with a doubling in the number of patches and an
   increase in heterogeneity. The consequences of clearing have included an
   increase in the area of pastureland and the number of large animals. In
   addition, the number of farms has decreased, but their mean size has
   increased. Clearing is an appropriate way for spatial reorganization in
   marginal mountain areas. It does not require excessive investment but
   favours the reintegration of abandoned fields and an increase in
   pasturelands. The results of this study contribute to the debate about
   reclaiming mountain landscapes affected by human activities and subject

Abstract = {{To halt the decline of biodiversity in European farmland, two major
   tools are available: the Natura 2000 network and agri-environment
   schemes (AES). We investigated the effect of these two measures on local
   species richness, single species occurrence and beta diversity of
   grassland birds in Poland. We counted birds on AES parcels (with less
   intensive grassland management) and control parcels, both within and
   outside Special Protection Areas (SPAS, part of Natura 2000), during
   2013-2014. Local species richness of AES-target birds was not associated
   with AES. Similarly, the turnover of AES-target species among sites was
   comparable at AES and control parcels. Furthermore, no positive
   interaction between AES and SPAs was observed, indicating a general lack
   of effect of AES. Local species richness of SPA-target birds was not
   higher within than outside SPAs, but two SPA-target species were more
   common and the beta diversity of SPA-target species was higher within
   than outside SPAS. Thus, our study showed no positive effects of AES on
   the occurrence of their target species, but confirmed some positive
   effects of SPAs on their target species. The decision to restrict AES to
   Special Protection Areas in 2015-2020 has no justification in our
   analyses. Actually, many AES-target species will be protected within
   SPAs irrespective of whether the area is an AES or not, but future AES
   should also include parcels outside SPAS, as many target species occur
   there. However, to improve the effectiveness of AES management
   prescriptions should be diversified and customized to meet the largely
   different habitat preferences of present target species (such as, for
   instance, the lapwing and corncrake). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights

Abstract = {{There are plant-based alternatives to cow's milk that resemble milk in
   appearance and function, but differ nutritionally. These are associated
   with lower land use and environmental impact than milk. However, there
   are places where dairy herds contribute positively to conservation of
   high nature value pastures through their grazing. The dairy system also
   produces meat, but it can be questioned how much beef is
   needed/demanded. This study evaluated the environmental impact of
   production of oat drink in comparison with production of milk in terms
   of: i) the necessity for sufficient grazing animals in the landscape for
   biodiversity conservation; ii) different perspectives on the need for
   beef and protein; iii) the opportunity cost of land; and iv) the
   differing protein content of milk and oat drink. The climate impact,
   eutrophication and acidification potential and ecotoxicity impacts of a
   typical Swedish dairy farm were calculated and compared with those of
   the same farm when milk production was replaced by production of oat
   drink and three different alternatives to dairy beef: 1) beef from
   suckler herds; 2) chicken; and 3) plant-based protein. In all scenarios,
   the same area of semi natural grassland was grazed. The opportunity cost
   of land use was included by producing bioenergy on spare land. The
   direct greenhouse gas emissions were considerably lower (16-41\%) for
   all oat drink scenarios than for the milk scenario. When the bioenergy
   produced on the spare land was assumed to replace diesel, this
   substitution effect together with the carbon sequestration in soils
   cancelled out the direct emissions almost entirely when chicken or
   plant-based protein was produced instead of beef. The eutrophication
   potential was similar for all scenarios, while the acidification
   potential was 21-37\% higher in the oat drink scenarios due to the need
   for handling increased amounts of digestate from bioenergy (biogas)
   production. This explorative study demonstrated great potential for
   reduced climate impact through production of oat drink instead of cow's
   milk, while still preserving grazing services for biodiversity
   conservation. However, for this to happen, incentives to manage
   semi-natural grassland need to be introduced, as such management is not
   an inherent effect of oat drink production. In addition, for the
   environmental benefits demonstrated in this study to come about,
   consumers must be incentivised to consume oat drink instead of milk and,
   to achieve the largest climate impact reductions, to replace some beef
   with chicken or cereals and legumes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{World population is growing, and with it, the demand for food. In order

   biodiversity, carbon sequestration, as well as water and nutrient
   cycling. Diverse biological communities are found in both natural and
   semi-natural grasslands; habitat destruction as a result of agricultural
   practices is a threat to biodiversity in these regions. While critics
   often blame modernized farming practices for agricultural pollution and
   habitat fragmentation, 21st century technology will likely be a means
   for updating farming practices to address both biodiversity conservation
   and enhanced efficiency for increased food demand. Recently developed
   portable electric fences, made of plastic netting and stainless steel,
   have made eco-agricultural practices, such as rotational grazing (RG)
   and multi-species pasture systems, easier and less expensive for farmers
   to put into practice than traditional electric fencing. Conflicting
   literature exists regarding whether or not RG systems outperform
   continuous grazing systems. Many studies suggest that more research is

Abstract = {{Pasture management intensity, livestock grazing and prescribed fire are
   three widespread agricultural practices that affect small, isolated
   wetlands, but few studies have investigated their individual and
   interactive effects. Pasture management intensity refers to the degree
   of human alteration of grassland, ranging from intensively managed
   pastures planted with introduced forage, fertilizer/lime additions and
   artificial drainage to semi-natural pastures with mixed native and
   non-native vegetation, no fertilizer/lime additions and little or no
   artificial drainage. We examined individual and interactive effects of
   these three agricultural practices on individual, isolated wetlands
   using a replicated, full-factorial experiment on 40 entire wetlands in
   south Florida, USA. Wetlands were embedded in two pasture management
   intensities: intensively managed and semi-natural. After three years of
   treatment initiation, vegetation of wetlands released from grazing and
   unburned embedded in semi-natural pastures had significantly lower
   evenness and coefficient of conservatism scores compared to wetlands
   released from grazing and burned, grazed unburned wetlands and grazed
   burned wetlands in the same pasture management intensity. For wetlands
   embedded in intensively managed pastures, evenness and coefficient of
   conservatism scores did not differ among treatments. Release from
   grazing increased abundance of the native, weedy herb, Eupatorium
   capillifolium. Grazing interacted with prescribed fire to affect shrub
   abundance and non-native richness; relative abundance of shrubs and
   non-native richness were greater in wetlands released from grazing and
   burned and did not differ among burn treatments in grazed wetlands.
   Interactive effects, especially three-way interactions, were uncommon
   and not as important as differences between the two pasture management
   intensities.Synthesis and applications. Vegetation diversity and
   floristic quality of wetlands embedded in intensively managed pastures
   resisted common restoration management techniques such as release from
   grazing and prescribed fire, at least in the short term. In contrast,
   removing all top-down disturbances from wetlands embedded in
   semi-natural grasslands can negatively affect vegetation species
   diversity and floristic quality. Future studies should examine how
   intensity and seasonality of grazing and prescribed fire affect wetland
   vegetation, and track long-term responses to evaluate lag effects.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial heterogeneity of limiting soil resources is an essential
   factor determining ecosystem processes and function. It has been
   reported that large herbivores can strongly impact the variation and
   spatial distribution pattern of soil nitrogen (N). However, it remains
   unclear how large herbivores affect soil spatial heterogeneity and
   whether this influence is dependent on plant community diversity. Here
   we examined effects of different herbivore assemblages {[}no grazing;
   cattle grazing (CG); sheep grazing (SG); and mixed grazing (MG) of
   cattle and sheep] on soil N spatial heterogeneity in grasslands with
   high and low pre-grazing plant diversity in an eastern Eurasian steppe.
   We found that herbivore grazing generated and maintained spatial
   patterns of soil nutrients, depending on herbivore assemblage and the
   level of pre-grazing plant diversity. CG increased the spatial
   heterogeneity of soil available N in Leymus chinensis-dominated steppe
   meadows, which were independent of pre-grazing plant diversity. However,
   the effects of SG and MG strongly depended on grassland plant diversity,
   with an increased spatial heterogeneity of soil available N in the
   high-diversity grassland, but not in the low-diversity
   grassland.Synthesis and applications. We concluded that in a
   L.chinensis-dominated eastern Eurasian steppe, cattle ranching could be
   considered as an optimal grazing management protocol to improve soil
   spatial heterogeneity because cattle grazing (CG) consistently increased
   soil spatial heterogeneity in the context of both low and high plant
   diversity. Nevertheless, soil spatial heterogeneity could be improved by
   any herbivore grazing regime {[}CG and/or sheep grazing (SG)] when high
   plant diversity is maintained. These findings highlight the importance
   of conserving plant diversity to maintain grassland structure and
   ecosystem function. In grassland systems with high plant diversity,
   herbivore grazing and plant diversity would jointly improve soil spatial
   heterogeneity, thus feeding back to maintain higher plant diversity.
   Therefore, high plant diversity could generate a positive feedback loop
   of herbivore-plant-soil interactions in grazed grassland systems. Our
   findings indicate the importance of herbivore assemblages in maintaining
   spatial heterogeneity in low- and high-diversity grassland systems.}},

Abstract = {{One of the main challenges of studying grazing ecology is to predict
   food intake of herbivores. Plant species diversity may have important
   consequences for regulation of food intake by generalist herbivores. To
   reveal the regulation processes underlying food intake affected by plant
   species richness, we investigated sheep foraging during a 2-h foraging
   period (subdivided into four 30-min intervals) in response to altered
   plant species richness (2, 4, 6, and 8 species) using an indoor
   cafeteria trial. Our results showed that high plant diversity
   significantly improved a sheep's intake during each of the lime
   intervals, and the extent of improvement for intake gradually
   strengthened as foraging proceeded. Furthermore, we found that dynamics
   of food intake was modified as plant species richness increased. At
   lower plant diversity, intake of sheep was highest at the beginning and
   then decreased continuously as satiation proceeded. But this decreasing
   trend gradually slowed as the available plant diversity increased, and
   sheep even maintained high and constant intake during all intervals for
   the 6 and 8 species level. Fasting is generally thought to be an
   important endogenous factor affecting herbivore foraging motivation, and
   effects of fasting decreased as satiation proceeded. Our study indicated
   that diet diversity could be an important exogenous factor, and the
   diversity effects significantly increased with time. The complementary
   effects of endogenous and exogenous factors resulted in high herbivore
   intake during the entire 2-h grazing bouts under conditions of high
   plant diversity. We concluded that diet diversity can greatly increase
   foraging motivation of sheep, and improving foraging motivation,
   especially at the later phase of the meal, seems to be a key factor for
   stimulating food intake by the herbivore. Our study also indicates that
   conserving grassland plant diversity is critically beneficial not only
   to plant productivity, but also to animal productivity.}},

Title = {{Environmental heterogeneity has a weak effect on diversity during

Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Understanding what constrains the persistence of species in communities
   is at the heart of community assembly theory and its application to
   conserving and enhancing biodiversity. The ``environmental heterogeneity
   hypothesis{''} predicts greater species coexistence in habitats with
   greater resource variability. In the context of community assembly,
   environmental heterogeneity may influence the variety and strength of
   abiotic conditions and competitive interactions (environmental filters)
   to affect the relative abundance of species and biodiversity. We
   manipulated key resources that influence plant diversity in tallgrass
   prairie (i.e., soil depth and nitrogen availability) to increase
   environmental heterogeneity prior to sowing native prairie species into
   a former agricultural field. We compared variability in nutrient
   availability, aboveground annual net primary productivity (ANPP), and
   the composition of species between replicate plots containing soil
   heterogeneity manipulations and plots with no resource manipulations (n
   = 4 per treatment) during the first 15 yr of community assembly as a
   test of the ``environmental heterogeneity hypothesis.{''} The
   manipulations increased environmental heterogeneity, measured as the
   coefficient of variation in NO3-N availability and ANPP. Plant
   diversity, however, was similar and decayed exponentially and
   indiscriminately over time between the heterogeneity treatments. Species
   richness declined linearly over time in both heterogeneity treatments,
   but richness was higher in the more heterogeneous soil 2 yr following a
   second propagule addition 8 yr after the initial sowing. As a result,
   there was a lower rate of species loss over time in the more
   heterogeneous soil (0.60 species yr(-1)) relative to the control soil
   (0.96 species yr(-1)). Communities in each treatment exhibited strong
   convergence over time resulting from a shift in dominant species across
   all treatments and a gradual increase in the clonal C-4 grass,
   Andropogon gerardii. We attribute the weak effect of heterogeneity on
   diversity to increasing dominance of a clonal species, which decreased
   the scale of soil treatments relative to plant size, dispersal
   limitation, and absence of a key driver (grazing) known to increase
   plant diversity under a frequent fire regime. Thus, steering community
   assembly to attain high biodiversity may depend more on manipulating
   processes that reduce dominance and facilitate the arrival of new
   species than promoting environmental heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use change is one of the most important anthropogenic environmental
   change drivers affecting the biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems.
   However, there is limited knowledge of the consequences for soil
   processes in many regions around the globe. The Brazilian semi-arid
   ecosystem known as Caatinga has experienced the transformation from
   native forest into agricultural land, with heretofore unknown effects on
   soil processes and microbial properties. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the impact of five land-use changes (to maize and cowpea
   cropland, grape orchard, and cut and grazed pasture) on total organic C
   (TOC) and total N (TN) stocks and soil microbial properties of Ultisol
   from Caatinga. Soil samples (0-10 and 10-20cm depth) were collected
   during the wet and dry periods. Split-split plot analysis of variance
   was used to test the effects of land use, soil depth, season and the
   interaction between land-use and soil depth on soil microbial
   properties, TOC and TN stocks. Land-use effects were more pronounced in
   the top soil layer than in the lower layer, while the pattern was less
   consistent in soil microbial properties. Land conversion from native
   forest to cropland may cause C losses from the soil, but conversion to
   pastures may even increase the potential of soils to function as C
   sinks. Grazed pastures showed not only high C and N stocks but also the
   highest soil microbial biomass and lowest respiratory quotients, all
   indications for elevated soil C sequestration. Thus, grazed pastures may
   represent a land-use form with high ecosystem multifunctionality in
   Caatinga. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Mulching is a type of grassland management in which clippings are
   crushed into short lengths and left to decompose on the sward surface.
   This low-cost method has been widely used in the Czech Republic since
   1990 to maintain grassland without agricultural utilization. Several
   studies have examined the effects of mulching on vegetation, but none
   have focused on nutrients in the soil and herbage. We hypothesized that
   mulching supports nutrient turnover because of easy decomposition of the
   mulched biomass. We analysed data from a manipulative experiment in an
   upland grassland established in 2000 with the following treatments:
   unmanaged control (U);. two cuts per year with biomass removal in June
   and August (2C); mulching once per year in July (1M); mulching twice per
   year in June and August (2M); and mulching three times per year in May,
   July and September (3M). Based on RDA analysis, there were three groups
   of treatments with a similar response of soil and herbage chemical
   properties: (i) U; (ii) 2C (iii) 1M, 2M, 3M. After eleven years of the
   experiment the mulching regimes had not produced any substantial changes
   in soil and herbage nutrient concentrations in comparison with the
   unmanaged or/and cut treatments. However, under all mulching treatments
   there was a tendency for extractable soil P and K concentrations
   together with P and K concentrations in the herbage to be higher than
   under treatment 2C and lower than under treatment U. Herbage biomass
   production in the 2M treatment was significantly higher than in the 2C
   treatment. Plant species richness was significantly affected by applied
   treatment (2C > 3M, 2M> 1M, U). Mulching performed two or three times
   per year can substitute for a conventional cutting regime over eleven
   years without substantial changes in the Soil nutrient properties
   although a decrease in plant species diversity was observed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{For the temperate vegetation community, herbaceous biomass and species
   richness relationship has been eminent as a humpback response
   hypothesis. This appraised higher level of herbaceous richness at an
   intermediate level of biomass. However, no such study has been made in
   the sultry parched ecosystem. Hence, in the present study this kinship
   have been explored in the Indian hot, arid desert using three distinct
   seasonal events. Different community and soil parameters were quantified
   during different pulse events by following the touchstone methods. Based
   on dominant herbs, selected grazing lands were categorized under
   sub-climax stage, where 30, 24 and 18 species were recorded during pulse
   (rain), inter-pulse (winter) and non-pulse (summer) events,

Abstract = {{Large-scale, low-density grazing is a standard management concept for
   conserving or enhancing biodiversity in cultural landscapes of central
   Europe. Documentation of results concerning effects of this type of
   grazing on biodiversity and functioning of degraded river valleys,
   however, is rare. For a period of ten years, we investigated vegetation
   development of three pastures in a river valley of northern Germany,
   where rewetting was combined with large-scale cattle grazing for
   restoration of the valley's biodiversity as well as its water and
   nutrient regulation. The study yielded ambiguous results concerning
   achievement of restoration goals. Changes in plant diversity were
   dependent on site conditions and on previous land-use of the associated
   pastures. On mineral soils, species richness, total species number and
   beta-diversity increased. On fen soils that formerly were species-poor
   wet grasslands, an increase in species richness was observed, whereas at
   sites formerly of species-rich vegetation, species richness decreased.
   Development of 13-diversity showed no clear trend on fen sites.
   Establishment of woody species as indicator for enhanced structural
   heterogeneity was successful on mineral soils of abandoned arable fields
   with an open sward, and also on fen soils close to mature nursery trees.
   We conclude that a fine-tuning of factors influencing grazing behaviour
   of cattle is necessary for achieving simultaneous targets of nature
   conservation and resource protection. Restoration of river valleys in
   cultural landscapes is however a lengthy process, thus, long-term
   monitoring is indispensable for avoiding mismanagement. (C) 2015

   Therewere no synergistic effects of grazing and N treatment. Although NP

   the critical load, excess N is likely to be stored in moss biomass and

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Abstract = {{The type and intensity of plant-herbivore interactions are likely to be
   altered under climate change as a consequence of differential dispersal
   rates of plants and their herbivores. Here, we studied variation in
   herbivore damage on Salvia nubicola in the field and compared its growth
   and defence strategies against herbivores in controlled conditions using
   seeds from populations along a broad altitudinal gradient. Our work is
   one of the first studies to simultaneously measure complex intraspecific
   variation in plant growth, direct and indirect defences as well as plant
   tolerance (ability to regrow) as a consequence of herbivore attack
   simulated by clipping. In the field, we found that plants experienced
   higher herbivore pressure in lower altitudes. In the greenhouse, plants
   grown from seeds collected in lower-altitude populations grew better and
   produced a higher content of phenolic compounds (direct defence) and
   volatile organic compounds (indirect defence) in response to simulated
   herbivory. However, there were no differences in tolerance and effect of
   S. nubicola extracts on the model generalist herbivore Spodoptera
   littoralis (direct defence) along the altitudinal gradient. Although we
   found that S. nubicola developed a range of defence strategies, the
   strategies do not seem to be used simultaneously in all populations even
   though most of them are correlated with altitudinal gradient. Our
   finding is in agreement with the current knowledge that co-expression of
   multiple defences might be costly for a plant, since investment in
   defensive traits is assumed to reduce the resource availability for
   growth and reproduction. Our study thus shows the importance of
   simultaneous study of different defence strategies since understanding
   these trade-offs could be necessary for detecting the mechanisms by
   which plants are able to cope with future climate change.}},

   of the KwaZulu-Natal Sandstone Sourveld grassland, South Africa}},
Journal = {{BOTHALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Abstract = {{Background: South Africa is characterised by high levels of biodiversity
   and species endemism alongside critical levels of socio-economic
   vulnerability, demonstrating potential for conservation practices that
   provide both environmental and social benefits. It is argued that
   communitybased conservation (CBC) practices can be strategically
   positioned to achieve environmental conservation objectives as well as
   promote local-level socio-economic development. The KwaZulu-Natal
   Sandstone Sourveld (KZNSS) vegetation type is classified as endemic (to
   KZN, South Africa), and is at present listed as endangered.
   Additionally, one of the KZNSS grassland patches occurs adjacent to the
   low-income peri-urban community of iNanda. The study examined local
   community uses and perceptions of the vegetation type.
   Objectives: To examine the uses, perceptions and attitudes displayed by
   the iNanda community towards the KZNSS grassland patch. Furthermore, it
   is hoped that the results of this study can be utilised to inform the
   potential use of CBC strategies within socio-economic contexts such as
   iNanda.
   Method: A mixed methodological approach was adopted, focusing on iNanda
   as the case study. One hundred households were purposively interviewed.
   Descriptive and chi-square statistical tests were carried out to examine
   main data trends.
   Results: Respondents displayed alarming levels of unemployment (61\%)
   and 34\% relied on state grants as a source of household income.
   Households used the grassland for subsistence (51\%), grazing (14\%),
   recreational (13\%) and cultural purposes (12\%). Respondents displayed
   limited awareness of conservation and the ecological importance of the
   grassland. However, respondents recognised the need to conserve the
   grassland based on their perception of changes to the adjacent patch.
   Conclusion: Potential grassland conservation plans should consider the
   current use displayed by respondents. Participatory approaches to
   conservation such as CBC initiatives could provide much-needed
   socio-economic and conservation benefits.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between plant diversity and productivity has been hotly
   debated over the last two decades. What makes the relationship complex
   is, in part, the interplay of several biotic and abiotic effects, which
   include rainfall variability, soil characteristics and grazing. We
   investigated the influence of grazing intensity on the
   diversity-productivity relationship in a wide range of soil pH along a
   rainfall gradient in semi-arid grassland. Vegetation and soil surveys
   were conducted in high grazing (HG) and low grazing (LG) grasslands
   around Bethlehem (716 mm mean annual rainfall, moderately acidic soil),
   Bloemfontein (543 mm, slightly acidic/neutral soil) and Kimberley (467
   mm, neutral/slightly alkaline soil) in South Africa. Plant species
   occurring in the study area were recorded, and aboveground biomass was
   estimated by clippings. Soils sampled were analysed for chemical
   properties. Species richness increased with increasing biomass and
   decreasing pH in Kimberley and Bloemfontein and subsequently declined
   with increasing biomass and decreasing pH in Bethlehem. The relationship
   between species richness and biomass was hump-shaped across the study
   area but when we differentiated between the degrees of grazing, we found
   linear positive relationships at both LG and HG sites. This suggests
   that the diversity-productivity relationship needs to be carefully
   examined in grazing land.}},

   showed that moderately grazed plant communities were significantly
   different from low and high grazing sites. In summary, grazing intensity

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of grazing,
   precipitation and temperature factors on plant species dynamics
   (diversity and composition) in the semi-steppe of Isfahan semi-arid
   rangelands, Iran. The effects of Sheep grazing were studied in a
   controlled experiment along grazing gradient with seven intensities
   (from very heavily grazed to nongrazed) during six consecutive years
   (2006-2011). The results show that plant species dynamics varied among
   years, but were only slightly affected by grazing intensity. Since the
   experimental years were much dryer than the long term average, the
   abiotic constraints may have overridden any grazing effect. The
   differences among the years were predominantly determined by the abiotic
   factors of temperature and precipitation. Most of the variations in
   species dynamics and coexistence between the C-4 and C-3 species were
   explained by seasonal weather conditions, i.e., temperature and
   precipitation regimes during the early season (March-June). The dominant
   C-3 species, Poa bulbosa, was highly competitive in March-June at low
   and high temperature and rainfall levels, respectively. In contrast, the
   most common C-4 species Cynodon dactylon benefited from high and low
   early season temperature and rainfall levels, respectively. However,
   biomass of P. bulbosa was positively correlated with temperature in
   March, when effective mean temperature ranges from 0 to 5 degrees C and
   thus promotes vernalization and vegetative sprouting. Our results
   suggest that, over a six-year period, it is temporal variability in
   temperature and precipitation rather than grazing that determines
   vegetation dynamics and species distributions in grazed semi-steppe
   ecosystems. Our results also support that the variability in the
   dominant species biomass, rather than diversity, determine ecosystem
   functioning. This study provides fundamental knowledge on the complex
   interaction of climate, vegetation, and grazing.}},

   for sampling}},
Journal = {{NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{41-62}},
Abstract = {{Butterfly monitoring schemes are recording programs initiated to monitor
   nationwide butterfly abundance and distribution patterns, often with
   help from volunteers. The method generates high-resolution data, but may
   be associated with a degree of habitat sampling bias if volunteers
   prefer to survey areas perceived to be high-quality butterfly habitats.
   This can result in habitats becoming underrepresented in the data set,
   leading to less information about the butterfly populations there. In
   the present study, we investigate the possibility of applying a spatial
   design used by the Swedish Bird Survey for nationwide, grid-based
   sampling, with a goal to get butterfly monitoring data covering a
   representative sample of different habitats. We surveyed four 2x2 km
   sampling squares, split into 100 m segments, in the southernmost region
   of Sweden (Scania) and four in the northernmost region (Norrbotten). The
   grid-based transects were compared with volunteer-selected transects in
   a GIS analysis using a refined Swedish version of CORINE land cover data
   to see how well these two transect designs represent true habitat
   coverage. A total of 53 km transect was monitored, resulting in 490
   individuals and 29 different species recorded. We found that transect
   cover correlated significantly with overall land cover using both
   monitoring methods, though standardised transects outperformed
   volunteer-selected transects in habitat representation in Scania, but
   not in Norrbotten. Butterflies were found to aggregate significantly in
   specific habitats, but with contrasting results for the two
   geographically different regions. Grasslands in both regions generated a
   high number of recorded butterflies, although so did clear-cut and
   residential areas in Norrbotten as well. The highest number of
   individuals recorded per transect was found in bogs in Scania. This
   study emphasises the value of complementing free site selection
   monitoring schemes with spatially representative schemes such as the
   Swedish Bird Survey, and sheds some light on general habitat preferences
   for Swedish butterflies in two contrasting climatic regions.}},

Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Abstract = {{The primitive landscape predominant in the Chaco region of Argentina,
   Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil, was a patchwork of forests alternating
   with grasslands and savannas. Regionally, over-grazing produced the
   replacement of herbaceous communities of grasslands and savannas for

   study was to evaluate variation in diversity and composition of birds in
   a gradient of three types of habitats of Semi-arid Chaco: (i) Quebrachos
   Forest (Aspidosperma quebracho-blanco, Schinopsis lorentzii); (ii) Low
   shrubland, which constitutes a degraded version of the; (iii) Aibe
   Savanna (Elionurus muticus). The results suggest that the diversity of
   birds was determined by the vertical complexity of the vegetation and
   the degree of similarity of bird assemblages by the degree of similarity
   between habitat types. This led to: (i) gradual decreases in diversity
   of birds from the more complex (Forest) to the less complex habitat
   (Savanna); (ii) a unique composition of species in the Forest and the
   Savanna (more dissimilar habitats), where birds of closed habitats
   prevail in the first and open habitat species in the second and; (iii)
   Low shrubland, displaying greater similarity to the Forest than to the
   Savanna, representing a habitat unsuitable for open habitat birds. In
   forested areas the management should strive to maintain or improve the
   vegetal structure. In shrublands, grasslands and savannas prescribed

Title = {{Grazing effects on plant diversity in the endemic Erica mackayana
   heathland community of north-west Spain}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY \& DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{207-217}},
Abstract = {{Background: Large areas of heathland landscapes in Galicia, north-west
   Spain, have traditionally been extensively grazed by free-ranging cattle
   and wild ponies. Recently, a large reduction in the number of these
   larger herbivores has been observed, with unknown consequences for the
   habitat.
   Aims: To evaluate the effects of grazing and herbivore density on plant
   diversity, community composition and vegetation structure of the endemic
   wet heathlands dominated by Erica mackayana in Galicia.
   Methods: Field sampling of vascular plants, generalised linear models
   (GLMs), non-metric multidimensional distance scaling (NMDS).
   Results: Grazed sites had significantly higher total and rare species
   richness and diversity than ungrazed sites. Higher densities of cattle
   resulted in lower numbers of rare species, while wild pony density had
   no effect on rare species richness. In grazed sites, vegetation was
   lower with greater variation in height, resulting in greater
   heterogeneity of the habitat. Precipitation and summer temperatures were
   related to plant diversity, mainly beta diversity. Soil organic matter
   negatively correlated with rare species.
   Discussion: Grazing, mostly by wild ponies, was demonstrated to be
   positively related to plant diversity and vegetation structure. Lack of
   grazing or high cattle densities resulted in a negative effect on total
   and rare species richness and diversity. Future climate change may
   negatively affect heathland plant diversity. Galician wild ponies
   represent a unique case of sustainable management of a wild species and
   an invaluable cultural heritage. Moreover, they have a significant role
   in maintaining the endemic E. mackayana heathlands, what would justify
   specific conservation actions for these large herbivores.}},

   butterflies on organic suckler cow farms}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{36}},
Pages = {{97-119}},
Abstract = {{The intensification of agricultural practices has led to a severe
   decrease in grassland biodiversity. Although there is strong evidence
   that organic farming can reduce the negative impacts of land use,
   knowledge regarding the most beneficial management system for species
   richness on organic grasslands is still scarce. This study examines
   differences in the biodiversity of plants and butterflies on
   rotationally and continuously grazed pastures as well as on meadows cut
   twice per year on two large organic suckler cow farms in NE Germany.
   Vegetation and flower abundance, as factors likely to influence
   butterfly abundance and diversity, were compared and used to explain the
   differences. The data attained by vegetation assessments and monthly
   transect inspections from May to August were analyzed using descriptive
   statistics and nonparametric methods. The abiotic site conditions of the
   studied plots had more influence on plant species numbers than the
   management method. Dry and nutrient-poor areas (mainly poor types of
   Cynosurion) and undrained wet fens (Calthion) were important for
   phytodiversity, measured by the absolute number of species, indicator
   species for ecologically valuable grasslands and the Shannon Index.
   Meadows tended to have more indicator species than pastures, where
   small-scale special sites such as wet depressions were crucial for plant
   diversity. Butterfly diversity was very low, and 90\% of the recorded
   butterflies were individuals of the generalist species Pieris napi.
   Butterfly abundance depended mainly on occurrence of specific habitat
   types and specific larval host plants. Supply of flowers was crucial
   only in certain time periods. Differences in butterfly abundance between
   the management systems could be explained by the site conditions of the
   studied grasslands. We conclude that meadows are more favorable to
   support ecologically valuable plant species; however, their extension is
   contradictory to the organic farming method of suckler cows maintained
   outside of stables. Rotationally grazed pastures could be a compromise
   that would enhance the temporal heterogeneity of flower abundance and
   vegetation structure. The plant diversity on pastures should be improved
   by less intensive grazing on special sites and plant species enrichment
   by means of hay transfer. For enhancing butterfly diversity we suggest
   to reduce land use intensity especially on poor soils. Considering the
   economic perspective of the farms, small parts of the agricultural area
   could be sufficient if connectivity to other suitable habitats is
   assured. Flower abundance and diversity of larval host plants could be
   promoted by high diversity of farming practices as well as preserving
   small uncut strips of meadows.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-dry grasslands were once widely distributed communities, but today
   they represent some of the most vulnerable habitats in Central Europe.
   European and national legislation and non-governmental organizations
   have managed to protect some of the remaining fragments. However,
   despite their status as Natura 2000 habitats, they are often endangered
   due to improper management, fragmentation and edge effects from adjacent
   croplands. By using a sample of 44 semi-dry hay meadows in the
   south-eastern Alpine Foreland of Styria, we investigated how
   species-richness and trait composition of semi-dry grassland species
   respond to variation in patch size, connectivity, abiotic site factors
   and management regimes. We used linear regression models to identify the
   most important drivers for richness of typical semi-dry grassland
   species and thus conservation value. The number of typical semi-dry
   grassland species was highest in well-connected fragments, i.e. units
   that shared two or more borders with neighbouring species-rich
   grasslands. Furthermore, large semi-dry grasslands (> 8000 m(2)) had
   highest numbers of semi-dry grassland species and highest relevance for
   conservation; no difference was found among smaller fragment sizes.
   Unregular management was associated with increased presence of
   competitive species which replaced stress-tolerant specialists. Our
   study indicates that under eutrophication, small fragment size and
   isolation, only large semi-dry grasslands can sustain a high number of
   species with high conservation value. The conservation value of smaller
   semi-dry grassland fragments could be improved by buffer zones, adapted
   mowing treatments and periodical sheep grazing.}},

   enhancing grassland biodiversity}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{36}},
Pages = {{359-378}},
Abstract = {{Halting the loss of grassland biodiversity and restoring degraded
   ecosystems are high priority tasks in the EU Biodiversity Strategy.
   Sowing low-diversity seed mixtures is widely used in grassland
   restoration because of its high predictability and fast, promising
   results. Generally, the sown perennial grasses establish within a few
   years and form a dense sward, which effectively suppresses weeds.
   Unfortunately, these grasslands are often species-poor because the sown
   grasses hamper the colonisation of target grassland forbs. Our aim was
   to test a novel approach to increase the diversity of species-poor
   grasslands. We selected eight 8-year-old grasslands restored by
   low-diversity seed sowing where we created 32 establishment gaps by
   breaking up the grass sward and sowing a high-diversity seed mixture (35
   native species). Altogether, we established three grazed gaps (1 to x 1
   m, 2 m x 2 m and 4 m x 4 m) and one fenced gap (4 m x 4 m) per site and
   monitored the presence and abundance of sown and non sown species within
   a time frame of two years. We asked the following questions: (1) Which
   target species establish most successfully? (2) What is the effect of
   establishment gap size on the establishment success of target species
   and weeds? (3) What is the effect of management (grazed versus not
   managed) on the species composition of the establishment gaps? Our
   results showed that by creating establishment gaps and sowing diverse
   seed mixtures, we were able to overcome microsite and propagule
   limitation, successfully introducing target species into the
   species-poor grasslands. We found that all sown species established in
   the gaps, and the majority of the species maintained or even increased
   their first-year cover in the second year. Smaller gaps were
   characterised by lower cover of sown species and a quite stochastic
   development compared to the larger ones. Weed cover was moderate in the
   first year and decreased significantly in the second year, regardless of
   gap size. Therefore, in restoration practice, the use of larger
   establishment gaps is recommended. We found that the cover of sown
   species and weeds were similar in the grazed and unmanaged gaps during
   our study. However, management by extensive grazing might be crucial in
   the long-term because livestock can disperse target species propagules
   and create microsites. Our study shows that establishment gaps can serve
   as biodiversity hotspots. Further studies need to clarify to what extent
   they can improve the restoration success across the entire grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Plantations with fast growing exotic tree species can negatively affect
   native plant species diversity and promote the spread of alien species.
   Mediterranean Chile experienced major landscape changes with a vast
   expansion of industrial plantations of Pinus radiata in the past.
   However, with increasing knowledge of biodiversity effects on ecosystem
   services Chilean forest owners now aim to integrate the conservation of
   native biodiversity into forest management, but data on native species
   diversity and establishment within a plantation landscape is scarce.
   Here we investigated plant species diversity and composition in four
   forest management options applied within a landscape dominated by P.
   radiata plantations in comparison to an unmanaged reference: (i) a clear
   cut, (ii) a strip cut, (iii) a native canopy of Nothofagus glauca and
   (iv) a young P. radiata plantation. We wanted to assess if native plant
   species can be maintained either by natural regeneration or by planting
   of native tree species (Nothofagus glauca, N. obliqua, Quillaja
   saponaria) within this landscape.
   Results show a high diversity of native and forest plant species within
   the different management options indicating a high potential for native
   biodiversity restoration within an anthropogenic landscape. In
   particular, herbaceous species can benefit from management. They are
   rare in unmanaged natural forests that are characterized by low light
   conditions and a thick litter layer. Management, however, also promoted
   a diversity of alien species. The rapid spread of alien grass species
   after management can deter an initial establishment of native tree
   species or the survival and growth after planting mainly under dry but
   less under sufficient moisture conditions. The most unsuccessful option
   for promoting native plant species was clear cutting in a dry area where
   alien grasses were abundant. For drought-tolerant tree species such as
   Quillaja saponaria, though, even a joint establishment with Pinus
   radiata seems possible.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the biology and ecology of the myrmecophagic

   of the few with dry subtropical forests in the World. The aim of this
   work is to study the demography of this species, considering its
   seasonal variation in native environments, and if the livestock grazing
   and the agriculture, two of the most common anthropogenic activities of
   the Chaco Seco ecoregion, produce changes in their populations in the
   province of Salta (Argentina). We consider three type of environments:
   native (NA); affected by cattle and goats (NP); and affected by
   agriculture (NC). The latter corresponds to patches of native vegetation
   in an agricultural matrix. Three sampling sites were selected on each
   type of environment, where seasonal samplings using pitfall traps were
   performed during autumn, winter and spring (2006) and summer (2007). We
   collected 549 spiders of L. birabeni, with the juveniles reaching until
   the 64.12\% of total abundance, followed by males (26.41\%) and females

   individuals, reaching 44.99\% of the total abundance, while autumn
   reported the lowest percentage (7.83\%). The juveniles increase observed
   during the winter would indicate an adaptation to environmental
   conditions. The same pattern was observed in NA and NC environments, but
   not in NP ones. The later environments showed a decrease in the adult
   abundances across the seasons, while the NC populations showed an
   increase of male abundances during spring season with a sharp reduction
   of females and juveniles throughout the year. The abundance of L.
   birabeni in NA environments was higher (41.06\% of total abundance) and
   the least value was reported in NC environments (24.67\%). The two most
   common anthropogenic activities affecting the Chaco Seco of the province
   of Salta modify both the seasonal changes as the representation of the
   different developmental stages and sexes of the native populations of L.
   birabeni, being the most damaging factor the modification of the native
   environments by the agriculture.}},

Title = {{Agricultural weeds and coastal saltmarsh in south-eastern Australia: an
   insurmountable problem?}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{64}},

Pages = {{308-324}},
Abstract = {{It is often assumed that saline coastal wetlands experience
   environmental conditions so severe that they are largely immune to
   invasion by exotic plant species. The belief is implicit in many older
   reviews of threats to mangroves and coastal saltmarshes, where a limited
   range of vascular plant taxa, often focussing on {*}Spartina,
   (throughout the paper an asterisk denotes an introduced (exotic) species
   as per Carr 2012) have been invoked as the major species of concern.
   Even though the weed flora of southern Australia is derived largely from
   agriculture and horticulture, neither of which includes many species
   tolerant of waterlogged, variably saline environments, a recent
   assessment of Victorian saline coastal wetlands indicated that exotic
   plants were the third-most pervasive threat, after land `reclamation'
   and grazing. Tall wheat grass, {*}Lophopyrum ponticum (Podp.) A. Love.,
   is one of the most severe and widely distributed weeds of saline coastal
   wetlands in south-eastern Australia. It is promoted by the agricultural
   extension arm of the Victorian government as a salt-tolerant pasture
   grass; however, its broad ecological amplitude and robust life form make
   it a most serious invader of upper saltmarsh in Victoria. We assessed
   the effectiveness of different control measures, including slashing and
   herbicides, for the management of {*}L. ponticum infestations (and their
   side effects on saltmarsh communities) in the Western Port region of
   Victoria. A nominally monocot-specific herbicide widely used to control
   {*}Spartina, Fluazifop-P, was ineffective in controlling {*}L. ponticum.
   The broad-spectrum systemic herbicide glyphosate was more effective in
   controlling {*}L. ponticum, but had undesirable impacts on native plant
   species. Controlling weeds in coastal wetlands using available
   herbicides for use near coastal waterways would seem to remain
   problematic.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of grazing cessation management has only rarely been

Abstract = {{Large mammalian herbivores are keystone species affecting the
   biodiversity and functioning of ecosystems, since herbivory directly
   influences plant species competitive ability. Thus, when managing
   habitats for conservation it is crucial to understand the selection
   patterns of large herbivores and their effect on plant diversity and

   central-eastern Alps, comparing late mowing with grazing by red deer.
   We found that, with high stocking rates, red deer significantly affects
   the species and functional composition of alpine productive pastures,
   mostly by competitive exclusion of subordinate species due to the spread
   of poorly palatable, competitive, stress-tolerant tall grasses with
   strong avoidance strategies. We argued that grazing by red deer with
   high stocking rates is harmful when acts on formerly managed meadows,
   while it has a positive impact on plant diversity of long-term abandoned
   grasslands. Our results indicated that grazing by red deer with high
   stoking rates hinders the spread of successional/ruderal species, but
   allows the establishment of competitive dominant tall grasses. Our
   findings also confirmed the hypothesis that the impact of red deer on
   grassland biodiversity follows the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.}},

Journal = {{SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-65}},
Abstract = {{Large areas of grassland in the agro-pastoral region of northern China
   were converted into cropland for grain production, and the remaining
   grasslands are being overgrazed and seriously degraded. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate how reductions in grazing intensity affect
   the soil and vegetation characteristics in grasslands of northern China.
   Soil heterogeneity and vegetation characteristics were evaluated for
   ungrazed (UG), moderate grazing (MG), and heavy grazing (HG) sites.
   Grazing increased diversity, but heavy grazing decreased aboveground
   biomass and increased the non-grass component. The non-grass proportion
   of total biomass increased with grazing intensity, which was 8, 16 and
   48\% for UG, MG and HG sites, respectively. Species richness at the MG
   and HG sites was significantly higher than at the UG site (P < 0.05)
   with 3.6, 5.5 and 5.7 for UG, MGand HG sites, respectively. Strong
   spatial dependence of the examined soil properties at 10 m scale for all
   grazed sites was revealed by the ratio of nugget to total variation
   (0-23 \%). Overgrazing homogenized soil characteristics at a 10 m scale.
   The ranges of spatial autocorrelation for soil organic C (SOC) and total
   N were both > 120 m at the HG site, which was considerably larger than
   that at the MG and UG sites with corresponding distances of 17.3 and
   20.8 m for the MG site and 8.6 and 15.0 m for the UG site, respectively.
   The sampling density and sampling space for the HG site could be
   decreased under this scale sampling interval (10 m). Therefore, MG was
   recommended as the preferred management alternative for grasslands in
   northern China because of increased plant diversity without negative
   consequences related to decreased forage quality, forage quantity and
   soil heterogeneity for the investigated soil properties in northern
   China's grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Due to ongoing conversion of the dry forests of southern Ecuador to
   pasture and farmland, they are among the most threatened ecosystems
   globally. This study explored how to control deforestation in the region
   while securing the livelihoods of local people through land-use
   diversification and compensation payments. Results are based on
   interview data collected from 163 households near the Laipuna Reserve in
   southern Ecuador. Combining modern financial theory and von Thunen's
   theory of land distribution, we optimized land-use shares of two types
   of forest management (banning and allowing goat grazing) and three crops
   (maize, beans and peanuts). Land-use portfolios were calculated for four
   different farm sizes, represented by the quartiles of the farm size
   distribution. We found that goat grazing was important for diversifying
   farm income and reducing financial risks for all farm sizes. However,
   forest area would still be converted to cropland under the current
   financial coefficients. The amount of compensation needed to maintain
   current forest cover was calculated for two different scenarios: 1)
   banning goat grazing and 2) allowing forest use where the farmer could
   decide how much forest area would be allocated to each land-use option.
   Offering financial compensation for forest preservation (Scenario 1)
   reduced deforestation but would still lead to a conversion of at least
   23 \% of current forests to croplands. Allowing forest use in a
   compensation scheme (Scenario 2) would help retain 96 \% of the current
   forest cover, with 29 \% of this forest being set aside for
   conservation. This scenario would suppose annual payments ranging from
   \$4 to \$89 ha(-1), with the largest farms requiring the lowest
   payments. In contrast, banning goats from the forest would even risk
   losing the entire forest area to cropland, if compensation fell below
   \$50 ha(-1) yr(-1). We conclude that coupling productive options with
   secure compensation payments and developing policies that support
   land-use diversification and sustainable use of forest resources, will
   be most effective in conserving the Ecuadorian dry forest.}},

   steppe grassland, Qinghai Province, China}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-15}},
Abstract = {{Livestock grazing is the principal land use in arid central Asia, and
   range degradation is considered a serious problem within much of the
   high-elevation region of western China termed the Qinghai-Tibetan
   Plateau (QTP). Rangeland degradation on the QTP is variously attributed
   to poor livestock management, historical-cultural factors, changing land
   tenure arrangements or socioeconomic systems, climate change, and damage
   from small mammals. Few studies have examined currently managed pastures
   using detailed data capable of isolating fine-scale livestock-vegetation
   interactions. The aim of the study was to understand how differences
   among livestock (primarily sheep) management strategies of pastoralists
   during winter affected subsequent rangeland condition and productivity.
   Plant species composition, annual herbage mass, and indicators of
   erosion were quantified during four summers (2009-2012) on winter
   pastures managed by 11 different pastoralists on QTP steppe rangeland in
   Qinghai Province, China. Data came from repeated-measurements on 317
   systematically located permanent plots, as well as pastoralist
   interviews and the use of GPS-equipped livestock. Relationships between
   annual weather variation and herbage mass were modelled using an
   independent set of vegetation measurements obtained from livestock
   exclosures. Account was taken of inherent site differences among
   pastures. Annual variation in herbage mass was found to be best fitted
   by a model containing a negative function of winter-season temperature
   and a positive function of spring-season temperature. Accounting for
   annual and site effects, significant differences among pastoralists were
   found for most response variables, suggesting that individual
   heterogeneity among management approaches had consequences, even among
   neighbouring pastoralists. Annual herbage mass of preferred plant
   species was positively associated, whereas that of unpreferred species
   was negatively associated, with mean sheep density and intensity of use.
   However, the proportion of bare soil, an index of erosion, and annual
   herbage mass of unpreferred forbs were found to have positive
   relationships with sheep grazing pressure during the preceding winter,
   whereas live vegetation cover and annual herbage mass of preferred
   grasses were negatively related. Thus, on a spatial scale, pastoralists
   responded adaptively to the cover of preferred plant species while not
   responding to total annual herbage mass. Pastoralists stocked pastures
   more heavily, and livestock used regions within pastures more
   intensively, where preferred species had a higher cover. However, where
   sheep grazing pressure was high, downward temporal trends in the herbage
   mass of preferred species were exacerbated. Pastures that were stocked
   at a lower density did not experience the negative trends seen in those
   with a higher density.}},

Abstract = {{Overgrazing has caused vegetation destruction and soil degradation in
   Leymus chinensis grassland, the widely distributed type of grassland in
   northern China. To restore the degraded ecosystem, grazing exclusion was
   implemented in 1979, 1999, and 2004. However, changes in the vegetation
   and soil organic carbon (SOC) in different years of grazing exclusion
   have not been thoroughly elucidated. This paper examines the changes in
   vegetation characteristics (i.e., biomass, cover, richness, degree of
   succession, and shannon diversity index) and SOC under free of grazing
   (FG), 6 years (6 GE), 11 years (11 GE), and 31 years (31 GE) of grazing
   exclusion plots in the Xilin River Basin, China. The results indicate
   that the vegetation characteristics and SOC increased during the
   restoration process. Both the vegetation characteristics and SOC in 6 GE
   did not differ significantly from FG (p > 0.05), while these indexes in
   11 GE were significantly higher than in FG. The differences between the
   vegetation characteristics and SOC in 11 GE and those in 31 GE were not
   significant. To meet the tradeoff between ecosystem conservation and
   utilization, further studies with multi-year observation should be
   conducted to identify the optimal duration of grazing exclusion and the

Journal = {{FOOD POLICY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A method was developed for designing `fair' diets (not using more than
   globally available arable land per capita) and for assessing the
   sustainability of such diets. The diets were based on the principle of
   `ecological leftovers' for livestock production, i.e. raising livestock
   on pasture and by-products not suitable for or wanted by humans. The
   method was applied to Sweden using three different scenarios for
   livestock production, all taking the starting point that semi-natural
   pastures should be grazed by ruminants for reasons of biodiversity
   conservation. The scenarios also included differing use of by-products
   (from crop production and food processing) to either boost milk
   production (I-Milk scenario) or produce eggs and pig meat (E-Milk and
   Suckler scenarios). In I-Milk, milk and meat were produced in intensive
   systems in which dairy cows and their offspring only grazed to a limited
   extent, resulting in the human diet containing recommended levels of
   dairy products (350 ml milk per day) and meat twice a week. Milk could
   also be exported. In E-Milk, pasture was used more for dairy cows and
   their offspring, resulting in fewer animals and less milk (150 ml milk
   per day) and four servings of meat per week. In the Suckler scenario,
   pasture was grazed by suckler herds providing no milk but meat four
   times per week. The environmental impacts of the diets were assessed
   using the planetary boundaries framework. The results showed
   substantially lower environmental impacts compared with the average
   current Swedish diet, but the strict absolute climate boundary and the N
   and P input boundaries were still exceeded for all diets. The approach
   adopted, of letting the ecological resource capacity act as the
   constraining factor for livestock production, is in line with
   agroecology principles and efficient use of land to improve food
   security, and could be useful in discussions about sustainable
   consumption of animal products. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{1. Large mammalian herbivores (LMH) exert strong effects on plants in
   tropical savannas, and many wild LMH populations are declining. However,
   predicting the impacts of these declines on vegetation structure remains
   challenging.
   2. Experiments suggest that tree cover can increase rapidly following
   LMH exclusion. Yet it is unclear whether these results scale up to
   predict ecosystem-level impacts of LMH declines, which often alter fire
   regimes, trigger compensatory responses of other herbivores and
   accompany anthropogenic land-use changes. Moreover, theory predicts that
   grazers and browsers should have opposing effects on tree cover, further
   complicating efforts to forecast the outcomes of community-wide
   declines.
   3. We used the near-extirpation of grazing and browsing LMH from
   Gorongosa National Park during the Mozambican Civil War (1977-1992) as a
   natural experiment to test whether megafaunal collapse increased tree
   cover. We classified herbaceous and tree cover in satellite images taken
   (a) at the onset of war in 1977 and (b) in 2012, two decades after
   hostilities ceased.
   4. Throughout the 3620-km(2) park, proportional tree cover increased by
   34\% (from 0.29 to 0.39) an addition of 362 km(2). Four of the park's
   five major habitat zones (including miombo woodland,
   Acacia-Combretum-palm savanna, and floodplain grassland) showed even
   greater increases in tree cover (51-134\%), with an average increase of
   94\% in ecologically critical Rift Valley habitats. Only in the eastern
   Cheringoma Plateau, which had historically low wildlife densities, did
   tree cover decrease (by 5\%).
   5. The most parsimonious explanation for these results is that reduced
   browsing pressure enhanced tree growth, survival and/or recruitment; we
   found no directional trends in rainfall or fire that could explain
   increased tree cover.
   6. Synthesis. Catastrophic large-herbivore die-offs in Mozambique's
   flagship national park were followed by 35 years of woodland expansion,
   most severely in areas where pre-war wildlife biomass was greatest.
   These findings suggest that browsing release supersedes
   grazer-grass-fire feedbacks in governing ecosystem-level tree cover,
   consistent with smaller-scale experimental results, although the
   potentially complementary effect of CO2 fertilization cannot be
   definitively ruled out. Future work in Gorongosa will reveal whether
   recovering LMH populations reverse this trend, or alternatively whether
   woody encroachment hinders ongoing restoration efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Spanish mountains have been affected by the expansion of shrubs and
   forests since the mid-20th century. This secondary succession in
   vegetation has some positive effects, but also drawbacks, such as an
   increase in fire risk, loss of diversity in land use, a reduction in
   landscape and cultural value, less water available in river channels and
   reservoirs, constraints on livestock farming, a reduced number of local
   species and loss of biodiversity. This paper analyses the potential for
   grazing domestic goats to help control the spread of several species of
   shrubs such as the common broom (Cytisus scoparius), red raspberry
   (Rubus idaeus) and roses (Rosa sp.) that are commonly found in degraded
   pastures in the Cantabrian Mountains of northern Spain. Using
   experimental plots, the effects of two levels of stocking density (45
   and 9 goatsha(-1) y(-1)) are compared with other land management systems
   used in the region: burning, mechanical clearing and trimming. The
   combined use of goats with support from burning, clearing and trimming
   controls the spread of shrubs. The most efficient treatment was found

   of shrubs, transforming a dense and continuous coverage into separate
   clumps and thereby enabling livestock to graze more easily. Maintaining
   a mixed structure of shrubs and pastures is the best treatment due to
   the low population density of the Cantabrian Mountains, as this enhances
   the biodiversity, controls fire risk and enriches the landscape; it also
   allows extensive livestock grazing as a main economic resource.

Abstract = {{Questions: Are exotic plant species favoured by non-native ungulate
   herbivores and disadvantaged by native herbivores in forested
   rangelands? Do the impacts of ungulates on exotic vs native plants
   depend on forest management activities such as prescribed fire and stand
   thinning?
   Location: Northeastern Oregon, USA.
   Methods: We recorded changes in richness and cover of different exotic
   and native plant life forms in experimental plots that were grazed only
   by cattle (a non-native herbivore), only by elk (a native herbivore) or
   not grazed by any ungulate over a 7-yr period at both managed (recently
   burned and thinned) and unmanaged (where no fire and thinning has
   occurred in >40 yr) forest stands.
   Results: There was a general decrease in exotic plant species richness
   and cover across all treatments. However, the decrease in exotic
   richness, particularly of exotic annual forbs, was slightly lower in
   plots grazed by elk than in ungrazed plots at managed stands. Managed
   stands also displayed a larger increase in native annual forb richness
   and exotic graminoid richness, and a larger decrease in native perennial
   graminoid cover with cattle grazing than elk grazing. At unmanaged
   stands, cover of woody native plants such as shrubs, sub-shrubs and
   trees as well as native perennial forbs decreased or remained relatively
   constant with elk grazing while increasing strongly at plots that were
   ungrazed or grazed by cattle.
   Conclusions: Cattle and elk have variable effects on different plant
   guilds at managed vs unmanaged forest stands. Overall, cattle grazing
   tends to have a larger impact on herbaceous plant guilds at managed
   stands, while elk grazing tends to have a larger impact on woody plant
   guilds at unmanaged stands. However, in contrast to findings from other
   ecosystems, grazing only has a minor impact on exotic plant dynamics in
   our study area, and cattle grazing does not favour exotic plants any
   more than grazing by elk or ungulate exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing has shaped grassland ecosystems around the world.
   Previous studies indicated grazing showed various impacts on small
   rodents; however, most studies were conducted over 1-2 years without
   controlling for confounding factors such as immigration/emigration and
   predation in rodents. Brandt's voles (Lasiopodomys brandtii) are
   generally recognized as pests because of food overlap with domestic
   herbivores, but are also important for biodiversity conservation because
   they provide nests or food to many birds. Fully understanding the
   ecological relationship between domestic herbivores and small mammals is
   essential to making ecosystem management decisions. To address these
   needs, we carried out a field experiment during the period 2010-2013 to
   assess the effects of sheep grazing on vegetation and the population
   density of Brandt's voles along a gradient of three grazing intensities
   by using 12 large-scale enclosures. Responses of Brandt's voles to
   livestock grazing varied with grazing intensity and year. As compared to
   the control group, sheep grazing had no effect on vole abundance in the
   first year but an overall negative effect on vole abundance in the
   following 3 years. Successive grazing caused decreases in survival and
   male body mass of voles, but had no significant effect on fecundity.
   Negative effects of grazing were associated with a grazing-induced
   deterioration in both food quantity (reflected by biomass and cover of
   less-preferred plants), and food quality (measured by tannin and total
   phenol content). Our findings highlight the urgent need for more
   flexible management of yearly rotational grazing to optimize livestock
   production while maintaining species diversity and ecosystem health.}},

Abstract = {{Land use change is one of the main drivers of species extinction. In
   Europe, grasslands are under active conflict between conservation
   efforts and increasing agricultural pressures. Here, we examine the
   demographic effects of differential land use on the herbaceous perennial
   Trollius europaeus L. (Ranunculaceae), a bioindicator of
   species-richness and ecosystem services in wet grasslands of Central
   Europe. Demographic data were collected in 2006-2009 from nine
   populations in seven protected sites of northeastern Germany
   representing four land use types. We constructed stage-based matrix
   population models to explore the effects of various land management on
   demographic viability of focal populations. We show that most studied
   populations are declining (lambda < 1), although the estimates of local
   extinction vary between a parts per thousand currency sign15 years for
   grazed and woodland populations, and 20-99 years for mown and abandoned
   populations. The joint information from our elasticity analyses and life
   table response experiments revealed that reproduction, growth of small
   vegetative individuals and survival of reproductive stages are most
   important for population viability. Our study shows that the current
   land uses in protected areas where T. europaeus is found is incompatible
   with its long-term viability. We suggest that, when compatible with in
   situ practices, grasslands containing this species be mown after
   maturity in order to enhance seedling recruitment and to reduce
   competition for juveniles. Prolonged extinction times in abandoned
   populations offer a buffer to develop conservation schemes there. An
   improvement of conservation measures is urgently needed to maintain the

Abstract = {{Improving models that depict the components of net primary production
   (NPP) in ecosystems will help us to better understand how climate change
   and human activities affect the biosphere. In this study, NPPgap was
   introduced into the present human appropriation of net primary

   potential NPP (NPPpot) minus the sum of ecosystem NPP (NPPeco) and
   HANPP, which relates to the ability of models to depict NPP components.
   Using the Lhasa River region of the Tibetan Plateau, we examined
   temporal and spatial variations in the components of NPP over a 10-year
   period. Results showed that NPPpot, HANPP and NPPeco increased from 2000
   to 2010, but at different rates and with different spatial patterns.
   NPPgap each year ranged from -9.2\% to 13.1\% for each site and on
   average composed 1.2\% of the total NPPpot. NPPgap was significantly
   correlated with precipitation, plant biodiversity, plant height and soil
   properties. NPPgap increased if either of the previous 2 years had been
   wet years with relative high precipitation. An increase in the richness
   of palatable species would lead to a larger NPPgap through more
   compensatory growth. The large fluctuation level of NPPgap reflected the
   higher stability of vegetation productivity, which is caused by higher
   plant heights and soil maximum water capacity. This study showed the
   potential of the HANPP framework in regional assessment of climate and
   human impacts on net primary productivity. The use of the NPPgap measure
   reflects the gap in our knowledge and our ability to accurately estimate
   the components of NPP. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the steppe of Inner Mongolia, forage is the only source of feed for
   sheep. The forage intake of sheep can be characterized in both quantity
   and quality terms, which are determined by environmental and
   anthropogenic factors and grazing has a strong effect on steppe
   productivity And the grassland ecosystem. Evaluation of forage quality
   and quantity is therefore of critical importance. The effects of grazing
   intensity, interannual variability effects, and species composition on
   aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and forage nutritional
   characteristics were investigated in a controlled grazing experiment
   along a gradient of 7 grazing intensities (from non-grazed to very
   heavily grazed) over six years (2005-2010) on typical steppe in Inner
   Mongolia. Forage nutritional characteristics were defined by the
   nutritional value (concentrations of crude protein (CP), cellulase
   digestible organic matter (CDOM), metabolizable energy (ME) and neutral
   detergent fibre (NDF)) and the nutritional yield. The forage nutritional
   yield is a function of ANPP and the forage nutritional value. Forage
   nutritional value increased but ANPP and nutritional yields decreased
   with increasing grazing intensity. The inter-annual variation of ANPP,
   forage nutritional value and yield were weakly linked to the
   inter-annual variability of precipitation. However, ANPP and nutritional
   value also varied during the growing season, depending on the seasonal
   distribution of precipitation and temperature, which influence forage
   digestibility (CDOM) and metabolizable energy (ME), with higher CDOM and
   ME under high seasonal precipitation and low seasonal mean temperature.
   Forage nutritional value and yield, as well as ANPP, were predominantly
   determined by the dominant species rather than by species diversity. The
   results suggest that forage nutritional yield in the Inner Mongolian
   steppe is predominantly determined by the ANPP and only to a minor
   extent by forage nutritional value, and is predominantly determined by
   the dominant species and only to a minor extent by species diversity.
   Therefore, herbage productivity seems to be the most limiting factor in
   managing this steppe ecosystem as a feeding resource for livestock and
   to be the best ecological and environmental indicator for grassland
   management practices. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Forest fragmentation constitutes one of the main consequences of land
   cover change worldwide. Through this process gaps in habitat coverage
   are created and the ability of populations in the remaining fragments to
   maintain themselves is put in doubt. Hence, two options need to be
   considered: conserving the remaining forest fragments, and restoring
   habitat in some deforested patches with the aim of reestablishing the
   connections among the fragments. We established a mathematical index
   (SIR) that describes the suitability of individual habitat patches for
   restoration within a landscape. The index considers classes of distances
   among fragments and categories of habitat quality in the areas
   surrounding the fragments to assess habitat quality in terms of
   probability of dispersal and survival of propagules (especially seeds
   and cutting). In the present study, we created detailed maps depicting
   SIR values for two periods (1988 and 2011) for Sorocaba region (Sao
   Paulo State, Brazil). We derived land cover maps from satellite images
   for the two years of our study, and then surveyed the transition of land
   cover categories and landscape metrics between years. A model for the
   SIR was created using a map of distance classes among fragments and also
   a map of habitat quality established according to each land cover
   category. For both 1988 and 2011, pasture was the predominant land cover
   category. The main land cover transitions were from pasture to urban
   (10.6\%) and from pasture to forest fragments (13.4\%). Although the
   land cover class ``wood sites{''} increased, the data of SIR revealed
   that the areas of habitat categorized as excellent and good both
   decreased, while habitat classes categorized as poor and very poor
   increased. Our model has the potential to be applied to other regions
   where the forest is fragmented. Hence, local policy makers will be able
   to use this model to determine local patches of high value for
   conservation and also the most ideal locations for restoration projects.

Abstract = {{In native campos of Uruguay, overseeding legumes coupled with phosphorus
   (P) fertilization is a technology used to increase animal production.
   Short-term improvements in both forage productivity and quality are
   repeatedly reported. However, some evidence suggests that this
   management may at times lead to the collapse of the native community and
   invasions by exotic species. Indeed, it is yet unclear to what extent
   overseeding legumes into native grasslands affects its long-term
   integrity. This study uses data from a long-term experiment to assess
   whether increased P fertilizer rates-typically used to encourage legume
   establishment and growth-are associated with reduced species diversity.
   In 1996 a grazed native grassland in eastern Uruguay was either left
   untouched (control) or overseeded with a mix of Trifolium repens and
   Lotus corniculatus and then fertilized at either a moderate or high rate
   of P (197 or 394 kg.ha(-1) over 13 years, respectively). The three
   treatments were arranged in a randomized block design with four
   replicates of 2 hectares each. In 2005 the experiment was exhaustively
   sampled: 11 georeferenced sampling points per replicate, each
   encompassing similar to 20 m(2). Extractable P was measured in the 0-5-
   and 5-15-cmsoil layers. In 2009, species presence and cover were
   measured at the same points. Across treatments, wherever legumes were
   introduced, extractable soil P was negatively related to species
   richness and diversity (P b 0.01) and native grass cover was reduced.
   This effect became asymptotic once soil P exceeded 27 and 36 mg.kg(-1)
   of P (0-5 cm), respectively. Therefore the documented reduction in
   species richness and diversity suggests a trade-off between increased
   pasture production and decreased vegetation stability may be operating
   in response to P fertilization of overseeded grasslands. The underlying
   ecophysiological mechanisms, as well as grazing management options to
   mitigate species diversity decline, should be further studied. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{There is a great need to understand the effects of man-made land
   transformation on freshwater biodiversity, because agricultural
   landscapes provide habitat for many aquatic and semi-aquatic organisms.
   However, not all forms of land use are equal in their capacity to
   support wildlife. Cattle grazing leads to a change in pasture vegetation
   structure, whereas conversion to commercial crop-based agriculture
   promotes structural and chemical degradation of the ecosystem. From 2010
   to 2012, in the Pampa biome, southern Brazil, we modelled anuran
   occupancy for 39 farmland ponds. Specifically, we determined detection
   probabilities associated with survey- and pond-specific variables and
   examined tadpole occupancy in relation to land use in southern Brazil.
   We recorded eleven anuran species, but only five were detected at levels
   suitable for occupancy modelling. Species detectability varied with
   water temperature, extent of floating macrophyte cover, and sampling
   date. For three species, detection-adjusted occupancy models indicated a
   relationship between occupancy and agricultural activities and/or
   livestock management. Agriculture areas negatively affected occupancy by
   Odontophrynus americanus and Physalaemus gracilis. The presence of
   livestock within a 500 m radius positively affected pond occupancy by
   Hypsiboas pulchellus. Other species were negatively associated with pond
   area or fish presence. Our results demonstrate that traditional
   extensive livestock farming can provide a buffer that protects
   freshwater environments, because it did not greatly modify the grassland
   matrix. We argue that further species-based approaches will be critical
   for developing effective conservation strategies for anurans,

Abstract = {{Grassland systems provide important habitat for native biodiversity and
   forage for livestock, with livestock grazing playing an important role
   influencing sustainable ecosystem function. Traditional field techniques
   to monitor the effects of grazing on vegetation are costly and limited
   to small spatial scales. Remote sensing has the potential to provide
   quantitative and repeatable monitoring data across large spatial and
   temporal scales for more informed grazing management. To investigate the
   ability of vegetation metrics derived from remotely sensed imagery to
   detect the effect of cattle grazing on bunchgrass grassland vegetation
   across a growing season, we sampled 32 sites across four prescribed
   stocking rates on a section of Pacific Northwest bunchgrass prairie in
   northeastern Oregon. We collected vegetation data on vertical structure,
   biomass, and cover at three different time periods: June, August, and
   October 2012 to understand the potential to measure vegetation at
   different phenological stages across a growing season. We acquired
   remotely sensed Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data
   closest in date to three field sampling bouts. We correlated the field
   vegetation metrics to Landsat spectral bands, 14 commonly used
   vegetation indices, and the tasselled cap wetness, brightness, and
   greenness transformations. To increase the explanatory value of the
   satellite-derived data, full, stepwise, and best-subset multiple
   regression models were fit to each of the vegetation metrics at the
   three different times of the year. Predicted vegetation metrics were
   then mapped across the study area. Field-based results indicated that as
   the stocking rate increased, the mean vegetation amounts of vertical
   structure, cover, and biomass decreased. The multiple regression models
   using common vegetation indices had the ability to discern different
   levels of grazing across the study area, but different spectral indices
   proved to be the best predictors of vegetation metrics for differing
   phenological windows. Field measures of vegetation cover yielded the
   highest correlations to remotely sensed data across all sampling
   periods. Our results from this analysis can be used to improve grassland
   monitoring by providing multiple measures of vegetation amounts across a
   growing season that better align with land management decision making.}},

Abstract = {{RivFunction is a pan-European initiative that started in 2002 and was
   aimed at establishing a novel functional-based approach to assessing the
   ecological status of rivers. Litter decomposition was chosen as the
   focal process because it plays a central role in stream ecosystems and
   is easy to study in the field. Impacts of two stressors that occur
   across the continent, nutrient pollution and modified riparian
   vegetation, were examined at >200 paired sites in nine European
   ecoregions. In response to the former, decomposition was dramatically
   slowed at both extremes of a 1000-fold nutrient gradient, indicating
   nutrient limitation in unpolluted sites, highly variable responses
   across Europe in moderately impacted streams, and inhibition via
   associated toxic and additional stressors in highly polluted streams.
   Riparian forest modification by clear cutting or replacement of natural
   vegetation by plantations (e.g. conifers, eucalyptus) or pasture
   produced similarly complex responses. Clear effects caused by specific
   riparian disturbances were observed in regionally focused studies, but
   general trends across different types of riparian modifications were not
   apparent, in part possibly because of important indirect effects.
   Complementary field and laboratory experiments were undertaken to tease
   apart the mechanistic drivers of the continental scale field bioassays
   by addressing the influence of litter, fungal and detritivore diversity.
   These revealed generally weak and context-dependent effects on
   decomposition, suggesting high levels of redundancy (and hence potential
   insurance mechanisms that can mitigate a degree of species loss) within
   the food web. Reduced species richness consistently increased
   decomposition variability, if not the absolute rate. Further field
   studies were aimed at identifying important sources of this variability
   (e.g. litter quality, temporal variability) to help constrain ranges of
   predicted decomposition rates in different field situations. Thus,
   although many details still need to be resolved, litter decomposition
   holds considerable potential in some circumstances to capture impairment
   of stream ecosystem functioning. For instance, species traits associated
   with the body size and metabolic capacity of the consumers were often
   the main driver at local scales, and these were often translated into
   important determinants of otherwise apparently contingent effects at
   larger scales. Key insights gained from conducting continental scale
   studies included resolving the apparent paradox of inconsistent
   relationships between nutrients and decomposition rates, as the full
   complex multidimensional picture emerged from the large-scale dataset,
   of which only seemingly contradictory fragments had been seen
   previously.}},

   biotic attributes (e.g., species richness) in maintaining fundamental
   ecosystem processes such as primary productivity, illustrates how
   nitrogen deposition and grazing pressure are impacting ecosystem
   functioning in drylands worldwide, and highlights the importance of the
   traits of woody species as drivers of their expansion in former

   richness and abundance in controlling the responses of ecosystem
   functioning to climate change. This knowledge is essential to guide
   conservation and restoration efforts in drylands, as biotic attributes
   can be actively managed at the local scale to increase ecosystem

Abstract = {{Question: Do restoration measures involving yearly biomass removal over
   9 yr have a beneficial effect on the structure and composition of
   long-term abandoned European steppe-like grassland? What is the effect
   of a single accidental fire event on this grassland community?
   Location: Continental dry steppe-like grassland, Suatu and Puini,
   Transylvania, Romania.
   Methods: In two long-term abandoned grassland sites, we experimentally
   carried out annual biomass removal by clipping and raking, and by raking
   alone over a period of 9 yr. We analysed the effect of the two planned
   treatments in both sites and that of an accidental fire in one of the
   sites on the structure and composition of vegetation. We applied a
   predominantly functional trait-based analysis, but the dominant species
   Stipa pulcherrima and Carex humilis were treated separately.
   Results: Annual biomass removal applied for 9 yr at one site favoured
   sub-dominant grasses and short-lived forbs over long-lived forbs and the
   two dominant species, and generated a successional shift to more open
   grassland. The clipping and raking treatment promoted plot-scale species
   richness when the grassland species pool was large enough. The number
   and abundance of Red-Listed species were not influenced by our
   treatments. The single accidental fire event at one of the sites
   negatively affected the two dominant species and promoted one of the
   sub-dominant grasses. In addition, burning in combination with
   abandonment and presence of stoloniferous grass species benefiting from
   fire decreased species richness. Variation in weather conditions, in
   particular the series of dry years during our experiment, caused
   significant changes in vegetation cover and the quantity of litter, and
   decreased the abundance of S. pulcherrima in both sites and that of
   long-lived forbs in one site.
   Conclusions: According to our results, biomass removal had a beneficial
   effect on vegetation structure and composition in long-term abandoned
   steppe-like grassland. Until further experimental data on the effect of
   burning on temperate dry grassland are available, traditional management
   practices should be favoured over alternativemethods.}},

   communities}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{210-222}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Globally important U.K. fens are in poor condition, principally due to
   abandonment, following cessation of traditional mowing and grazing in
   recent decades. In the absence of management, rich fen flora are
   displaced as a result of succession. This leads to an increase in
   competitive species and subsequent biomass accumulation. In order to
   reverse this trajectory and increase species richness, management
   consisting of a single mowing event was employed. Mowing was conducted
   in two degraded fen communities in north-west Wales (U.K.) across three
   sites: (i) a species rich, tussock alkaline mire, dominated by Schoenus
   nigri cans and Juncus subnodulosus (SN community) and (ii) a species
   poor basin mire Cladio-Mohnietum dominated by Cladium mariscus (CM
   community). The early vegetation responses were monitored over two
   years. Results show a large treatment effect on species richness in the
   CM community, where mean species richness increased by 51\% in the
   second year following mowing. Consequently, total species number across
   all sites increased to 74 in the treatment compared to 44 in the
   control. Mowing reduced vegetation height and litter cover and increased
   bare ground. These treatment effects combined with a reduction in
   graminoid and shrub cover collectively contributed to the initial stages
   of rehabilitation. Conversely, the SN community showed no increase in
   species richness, in spite of a reduction in litter cover and increased
   bare ground. Strong site heterogeneity and a sustained canopy height
   caused by rapid re-growth of the dominant graminoid S. nigri cans may
   have impeded treatment effects. Therefore, increased mowing frequency in
   alternate years, switching between autumn and summer would be necessary
   to develop species richness in the SN community. Ongoing intervention in
   each fen community is needed to achieve an optimal trajectory of
   increased rich fen and reduction of secondary succession species. (C)

Abstract = {{Species abundance is typically determined by the abiotic environment,

   herb Ligusticum porteri. Yearly surveys consistently found aphids to be
   more than 17-fold more abundant on open meadow plants than on shaded
   understory plants. Manipulations demonstrated that this abundance
   pattern was not due to the direct effects of light environment on aphid
   performance, or indirectly through host plant quality or the effects of
   predators. Instead, open meadows had higher ant abundance and per capita
   rates of aphid tending and, accordingly, ants increased aphid population
   growth in meadow but not understory environments. The abiotic
   environment thus drives the abundance of this herbivore exclusively
   through the mediation of a protection mutualism.}},

Title = {{How are biodiversity and dispersal of species affected by the management
   of roadsides? A systematic map protocol}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Background: In many parts of the world, roadsides are regularly managed
   for traffic-safety reasons. Hence, there are similarities between
   roadsides and certain other managed habitats, such as wooded pastures
   and mown or grazed grasslands. In contrast to roadsides, the latter
   habitats have declined rapidly in Europe during the last century, and
   today only a fraction of their former extent remains. For many species
   historically associated with these habitats, roadsides may therefore
   function as new primary habitats or as dispersal corridors in fragmented
   landscapes. Current recommendations for roadside management to promote
   conservation values are largely based on studies of plants in
   semi-natural grasslands, although such areas often differ from roadsides
   in terms of environmental factors and impacts. Moreover, roadsides
   provide habitats not only for plants but also for many insects,
   especially if they are sandy and exposed to the sun. For these reasons,
   stakeholders in Sweden have emphasised the need for more targeted
   management recommendations, based on actual studies of roadside
   biodiversity.
   Methods: The proposed systematic map is intended to provide an overview
   of the available evidence on how biodiversity is affected by various
   forms of roadside management, and how such management influences the
   dispersal of species along roads or roadsides. Relevant interventions
   include e.g. mowing, shrub removal, control of invasive/nuisance
   species, sowing or planting, burning, grazing by livestock, scraping and
   ditching. Non-intervention or alternative forms of roadside management
   will be used as comparators. Relevant outcomes include measures of
   species or genetic diversity, the abundance of individual species or
   groups of organisms, species distribution patterns, and movement rates
   of individuals or propagules. Searches will be made for peer-reviewed
   and grey literature in English and several other languages. No
   geographical restrictions will be applied, and all species and species
   groups will be considered.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Livestock grazing and `overabundance' of large wild
   herbivores in forested areas have long been perceived as conflicting
   with the aims of both silviculture and forest conservation; however,
   certain kinds of herbivory can help to maintain habitat values in forest
   ecosystems. Management of grazing/browsing in protected forests can,
   therefore, be a critical tool for biodiversity conservation. However, it
   is not clear what impacts of wild ungulates or livestock are tolerable
   or desirable in forests set aside for conservation or restoration. The
   primary aim of the proposed systematic review is to clarify how the
   diversity of plants and invertebrates is affected by manipulation of the
   grazing/browsing pressure by livestock or wild ungulates. The ultimate
   purpose of the review is to investigate whether such manipulation is
   useful as a means of conserving or restoring biodiversity in forest
   set-asides.
   Methods: The review will examine primary field studies of how fencing or
   other kinds of manipulation of the grazing/browsing pressure by
   livestock or wild ungulates affects plants or invertebrates. We will
   consider studies made in boreal or temperate forests anywhere in the
   world, incorporating investigations made not only in protected areas but
   also in stands under commercial management. Non-intervention or
   alternative levels of grazing pressure will be used as comparators.
   Relevant outcomes include abundance, diversity and composition of plants
   and invertebrates, tree regeneration, and performance of focal/target
   species. Relevant studies will mainly be selected from a recent
   systematic map of the evidence on biodiversity impacts of active
   management in forest set-asides. A search update will be made with a
   subset of the search terms used for the systematic map. Searches for
   additional literature will be made in bibliographies of existing
   reviews. Relevant studies will be subject to critical appraisal and
   categorised as having high, medium or low susceptibility to bias.
   Studies with high susceptibility to bias will be excluded from the
   review. Useful outcomes and data on interventions and other potential
   effect modifiers will be extracted from included articles. A narrative
   synthesis will describe the quality and findings of all studies in the
   review. Where studies report similar outcomes, meta-analysis will be

Title = {{The Abundance, Diversity, and Metabolic Footprint of Soil Nematodes Is
   Highest in High Elevation Alpine Grasslands}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Nematodes are key components of soil biodiversity and represent valuable
   bio-indicators of soil food webs. Numerous community indices have been
   developed in order to track variations in nematode-mediate soil
   ecosystem processes, but their use is mainly restricted to anthropogenic
   stresses. In this study, we propose to expand the use of nematodes'
   derived ecological indices in order to shed light on variations of soil
   food webs in natural systems distributed along elevation gradients. For
   this purpose, we aimed at determining how elevation affects the
   community structure and the trophic diversity by studying the abundance,
   the composition and the functional diversity of nematode communities.
   Nematode communities were sampled every 200 m across five transects that
   span about 2000 m in elevation in the Alps. To understand the underlying
   ecological parameters driving these patterns we studied both abiotic
   factors (soil properties) and biotic factors (trophic links,
   relationships with plant diversity). We found that (1) nematode
   abundance increases with elevation of lowland forests and alpine
   meadows; (2) differences in nematodes communities rely on
   habitat-specific functional diversity (e.g., tolerance to harsh
   environments, ``colonizer/persister{''} status) while most trophic
   groups are ubiquitous; and (3) the metabolic footprint of the complete
   nematode community increases with elevation. We thus conclude that the
   contribution of soil dwelling nematodes to belowground ecosystem
   processes, including carbon and energy flow, is stronger at high
   elevation. The resulting cascading effects on the soil food web
   structure are discussed from an ecosystem functioning perspective.
   Overall, this study highlights the importance of nematodes in soil
   ecosystems and brings insights on their functional role along ecological
   gradients.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural landscapes in Ethiopia have undergone unprecedented
   changes. The direction of change, however, is unsustainable as
   manifested in land degradation, biodiversity loss, and low agricultural
   productivity. The objective of this study is to examine the patterns and
   trends of agricultural landscape development and responses of the local
   people within the framework of the dynamics of demography, socioeconomic
   conditions, politics, and natural resources in the Chencha and Arbaminch
   areas, Southern Ethiopia, during the last century. Information on
   cultivated and grazing land areas was acquired by satellite image
   interpretation. Interviews and group discussions provided important
   information on agricultural land use systems. A review and an analysis
   of secondary sources and documents of past studies were also used for
   trend analysis as a baseline and a supplement to oral history. The
   results show that cultivated land was expanded by 39\% from 1973 until
   2006, but per capita farming land holdings decreased enormously. In the
   same period of time, grassland shrank by 69\% thus causing a significant
   decrease in livestock. Cultivated land scarcity can mostly be related to
   demographic pressure, which was exacerbated by government policy, land
   tenure, and the nature of subsistence agriculture. The farmers, however,
   were resourceful and developed skills over millennia to cope with the
   problems associated with population density and scarce resources.
   However, these traditional land use activities and land management
   practices have been deteriorating recently. Land use planners and
   environmental managers should take local knowledge and innovation into
   account in order to make sound decisions for the future.}},

   Aims: Here, we examine the relationship between productivity, functional
   group dominance and plant species richness at the plot scale in Tibetan
   Plateau meadows. These alpine meadows are ideal to examine the species
   productivity-richness relationship because they have a very high species
   richness, a large gradient in productivity, and can be dominated by
   either graminoids (grasses and sedges) or forbs.
   Methods: We measured plant species richness and above-ground biomass
   along a natural gradient of functional group abundance in 44 plots
   distributed across five natural, winter-grazed but otherwise undisturbed
   sites in the eastern part of the Qing-Hai Tibetan Plateau, in Gansu
   province, China in 2008.
   Results: Graminoid abundance (i.e. graminoid biomass as percent of the
   total above-ground biomass) explained 39\% of plot differences in
   species richness while neither productivity nor the biomass of the three
   most abundant plant species, either individually or combined, were a
   significant predictor of species richness.
   Conclusions: Our results show that within these alpine meadows, a shift
   from graminoid to forb dominance, rather than the individual dominant
   species or productivity itself, is strongly correlated with species
   richness. Thus, differences in functional group abundance can be a
   strong driver of observed plant species richness patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Overgrazing has driven degradation and desertification of semi-arid
   grasslands in Northern China over recent decades. Selective grazing by
   sheep influences sward structure by inducing heterogeneous vegetation
   patterns comprising overgrazed hotspots and areas rejected by grazing
   sheep. In this study, we examined the effects of grazing intensity
   (ungrazed, light and heavy grazing in 2008 and 2010) and grazing system
   (a mixed system involving continuous grazing alternating annually with
   hay making vs. a continuous system involving continuous utilization of
   the same area for grazing) on plant biomass distribution and ecosystem
   functioning after 4 years and 6 years of controlled grazing in a
   semi-arid steppe of Inner Mongolia, China. The spatial biomass
   distribution was determined by sward height measurements converted to
   biomass and afterwards visualized in biomass distribution
   semivariograms. Within each of the different areas: grazed (i.e., areas
   frequently grazed by sheep), rejected (i.e., areas largely avoided by
   grazing sheep) and fenced (i.e., areas from which grazing had been
   excluded by fencing), plant species and soil parameters were sampled in
   order to analyze the mechanisms and effects of grazing patterns on
   ecosystem functioning. The results revealed a more homogeneous biomass
   distribution in the ungrazed and heavily grazed plots compared to
   lightly grazed plots, in which heterogeneous biomass distribution
   patterns included both overgrazed hotspots and rejected areas. The patch
   vegetation patterns were consistent between years only under light
   grazing intensity. However, patch vegetation patterns in the continuous
   system did not necessarily indicate negative effects on grassland
   ecosystem functioning. Within the 6 years of grazing experiment, it
   appears that patchy structure rather than homogeneous patterns showed
   higher biodiversity, significant variations in litter, soil water
   content and soil temperature and smaller effects on belowground biomass
   and carbon storage. Therefore, heterogeneous patchy vegetation patterns
   are likely to moderate grassland recovery and optimize ecosystem
   functioning by forming resource islands with sufficient water and
   nutrients in the short run. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   different annual rates of cattle slurry (0, 60, 120, 180, 240 kg N

   Slurry application positively affected soil fertility by increasing pH,

   5.75 and 6.09 t ha(-1) in 0, 60,120, 180 and 240 treatments,

   was no surplus of N, K and Ca up to an N application rate of 120 kg

   treatments, the main change in vegetation was an increase in graminoids

Abstract = {{Climate warming may disrupt trophic interactions, consequently
   influencing ecosystem functioning. Most studies have concentrated on the
   temperature-effects on plant-insect interactions at individual and
   population levels, with a particular emphasis on changes in phenology
   and distribution. Nevertheless, the available evidence from the
   community level is limited. A 3-year field manipulative experiment was
   performed to test potential responses of plant and insect communities,
   and plantinsect interactions, to elevated temperature in a meadow
   steppe. Warming increased the biomass of plant community and forbs, and
   decreased grass biomass, indicating a shift from grass-dominant to
   grass-forb mixed plant community. Reduced abundance of the insect
   community under warming, particularly the herbivorous insects, was
   attributed to lower abundance of Euchorthippus unicolor and a
   Cicadellidae species resulting from lower food availability and higher
   defensive herbivory. Lower herbivore abundance caused lower predator
   species richness because of reduced prey resources and contributed to an
   overall decrease in insect species richness. Interestingly, warming
   enhanced the positive relationship between insect and plant species
   richness, implying that the strength of the plant-insect interactions
   was altered by warming. Our results suggest that alterations to
   plant-insect interactions at a community level under climate warming in

Abstract = {{Grasslands may mitigate rising levels of the atmospheric `greenhouse
   gas' carbon dioxide by C sequestration in soil organic matter, depending
   on several environmental and management factors. The objective of this
   study was to examine the effects of long-term (19 years) different
   cutting frequencies (CFs), using equal amounts of mineral fertilisers
   (173 kg N, 40 kg P, and 150 kg K ha(-1) year(-1)), on some sward and
   soil properties of previous extensively fertilised and utilised
   bio-diverse wet grassland. The impact of the study was directed towards
   the soil organic C and the apparent N budget. The CFs during the
   grassland experiment were cut at 2,4,6,8,10, and 12-weekly intervals. CF
   significantly affected the sward and the soil characteristics of the
   grassland. The average number of plants per plot was high at medium CFs
   and low at low CFs. The above-ground biomass yield was high at medium
   and at low CFs, and its N content was high at medium and at high CFs.
   Soil organic C stocks (SOCS), soil total N stocks (STNS), and soil bulk
   density showed significant interactive responses to CFs x soil depths (0
   cm, 10-20 cm). Due to high amounts of symbiotically fixed N by legumes
   at higher CFs, the average above-ground biomass yields contained more N
   than was added with fertilizers. In contrast to the second soil layer,
   the first soil layer in those treatments was rich in SOCS and STNS. In
   treatment of 8-weekly intervals between cuts, the balance between N
   inputs and N taken-up by plants was closest to zero. Especially in those
   cases of low CFs (10 and 12-weekly intervals between cuts), the apparent
   N budget showed that N added with fertilisers was not fully removed from
   the system regarding above-ground biomass yields. Due to high SOCS and
   STNS in both soil layers it can be assumed that N surplus had been
   partly built into the soil organic matter. However, a part of N was
   uncontrollably lost from the soil-plant system. The obtained results
   highlight the complexity of the problem of C sequestration. In reality
   none of the treatments at the end of the experiment displayed
   everything, namely, high SOCS in both layers of the soil, low
   uncontrolled outputs of N from the system, high plant diversity and high
   yields of above-ground plant biomass. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The structure and dynamics of insect community in grasslands can be
   influenced by grazing management via altered characteristics of plant
   community. However, attempts to better understand the complex
   relationships among plants, insects, and large herbivores is still
   hampered largely by the interactive effects of plants, insects, and
   large grazers on each other. In this study, we test the hypothesis that
   the effect of large herbivores on insect abundance is grazer
   species-specific and pre-grazing plant diversity-dependent using an
   experiment with manipulating four grazing treatments (i.e., control,
   cattle, goats, and sheep) at low, intermediate, and high plant diversity
   levels in a meadow steppe at northeast in China. We show that grazing
   significantly increased the abundance of the entire insect community.
   The abundance of each insect order responded differently to grazing
   treatments, with higher abundance of Orthoptera and Homoptera under
   sheep grazing, enhanced abundance of Coleoptera and Diptera under cattle
   grazing, and reduced Hemiptera abundance, but greater abundance of
   Lepidoptera under goats grazing. Thus different treatments profoundly
   changed insect taxonomic composition. The six most dominant species
   (Euchorthippus unicolor, Aelia nasuta, Trigonotylus ruficornis,
   Curculionidae sp., Coccinula quatuordecimpustulata, and Cicadellidae
   sp.) responded differently to grazing by large herbivores, with either
   increased or decreased its abundance. The effects of grazing on insect
   abundance were driven by their differential responsive mechanisms for
   vegetation. More importantly, the effects of grazing on insect abundance
   at both order- and species-levels potentially depended on plant
   diversity levels of pre-grazing. Our results suggest that different
   herbivore species should be used in the background of different plant
   communities for better conservation of insect community in managed

Abstract = {{The negative effect of increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) pollution on
   grassland biodiversity is now incontrovertible(1-3). However, the recent
   introduction of cleaner technologies in the UK has led to reductions in
   the emissions of nitrogen oxides, with concomitant decreases in N
   deposition(4). The degree to which grassland biodiversity can be
   expected to `bounce back' in response to these improvements in air
   quality is uncertain, with a suggestion that long-term chronic N
   addition may lead to an alternative low biodiversity state5. Here we
   present evidence from the 160-year-old Park Grass Experiment at
   Rothamsted Research, UK6, that shows a positive response of biodiversity
   to reducing N addition from either atmospheric pollution or fertilizers.
   The proportion of legumes, species richness and diversity increased
   across the experiment between 1991 and 2012 as both wet and dry N
   deposition declined. Plots that stopped receiving inorganic N fertilizer
   in 1989 recovered much of the diversity that had been lost, especially
   if limed. There was no evidence that chronic N addition has resulted in
   an alternative low biodiversity state on the Park Grass plots, except
   where there has been extreme acidification, although it is likely that
   the recovery of plant communities has been facilitated by the
   twice-yearly mowing and removal of biomass. This may also explain why a
   comparable response of plant communities to reduced N inputs has yet to
   be observed in the wider landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands host large parts of Europe's agricultural arthropod
   diversity. Considering the adverse effects of ongoing land use changes
   on many grassland taxa, there is an urgent need to establish measures
   that allow for optimizing the conservation of permanent grassland
   habitats and their climatic, environmental and ecological benefits.
   Here, data from 42 permanent grasslands were used to quantify the effect
   of individual management practices on different diversity components in
   spider and ground beetle communities. Intensive fertilization and
   frequent cutting reduced the species richness of spiders and the number
   of threatened spider species, but increased the average taxonomic
   distinctness of communities. Moreover, high grazing intensity reduced
   the average body size of individuals in local spider communities.
   Frequent cutting led to a higher abundance of predaceous and omnivorous
   ground beetles but a lower abundance of herbivorous species. These
   opposing responses of both different biodiversity components and
   different taxa to individual grassland management practices confirm that
   no single management practice maximizes the biodiversity of arthropod
   predators in permanent grasslands at the local scale. Rather, our study
   suggests that arthropod predator diversity can only be conserved by
   promoting a landscape-scale combination of different management
   practices and intensities in permanent grasslands. When considering
   conservation measures, conservation goals should not only be formulated
   in terms of local species richness, but also need to address other

Abstract = {{There is growing concern that the global decline of insect pollinators
   will adversely influence the stability of pollination in agricultural
   and terrestrial ecosystems. By enhancing habitat heterogeneity and
   ecological connectivity, riparian buffer strips have the potential to
   promote insect pollinators in intensively managed landscapes. Insect
   pollinators and flowering plants were investigated on a range of
   riparian margins, and their adjacent grassland fields, to determine the
   main physical and botanical attributes driving pollinator diversity.
   Irrespective of whether they were fenced or not, riparian margins had
   richer plant assemblages and supported more pollinators than grassland
   fields. While the erection of fences did not enhance the richness or
   diversity of flowers, fenced riparian buffer strips supported more even
   and diverse assemblages of bumblebees and a greater number of
   butterflies than unfenced riparian margins. More bumblebees and
   butterflies were recorded in wide buffer strips (i.e. over 5 m wide)
   than in unfenced margins or narrow buffer strips (i.e. <= 3.5 m wide)
   and butterfly assemblages in wide buffer strips were richer and more
   diverse. There was a strong positive relationship between floral
   resources and the abundance, richness and diversity of bumblebee and
   butterfly assemblages. Pollinators only foraged on a small number of the
   flower species present and impacts of fencing and buffer strip width
   could not solely be attributed to the area and/or species richness of
   flowers.
   Fenced riparian buffer strips, particularly when over 5 m wide, have the
   potential to provide resources for insect pollinators in intensively
   grazed systems. Management to enhance floristic diversity (to provide a
   more continuous supply of pollen and nectar) and tussock forming grasses
   (to provide shelter for pollinators and nesting locations for
   bumblebees) could further increase their value to insect pollinators. In
   grassland systems, restricted grazing is easier to implement than
   mowing. It is, however, important that grazing management does not
   unduly interfere with other ecosystem services derived from riparian
   buffer strips (e.g. diffuse pollution mitigation). Widespread fencing of
   watercourses at the catchment level could result in the simplification
   of these inherently dynamic and complex habitats. Buffer strips should
   therefore be strategically placed to optimise benefits such as
   ecological connectivity and diffuse pollution mitigation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Efficient conservation management must be applied in protected areas in
   order to slow the loss of biodiversity in Europe. Regarding forests, a
   conservation approach based on minimal intervention prevails in most
   protected woodlands, thus facilitating the expansion of closed-canopy
   forests at the expense of open forests. To identify effective
   conservation strategies for protected forests, the minimal intervention
   or ``hands-off{''} approach must be compared with active measures to
   support biodiversity.
   We carried out a study in the oak-dominated forests of Podyji National
   Park (Czech Republic), an historically managed area left for natural
   succession since 1950. Twelve experimental clearings were created in
   closed-canopy forests within the core zone of the park; six of these
   clearings were connected to forest edges and open meadows, the remaining
   six clearings were isolated from open habitats within closed forest. To
   assess the importance of minimal intervention and active management
   measures in protected forests, we compared the richness and composition
   of insects, reptiles, birds and vascular plants in the clearings and in
   four reference habitats, including closed forest, forest edge, open
   forest, and meadow, in the first season following the intervention.
   In comparison to closed-canopy forest, the clearings had higher species
   richness of butterflies, saproxylic and floricolous beetles, reptiles,
   and vascular plants but lower richness of moths and epigeic beetles, and
   similar richness of birds. For most groups, the species composition of
   clearings differed from that of closed forest or even the forest edge,
   indicating that the latter habitats cannot serve as a sufficient
   replacements for the conservation of open woodland species. The species
   richness of isolated clearings was generally lower than that of
   clearings connected to open habitats, and their communities contained a
   larger proportion of species associated with closed forest. Most
   threatened species were associated with clearings or open forest, closed
   forest and meadow hosted only a few.
   The creation of the clearings in closed-canopy forests had a positive

Abstract = {{Human beings manage ecosystems to obtain ecosystem services. Through
   selected interventions they modify ecosystem condition to increase the
   provisioning services of interest to people. We analyzed the effect of
   livestock management regime components (duration, grazing period, number
   of burns and slashes and stocking density) on ecosystem services
   (provisioning, regulating and supporting) in seeded pastures in a
   tropical dry region. Our main questions were: (1) How is livestock
   management duration related to the magnitude of service supply?: (2) How
   are the different components of the livestock management regime and site
   conditions related to the magnitude of ecosystem service supply?: and
   (3) How do the components of management regime, the site conditions and
   the magnitude of ecosystem service supply interact? We quantified 15
   service indicators within 24 plots (20 x 50 m) chosen along a 40-year
   gradient of livestock management duration. Livestock management regime
   was documented with semi-structured interviews to landowners. Simple
   linear regressions showed that increasing livestock management duration
   was related to increasing forage amount (p = 0.03) and to decreasing
   forage quality (p = 0.05), soil structure (p = 0.002), and several
   biodiversity indicators (p = 0.002-0.03). Stepwise multiple regression
   analyses showed that the increase in the total number of burns was
   related to decreases in foliar and soil nitrogen (p < 0.05), carbon
   stock (p < 0.001), as well as woody, herbaceous, and seedling richness
   or evenness (p < 0.001). Increased frequency of slashes and of the
   grazing period also decreased soil fertility regulation and
   biodiversity. The canonical correspondence analysis showed a prominent
   role of the number of burns (which is correlated with duration, slashing
   frequency and grazing period) in promoting forage production, but in
   reducing most indicators of regulating and supporting services.
   Increased shallow soil moisture was related to increasing regulating and
   supporting services. Canopy covers inside the plot and in the
   surrounding forest were positively related to woody and seedling
   richness or evenness, but were independent of the effects of other
   management regime components. Our study suggests a conflict between the
   short-term management decisions such as burning to foster forage
   production and the long term sustainability of the management regime of
   these seeded pastures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Positive and negative plant-plant interactions generally co-occur in
   communities but their relative importance should depend on site
   productivity; the importance of facilitation is expected to increase and
   that of competition to decrease with the adversity of the environment.
   Moreover the effect of surrounding vegetation on an individual's
   performance can vary depending on the individual's life stage and on the
   variables used to characterize an individual's performance. To test
   these theories, we established a transplant experiment in a wet meadow
   in order to assess the effects of surrounding vegetation on individual
   plants under varying environmental conditions and changes in these
   effects during an individual's development within one growing season. We
   asked whether (i) the net effects of plant interactions differ with
   differences in productivity and disturbance, and (ii) the net effects of
   interactions differ according to life stage, species and the performance
   measure used. We utilized a long-term experiment with three treatments
   (application of fertilizer, mowing and removal of the dominant species)
   in a full factorial design, yielding eight combinations, with three
   replicate plots per combination. In each plot four individuals of three
   species (Lysimachia vulgaris, Prunella vulgaris and Plantago lanceolata)
   were transplanted, two into gaps and two into intact vegetation.
   Survival (alive/dead) of each individual was recorded twice during the
   season. The presence of flowers and above- and below-ground biomass were
   recorded at the end of the transplant experiment. The survival of
   transplants early in the season was higher when growing among
   vegetation, indicating that at an early stage in its life the net effect
   of the surrounding vegetation was positive. At later stages, competition
   became more important and had a negative effect on biomass production
   and plant reproduction. This negative effect was more pronounced in
   fertilized plots while the effect of mowing and removal of dominant
   species on plant interactions was generally negligible. Our results
   indicate, particularly under more productive conditions, the importance
   of changes in the net outcome of plant interactions during different
   life stages, highlighting the dynamic nature of positive and negative

Abstract = {{When grassland degradation became a global issue because of overgrazing
   and other human activities, grassland managers implemented different
   management methods in an attempt to restore grassland ecosystems (e.g.
   conservation actions). Few studies have investigated the impacts of
   conservation actions (removing large grazers and conserving
   biodiversity) on grassland ecosystems, therefore, this study aims to
   evaluate the impacts of conservation actions and to measure the time lag
   of the significant influences of grassland conservations on mixed
   grasslands that were assessed by five different biophysical parameters
   (biodiversity, soil organic matter, fresh biomass, litter cover and
   green cover). Instead of measuring the biophysical parameters from field
   data and remotely sensed images, the methodology of this study focused
   on the difference in biophysical parameters between the ecological
   comparison sites (grazing sites and conserved sites), which enhance the
   impacts of grassland conservation on grasslands comparing to grazing
   management. The results show that: (i) biodiversity in conserved
   grasslands increased gradually in the first 3-5 years, decreased
   gradually over the next 4 or 5 years, and then stabilized after that;
   (ii) soil organic matter increased and reached its maximum value within
   7-9 years of conservation and then remained at this level, while litter
   accumulated the maximum level one year later than soil organic matter;
   (iii) soil organic matter is the primary factor of biodiversity in the
   grasslands with low litter accumulation, while high-density litter
   layers are the primary cause of decreases in biodiversity; (iv) fresh
   biomass decreased over a period of 7-10 years under conservation and
   remained nearly unchanged after that; (v) green vegetation fraction was
   also increased by conservation action in about 6-7 years. The result of
   this study provides the fundamental information for implementing and
   adjusting grassland management policies.}},

   grassland sites with high grazing intensity, while the abundance of
   legumes, including L. corniculatus, forbs and woody species, increased

Abstract = {{The break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991 led to the abandonment of >40
   million ha of cropland, a collapse in livestock numbers and the recovery
   of depleted biodiversity on the steppe grasslands of Kazakhstan and
   southern Russia. More recently, large-scale reclamation of abandoned
   cropland and intensification of agriculture are observed, highlighting a
   need for strategies to reconcile agricultural development and
   biodiversity. We related bird densities along a land-use gradient to
   yield estimates from arable and livestock systems in central Kazakhstan
   to decide whether a land-sparing, a land-sharing or an intermediate
   strategy would result in the largest benefits for biodiversity. For
   loser species' (whose population size is reduced by farming), land
   sparing was predicted to support higher total populations of more
   species than was land sharing, at all production targets. Winners'
   (species benefitting from agriculture) profited from land sharing when
   judged from food energy or protein. Intermediate yields were best for
   very few species. Heavily grazed steppe grassland was important for
   several globally threatened and biome-restricted species. Government
   statistics suggested that over 50\% of abandoned cropland has been
   reclaimed since 2000 and crop yields have increased. In the same period,
   there was significant progress towards the designation of new protected
   areas, but the total area in Kazakhstan still falls short of the
   Convention on Biological Diversity's 17\% target.Policy implications.
   Further increases in agricultural production are likely to reduce
   populations of most birds, especially if they are achieved by conversion
   of abandoned cropland, or grassland. Our results suggest that production
   increases would do least harm if they resulted from increasing the
   output of existing cropland, using approaches such as snow accumulation,
   no-till and more efficient grain harvesting and storage, rather than
   from further reclamation of abandoned land that is now reverting back to
   steppe. Production increases should be offset by improved conservation
   planning through the designation of protected areas on land potentially
   suitable for cropland expansion.}},

Abstract = {{Land abandonment is pervasive in mountainous Europe. In the present
   situation of price-cost squeeze on pastoral households and general shift
   in the role of farming, the development of farming abandonment risk
   regions is generally associated with adoption of new multifunctional
   rural development strategies, such as farm tourism, which in the end
   entail less time being devoted to farming practices. We explored the
   effects of such developmental scheme on the preservation of semi-natural
   grasslands, in particular, and on the sustainability of mountain
   pastoralism, in general. While the effects on the preservation of
   semi-natural grasslands of full abandonment have been extensively
   explored, this is not the case of partial abandonment. Results showed
   that the adoption of simplified and low-cost management regimes,
   associated with partial abandonment and the increased adoption of
   part-time farming, immerses semi-natural grasslands in processes of
   secondary succession that undermine both their conservation and pastoral
   functions. This points the need for caution when endorsing
   multifunctional developmental schemes in farming abandonment risk
   regions, particularly when those imply less labor being devoted to
   pastoral practices. In conclusion, we stress that in farming abandonment
   risk regions it is possible to guarantee both viable pastoralism and
   diversified rural economy. However, it is necessary to implement
   developmental strategies that are centered on stimulating synergies
   between pastoralism and other economic activities, rather than promoting
   activities that depend on additional farmers' polyvalence.}},

Abstract = {{True restoration of highly disrupted native ecosystems is universally
   difficult, and has not been achieved on waste rock dumps at a rock
   phosphate mine in the resource-limited rangeland environment of semiarid
   Queensland, Australia. Thirteen years after rehabilitation, there is
   general correspondence, but some temporal variation, in tree and shrub
   species richness between rehabilitated and analogue native vegetation
   sites. Large differences in the composition and extent of ground cover
   vegetation were associated with dominance of most sites by an introduced
   perennial pasture grass species and by periodic drought. Complete
   reinstatement of native ecosystems is shown to be inconsistent with the
   physical constraints of waste rock dumps, the erratic climate, the
   previous history of extensive grazing and a lack of effective
   rehabilitation planning. Revised goals of strict landscape stability and
   broad biodiversity attributes, based on those of relevant native
   ecosystem analogues, are proposed to enable the identification of
   appropriate native and novel ecosystem targets for the modified
   landscapes. Novel ecosystems combining tree and shrub components of the
   native vegetation, and ground cover (including introduced grasses) could
   provide the most effective targets for mined land rehabilitation in a
   semi-arid environment. Principles are suggested for the selection of
   vegetation targets for the rehabilitation of mine waste rock dumps,
   considering the new lithologies and landforms and the occurrence of a
   dominant introduced grass species. These principles should be applicable
   widely, but especially in resource-limited environments. (C) 2015

   affected seven components directly, and one more indirectly. Four of
   these impacts were negative and four were positive. Of the 20
   traditional management elements in Ars,g, 11 elements were regulated,
   and five more were affected indirectly. Only two elements were affected
   positively. Our data show that for a more efficient support of
   traditional farming, more traditional elements must be encouraged, e.g.
   hayseed scattering, mowing with small machinery, manual cleaning of
   weeds and shrubs, manual hay gathering and extensive manuring. The role
   of increasing the spatial scale of regulations, considering the whole
   socio-ecological system and the need for region-specific regulations are
   discussed. We argue that in those landscapes where traditional
   small-scale farming is still actively practiced, decision-makers should
   understand local management practices and concepts first, instead of
   imposing requirements on farmers that are alien to the local landscape
   and society.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the consequences of trophic interactions for ecosystem

   experimentally manipulated functional identity and diversity of

   and the diversity of mandibular traits, had more important effects on
   plant biomass than body size. Higher herbivore functional diversity
   increased overall impact on plant biomass due to feeding niche
   complementarity. Higher plant functional diversity limited biomass
   pre-emption by herbivores. The functional diversity within and across
   trophic levels therefore regulates the impact of functionally
   contrasting consumers on primary producers. By experimentally
   manipulating the functional diversity across trophic levels, our study
   illustrates how trait-based approaches constitute a promising way to

Abstract = {{The highly specialized flora of localities affected by former metal ore
   mining and metallurgy is endangered by succession or intentional
   afforestation all over Europe. Its last remnants therefore deserve our
   attention. We examined whether Scots pine encroaching on a heavy-metal
   grassland (Olkusz Zn-Pb mining area, S Poland) is outcompeting
   specialized herbaceous species, as has been observed elsewhere. Plant
   species composition and richness sampled at 124 plots were analysed in
   relation to pine stand parameters (canopy cover, stand age, stand basal
   area), abiotic environmental factors (e.g. soil properties) and spatial
   variables (e.g. plot coordinates). Plots were divided into three shading
   categories and compared in terms of vegetation and habitat parameters.
   Scots pine outcompeted several light-demanding species, leading to a
   decrease of total species richness and cover. Characteristic species of
   this grassland (Biscutella laevigata, Silene vulgaris) and some
   metal-tolerant plants were clearly insensitive to shading. For these
   early successional species, more important was the availability of
   microsites with shallow skeletal soil or bare subsoil. Tree stand
   parameters differently affected grassland vegetation: canopy cover
   caused primarily a compositional shift in the community, while stand age
   was the principal agent of decline in species richness. Scots pine
   increased the soil concentrations of available Ca and Mg, and negatively
   affected soil development (organic matter and mineral particle
   accumulation), which might be beneficial to some shade-tolerant
   grassland species. Maintaining the studied grassland's present species
   richness and composition would require cutting woody plants less
   frequently than recommended for dry grasslands of non-metalliferous
   sites, and disturbing the soil surface.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity is rapidly declining globally. One strategy to help to
   conserve species is to breed species in captivity and release them into
   suitable habitats. The way that reintroduced animals explore new
   habitats and/or disperse from the release site is rarely studied in
   detail and represents key information for the success of reintroduction
   projects. The European bison (Bison bonasus L. 1758) was the largest
   surviving herbivore of the post-glacial mega-fauna in Europe before it
   became extinct in the wild, surviving only in captivity since 1919. We
   investigated the exploration behavior of a herd of European bison
   reintroduced into the Rothaargebirge, a commercial forest in low range
   mountain intensively used and densely populated by humans, in the first
   six months after release. We focused on three questions: (1) how did the
   European bison move and utilize the habitat on a daily basis, (2) how
   did the animals explore the new environment, and (3) did their habitat
   preferences change over time. The European bison dispersed away from
   their previous enclosure at an average rate of 539 m/month, with their
   areas of daily use ranging from 70 to 173 ha, their movement ranging
   from 3.6 km to 5.2 km per day, and their day-to-day use of areas ranged
   between 389 and 900 m. We could identify three major exploration bouts,
   when the animals entered and explored areas previously unknown to them.
   During the birthing phase, the European bison reduced daily walking
   distances, and the adult bull segregated from the herd for 58 days.
   Around rut, roaming behavior of the herd increased slightly. The animals
   preferred spruce forest, wind thrown areas and grassland, all of which
   are food abundant habitat types, and they avoided beech forest. Habitat
   preference differed slightly between phases of the study period,
   probably due to phenological cycles. After six months, the complete
   summer home range was 42.5 km(2). Our study shows that a small
   free-ranging herd of European bison can live in an area intensively used
   by humans and describes in detail the initial roaming behavior and
   habitat utilization of the animals.}},

Abstract = {{Rising temperatures due to climate change are pushing the thermal limits
   of many species, but how climate warming interacts with other
   anthropogenic disturbances such as land use remains poorly understood.
   To understand the interactive effects of climate warming and livestock
   grazing on water temperature in three high elevation meadow streams in
   the Golden Trout Wilderness, California, we measured riparian vegetation
   and monitored water temperature in three meadow streams between 2008 and
   2013, including two ``resting{''} meadows and one meadow that is
   partially grazed. All three meadows have been subject to grazing by
   cattle and sheep since the 1800s and their streams are home to the
   imperiled California golden trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss aguabonita). In
   1991, a livestock exclosure was constructed in one of the meadows
   (Mulkey), leaving a portion of stream ungrazed to minimize the negative
   effects of cattle. In 2001, cattle were removed completely from two
   other meadows (Big Whitney and Ramshaw), which have been in a
   ``resting{''} state since that time. Inside the livestock exclosure in
   Mulkey, we found that riverbank vegetation was both larger and denser
   than outside the exclosure where cattle were present, resulting in more
   shaded waters and cooler maximal temperatures inside the exclosure. In
   addition, between meadows comparisons showed that water temperatures
   were cooler in the ungrazed meadows compared to the grazed area in the
   partially grazed meadow. Finally, we found that predicted temperatures
   under different global warming scenarios were likely to be higher in
   presence of livestock grazing. Our results highlight that land use can
   interact with climate change to worsen the local thermal conditions for
   taxa on the edge and that protecting riparian vegetation is likely to
   increase the resiliency of these ecosystems to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Pollinators are declining globally, and this decline in ecosystem
   services threatens the stability of agricultural and natural systems.
   Pollinators depend on a diversity of floral resources that are primarily
   found in uncultivated areas of agro-ecosystems such as grasslands.
   Seasonal succession (the seasonal changes that occur in community
   composition and structure) of floral resources is an essential
   consideration for pollinator conservation within agro-ecosystems.
   Different types of grasslands common within agricultural landscapes
   could be expected to differ in their seasonal succession of floral
   resources. Here we investigated how different types of grasslands
   important for pollinator conservation in the tallgrass prairie ecoregion
   (remnant prairies, reconstructed prairies, conservation grazed cattle
   pastures, and old fields) differ in their seasonal succession of floral
   resources by sampling the plant community every two weeks from 3 May
   through 4 October 2013. We found remnant prairies had greater richness
   of inflorescences when summed over the growing season, and that remnants
   were least similar to the other grassland types in terms of composition.
   Reconstructed prairies had high richness of inflorescences and exhibited
   the most similarity in composition to remnant prairies only during the
   middle of the growing season. Conservation grazed cattle pastures had
   more periods where turnover in composition from one survey to the next
   was low, indicated by the coefficient of variation in turnover
   throughout the season. Old fields had the lowest richness of
   inflorescences and were significantly different from reconstructed and
   remnant prairies.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{71-77}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Butterfly conservation in Europe is mainly focused on well-defined
   grassland habitat patches. Such an approach ignores the impact of the
   surrounding landscape, which may contain complementary resources and
   facilitate dispersal. Here, we investigated butterfly species richness
   and abundance in a habitat normally regarded as unsuitable matrix:
   production forestry clear-cuts. Butterflies were recorded in 48
   clear-cuts in southern Sweden differing with regards to the time since
   clear-cutting and land-use history (meadow or forest based on historical
   maps from the 1870s). All clear-cuts had been managed as production
   forests for at least 80-120 years. A total of 39 species were found in
   clear-cuts of both land-use histories, but clear-cuts with a history as
   meadow had on average 34\% higher species richness and 19\% higher
   abundance than did clear-cuts with a history as forest. No effect of the
   time since clear-cutting was found, irrespective of land-use history,
   which was likely due to the narrow timespan sampled (<8 years). The
   absence of temporal effect suggests that clear-cuts may provide
   butterflies with valuable resources for 10-15 years. Assuming a 100 year
   forest rotational cycle, this means that 10-15\% of the total forested
   area are made up by clear-cuts valuable to butterflies, which
   corresponds to an area about four times as large as that of species-rich
   semi-natural grasslands. The study illustrates the importance of
   considering land-use legacies in ecological research and question the
   landscape-ecological view that clear-cuts make up an unsuitable matrix
   for butterflies. Moreover, forest conservation management with special
   attention to land-use history may increase the quality of the landscape,
   thus facilitating butterfly metapopulation persistence. Given their
   large area and assets of nectar and host plant resources, clear-cuts
   must be considered as a butterfly habitat in its own right. Being a
   man-made environment with short history, we might call it a neo-habitat.

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{191}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A vast majority of European farmers are dependent on EU subsidies, which
   makes subsidy regulations through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
   powerful tools in shaping agricultural landscapes. Unfortunately,
   steering recommendations are sometimes arbitrary, like in the case of
   pasture management, where 50 trees per hectare constitute an upper limit
   to qualify for subsidies. Although pasture biodiversity is well studied
   and the core of many CAP conservation programmes, it is seldom studied
   as direct effects of subsidy systems. In this paper, we examine plant
   diversity in relation to the impact of subsidy systems in Swedish woody
   pastures along a gradient from 3 to 214 trees per hectare. We selected
   64 sites where we recorded vascular plants, soil properties and canopy
   cover. We found a general increase in gamma- and beta-diversity along
   the gradient, whereas alpha-diversity and the number of grassland
   specialists remained indifferent along the gradient. Additionally, tree
   density, organic content and CN-ratio were the strongest predictors of
   species composition. Hence, when CAP regulations encourage tree cutting
   for pastures to qualify for subsidies there is risk of homogenisation of
   EU grasslands, leading to decreased and gamma- and beta-diversity. If a
   general target for the subsidies is to increase biodiversity, there is
   need to scrutinise these regulation details to preserve the high values
   of woody pastures. We argue that habitat variation, species diversity
   and low intensity management, rather than a specific number of trees,
   should be the main incentives for financial support to preserve
   biodiversity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Riparia surrounding low-order streams are dynamic environments that
   often support distinct biodiversity. Because of their connection to
   nearby uplands, riparian vegetation communities at these streams respond
   to many environmental filtersclimatic, physical, chemical or biotic
   factorsthat restrict what species can occur at a given location from
   within larger regional species pools. In this study, we examined how
   environmental filters originating at the landscape, watershed and reach
   scales correspond to riparian plant community composition across the
   interior Columbia and upper Missouri River basins, USA. We correlated
   riparian vegetation to environmental filters, identified unique
   communities and partitioned the variance within riparian vegetation data
   among filters originating at different scales. Riparian vegetation
   composition was strongly correlated to landscape-scale filters including
   elevation, precipitation and temperature. Watershed-scale filters such
   as grazing and reach filters indicative of fluvial setting were also
   correlated to vegetation composition, often differentiating communities
   with similar landscape settings. We identified 10 distinct vegetation
   communities. Forested communities occurred at higher elevation, moderate
   gradient reaches with high mean annual precipitation. Shrub-forb systems
   corresponded to fluvial and watershed disturbances and occurred within
   climates that could preclude forest establishment. Meadows corresponded
   to high water tables and/or high grazing activity. Variance partitioning
   showed that landscape-scale filters explained the most variance within
   vegetation communities. Global change will alter many of the
   environmental filters that drive vegetation. Vegetation change may occur
   rapidly if local filters (e.g. fluvial process) change rapidly or may
   occur more slowly if larger-order filters (e.g. climate) change slowly
   and without influencing local hydrogeomorphic filters. By identifying
   filter-vegetation relationships at large spatial scales, hypotheses can
   be constructed on how riparian vegetation communities may change under
   future environmental conditions. Published 2014. This article is a U.S.

Abstract = {{A need to increase agricultural production across the world to ensure
   continued food security appears to be at odds with the urgency to reduce
   the negative environmental impacts of intensive agriculture. Around the
   world, intensification has been associated with massive simplification
   and uniformity at all levels of organization, i.e., field, farm,
   landscape, and region. Therefore, we postulate that negative
   environmental impacts of modern agriculture are due more to production
   simplification than to inherent characteristics of agricultural
   productivity. Thus by enhancing diversity within agricultural systems,
   it should be possible to reconcile high quantity and quality of food
   production with environmental quality. Intensification of livestock and
   cropping systems separately within different specialized regions
   inevitably leads to unacceptable environmental impacts because of the
   overly uniform land use system in intensive cereal areas and excessive
   N-P loads in intensive animal areas. The capacity of grassland
   ecosystems to couple C and N cycles through microbial-soil-plant
   interactions as a way for mitigating the environmental impacts of
   intensive arable cropping system was analyzed in different management
   options: grazing, cutting, and ley duration, in order to minimize
   trade-offs between production and the environment. We suggest that
   integrated crop-livestock systems are an appropriate strategy to enhance
   diversity. Sod-based rotations can temporally and spatially capture the
   benefits of leys for minimizing environmental impacts, while still
   maintaining periods and areas of intensive cropping. Long-term
   experimental results illustrate the potential of such systems to
   sequester C in soil and to reduce and control N emissions to the
   atmosphere and hydrosphere.}},

Abstract = {{The proportion of beef cattle in relation to the total number of cattle
   has increased in Europe, which has led to a higher contribution of beef
   cattle in the management of semi-natural grasslands. Changes in
   vegetation caused by this change in grazers are virtually unexplored so
   far. In the present study, the impacts of beef and dairy cattle on
   vegetation structure and composition were compared on Bothnian Bay
   coastal meadows. Vegetation parameters were measured in seven beef
   cattle, six dairy heifer pastures, and in six unmanaged meadows.
   Compared to unmanaged meadows, vegetation in grazed meadows was
   significantly lower in height and more frequently colonized by
   low-growth species. As expected, vegetation grazed by beef cattle was
   more open than that on dairy heifer pastures where litter cover and
   proportion of bare ground were in the same level as in the unmanaged
   meadows. However, the observed differences may have in part arisen from
   the higher cattle densities in coastal meadows grazed by beef cattle
   than by dairy heifers. The frequencies of different species groups and
   the species richness values of vegetation did not differ between the
   coastal meadows grazed by the two cattle types. One reason for this may
   be the relatively short management history of the studied pastures. The
   potential differences in grazing impacts of the two cattle types on
   vegetation structure can be utilized in the management of coastal
   meadows for species with divergent habitat requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Protected areas of Romania have enjoyed particular importance after
   1989, but, at the same time, they were subject to different
   anthropogenic and natural pressures which resulted in the occurrence of
   land cover changes. These changes have generally led to landscape
   degradation inside and at the borders of the protected areas. In this
   article, 12 landscape metrics were used in order to quantify landscape
   pattern and assess land cover changes in two protected areas, Piatra
   Craiului National Park (PCNP) and Bucegi Natural Park (BNP). The
   landscape metrics were obtained from land cover maps derived from
   Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
   (ETM+) images from 1987, 1993, 2000, 2009 and 2010. Three land cover
   classes were analysed in PCNP and five land cover map classes in BNP.
   The results show a landscape fragmentation trend for both parks,
   affecting different types of land covers. Between 1987 and 2010, in PCNP
   fragmentation was, in principle, the result not only of anthropogenic
   activities such as forest cuttings and illegal logging but also of
   natural causes. In BNP, between 1987 and 2009, the fragmentation
   affected the pasture which resulted in the occurrence of bare land and
   rocky areas because of the erosion on the Bucegi Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{Rangeland rehabilitation has multiple, sometimes conflicting goals, such
   as the reestablishment of the predisturbance vegetation, soil
   protection, and forage production. The rehabilitation techniques should
   be also cost-effective and practicable. Given the difficulties and high
   costs of restoring Succulent Karoo rangelands and the continuously high
   grazing pressure in the communal lands, tradeoffs should be accepted in
   the achievement of these goals. We tested the capability of paddock
   manure redistribution to reverse degradation trends in a heavily grazed
   Succulent Karoo rangeland in South Africa. Over 3years, the effects of
   the manure application were compared with areas planted with mature
   shrubs as a benchmark for a predisturbance vegetation structure and with
   four popular rehabilitation techniques: (1) livestock exclusion; (2)
   brushpacking (coverage of dead shrubs); (3) mineral fertilizing; and (4)
   microcatchment construction. Manure was, besides planting, the only
   treatment that resulted in a significant increase in drought-resistant
   vegetation cover, but it compromised the dominance of native vegetation.
   In the manure plots, a pasture-like vegetation of non-native forage
   plants (which germinated mainly from seeds in the dung), developed
   (foremost Atriplex semibaccata). Manure application counteracted erosion
   as effectively as the planted shrubs and brushpacks. Expected negative
   side effects such as a decrease in plant species richness or
   salinization of topsoil were not detected. We also checked the potential
   of topsoil salinization by the halophytic A. semibaccata and found it to
   be low. For sites where a decrease in grazing pressure is unrealistic
   under current land tenure, redistribution of manure should be further
   explored to mitigate acute symptoms of degradation. Copyright (c) 2013

Abstract = {{Conversion of native forest to pastures is a common practice worldwide;
   it has complex effects on river biota that are related to activity type
   and intensity. This work was conducted in order to evaluate the effects
   of cattle grazing on environmental features and to select the most
   appropriate measures based on the macroinvertebrate community as
   indicators of ecological changes. Physicochemical features, riparian
   ecosystem quality, habitat condition, and benthic macroinvertebrates
   were investigated in streams draining pastures and were compared to
   reference streams located in nonimpacted native forested catchments.
   Strong evidence of sediment deposition was observed at pasture streams,
   which had higher percentage of sand in the streambed but also increased
   levels of suspended solids. Pasture sites had significantly higher water
   temperature and conductivity as well as lower dissolved oxygen
   concentrations than did forested sites. Both riparian quality and
   in-stream habitat condition were degraded at pasture sites. Among
   metrics, total richness, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, and Trichoptera
   (EPT) richness, Plecoptera richness, Shannon diversity, percentage of
   dominant taxon, percentage of Chironomidae species, shredder richness,
   and percentage of predator resulted to be the most consistent measures
   by displaying stronger responses to impairment. Our results suggest that
   forest conversion to pasture for livestock practices is diminishing
   macroinvertebrate biodiversity and potentially changing functioning and
   dynamics of Patagonian mountain streams as well. Damage prevention on
   riverine landscapes by restoring riparian ecosystems, replanting missing
   vegetation in buffer areas, and limiting livestock access to the
   riverbanks could contribute to enhance the ecological integrity at
   converted areas. A more extended and comprehensive use of
   macroinvertebrate metrics could contribute to better understand and
   evaluate impact effects of these extended land use activities and to
   promote conservation strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic influences on resources and consumers can affect food web
   regulation, with impacts on trophic structure and ecosystem processes.
   Identifying how these impacts unfold is challenging because alterations
   to one or both resources and consumers can similarly transform community
   structure, especially for intermediate consumers. To date, empirical
   testing of perturbations on trophic regulation has been limited by the
   difficulty in separating the direct effect of perturbations on species
   composition and diversity from those unfolding indirectly via altered
   feeding pathways. Moreover, disentangling the independent and
   interactive impacts of co-varying stressors that characterize
   human-altered systems has been an ongoing analytical challenge. We used
   a large-scale metacommunity experiment in grasslands to test how
   resource inputs, stand perturbation, and spatial factors affect
   regulation of insect herbivores in tritrophic grassland food webs. Using
   path-model comparisons, we observed significant simplification of food
   web regulation on insect herbivores, shifting from mixed
   predator-resource regulation in un-altered mainland areas to strictly
   resource-based regulation with landscape perturbation and fragmentation.
   Most changes were attributed to homogenization of plant community caused
   by landscape fragmentation and the deterministic influence of
   eutrophication that reduced among-patch beta diversity. This led to a
   simplified food web dominated by fewer but more abundant herbivore taxa.
   Our work implies that anthropogenic perturbation relating to resources

Abstract = {{Understanding the effects of herbivores on plant communities is needed
   for anticipating how variation in grazing regimes will impact natural
   and semi-natural ecosystems. Prominent ecological hypotheses predict
   that drastic reductions of herbivory, as have occurred in many European
   mountains, will trigger fast diversity loss and structural changes in
   grasslands, because grazing tolerant species are expected to be rapidly
   replaced by taller and more competitive species. The aims of this study
   were to test generalizations of herbivory effects (mostly from lowlands)
   in high elevation grasslands over ecological relevant times scales, and
   to unravel the contribution of climatic conditions to observed changes.
   Species richness, canopy height, plant community structure, and
   transition probabilities among ecological groups were monitored
   throughout 19 years in herbivore exclusions and control plots in the
   Central Pyrenees. We used ordination analyses to track the long-term
   community response to herbivore exclusion, and generalized additive
   models to assess the non-linear effects of herbivore exclusion and
   climatic conditions on measured variables. Contrary to expectations,
   herbivore exclusion did not significantly affect species richness, and
   although canopy height increased, it was not drastic enough to suppress
   shade intolerant species. The strongest shifts in plant community
   structure and transition probabilities between ecological groups
   occurred during a sequence of warm and dry growing seasons, whereas in
   control plots, these changes were smaller, and largely reversed after
   cooler and wetter climatic conditions returned. Our results suggest that
   long-term effects of grazing cessation in high elevation grasslands can
   be weaker and slower than predicted. However, these effects can act
   synergistically with dry and warm events. Therefore, the maintenance of
   past grazing activities can be key in the face of ongoing climatic
   warming.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological intensification in grasslands can be regarded as a process
   for increasing forage production while maintaining high levels of

   where dairy cattle farming is the main component of agriculture, how to
   achieve forage autonomy at farm level while sustaining environmental
   quality for tourism and local dairy products has recently stimulated
   local debate. As specific management is one of the main drivers of
   ecosystem functioning, we assessed the response of forage production and
   environmental quality at grassland scale across a wide range of
   management practices. We aimed to determine which components of
   management can be harnessed to better match forage production and
   environmental quality. We sampled the vegetation of 51 grasslands
   stratified across 13 grassland types. We assessed each grassland for
   agronomic and environmental properties, measuring forage production,
   forage quality, and indices based on the abundance of particular plant
   species such as timing flexibility, apiarian potential, and aromatic
   plants. Our results revealed an expected trade-off between forage
   production and environmental quality, notably by stressing the contrasts
   between sown and permanent grasslands. However, strong within-type
   variability in both production and environmental quality as well as in
   flexibility of timing of use suggests possible ways to improve this
   trade-off at grassland and farm scales. As achieving forage autonomy
   relies on increasing both forage production and grassland resilience,
   our results highlight the critical role of the ratio between sown and

Abstract = {{The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is
   a central topic in ecology on local, regional, and global scales. A
   powerful approach to BEF studies is large-scale field manipulative

   The Inner Mongolian Grassland Removal Experiment (IMGRE) was designed to
   examine the mechanisms of the BEF relationship in the world's largest
   grassland, explicitly considering multiple trophic levels and grazing by
   grasshoppers and sheep.
   IMGRE followed a randomized block design, with a total of 512 plots (6 m
   x 6 m each). The project involved massive field campaigns and laboratory
   analyses, and unprecedentedly employed two removal protocols in
   parallel: complete removal (eradicating all targeted functional types)
   and partial removal (an equal-disturbance removal scheme).
   We summarize key findings on aboveground and belowground primary
   production, functional richness, identity, and composition, compensation
   at the species, PFT, and community levels, soil water and N retention,
   net N mineralization, microbial biomass, and grazing by grasshoppers and

Abstract = {{Many studies have examined how intensity of grazing and patterns of
   precipitation individually and interactively influence the spatial and
   temporal dynamics of grassland vegetation, such as dominance,
   succession, coexistence, and spatial heterogeneity. However existing
   models have rarely considered the diet preferences of grazers and how
   they interact with variation in precipitation amount and timing.
   We examined how plant community structure responds to the individual and
   combined effects of grazing intensity, selective grazing, and patterns
   of precipitation, based on a six-year grazing experiment with seven
   levels of field-manipulated grazing intensity in a typical steppe of
   Inner Mongolia.
   The palatable species, mainly forbs, were most severely damaged at
   intermediate levels of grazing intensity; given that these species are
   the major contributors to plant community diversity, a U-shaped
   diversity-grazing intensity relationship resulted. In contrast, spatial
   heterogeneity of aboveground biomass and species composition peaked at
   intermediate levels of grazing intensity. Cold season precipitation
   positively correlated with the abundance of the dominant C-3 grasses and
   correlated negatively with the subdominant forbs and C-4 plants. Thus,
   when cold season precipitation increased, plant community species
   diversity decreased. Grazing intensity and precipitation did not
   interact in their effects on species richness.
   These findings contrast with the predictions from current
   disturbance-diversity models and indicate that diet selection of grazing
   animals is an important factor shaping the diversity-grazing intensity
   relationship in semi-arid grasslands. Future grassland biodiversity
   conservation and management practices should take diet preference of
   grazing animals into account.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient enrichment of native grasslands can promote invasion by exotic
   plant species, leading to reduced biodiversity and altered ecosystem
   function. Empirical evidence suggests that positive feedbacks may make
   such transitions difficult to reverse. We developed a mathematical model
   of grassland dynamics in which one group of species (native) is a better
   competitor for nitrogen (N) and another group (exotic) is a better
   competitor for light. We parameterized the model for a grassland
   community and reproduced observed transitions from a native- to an
   exotic-dominated state under N loading. Within known bounds of parameter
   values, both smooth and hysteretic transitions are plausible. The model
   also predicts that N loading alone is insufficient to achieve a
   transition to an exotic-dominated state on a timescale relevant to
   grassland management (a few decades), and that therefore some other
   disturbance (e.g., fire suppression or heaving grazing) must be present
   to accelerate it. The model predicts that to restore a grassland to a
   native-dominated state after N inputs have been reduced, fire and carbon
   supplements would be most effective. Further field research in
   N-enriched invaded grasslands is required to establish the strengths of
   positive feedbacks and, in turn, the consequences of anthropogenic
   modification of grasslands worldwide.}},

Title = {{Impact of grazing abandonment on plant and soil microbial communities in
   an Atlantic mountain grassland}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{251-260}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Livestock grazing is a global land-use activity with multiple social,
   cultural, and environmental impacts. However, it is expected to decrease
   progressively in the Cantabrian Mountain areas as notable changes in
   livestock management systems have been observed, such as shorter stay in
   mountain, lower stocking rates, and less shepherd control. This study
   aimed to evaluate the effect of grazing abandonment on microbial
   function and diversity through changes promoted in aboveground
   vegetation and soil properties. In 2005, we erected permanent fences
   around two 50 x 50-m plots (excluded plots) in a temperate mountain
   grassland that has historically supported livestock managed by an
   extensive grazing system. A grazed plot was defined around each excluded
   plot. After 5 years, grazing abandonment induced shifts in floristic
   composition, decreased soil compaction at 0-10 cm soil depth, and
   reduced soil temperature in the summer due to a thicker plant layer.
   Consequently, microorganisms reduced soil enzymatic activity and
   microbial biomass, and increased CO2 emissions and metabolic quotient,
   which indicated a lower metabolic efficiency of soil processes in
   excluded plots. These results suggest that soil microbial community
   function was very sensitive to the impacts of livestock grazing
   exclusion. The bacterial community was more diverse compared to the
   fungal community, but no significant difference in bacterial species
   richness was found between excluded and grazed plots. Microbial genetic
   diversity was not directly correlated with aboveground vegetation
   diversity and no clear pattern emerged as a response to grazing
   abandonment, probably because soil microbial diversity depends on site
   attributes that operate at a very fine spatial scale. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Grasshoppers are a dominant herbivore assemblage globally and play an
   important role for ecosystem nutrient cycling. Yet, we lack a strong
   understanding of the relationship between grasshopper diversity and
   plant community composition at the landscape scale.
   Our aim was to test landscape scale relationships between plant and
   grasshopper communities.
   We used a large-scale, replicated experiment at four sites, including
   grazed and protected pastures across a 350 km transect and 200-400 mm
   precipitation gradient in the steppes of Inner Mongolia, China. We
   analyzed the relationships between plant and grasshopper parameters with
   ANOVAs and CCA.
   We collected 17 grasshopper species and 15,000+ individuals. The desert
   steppe (lowest precipitation) had the lowest grasshopper richness and
   diversity, but abundance was not different from the other sites. In two
   dry sites (desert steppe and Stipa steppe), livestock grazing decreased
   grasshopper diversity and increased abundance of the main pest species.
   In contrast, at the highest precipitation site (meadow steppe),
   grasshopper communities did not differ between grazing levels. Across
   all sites and grazing intensities, grasshopper abundance tended to be
   lowest and diversity highest in plant communities with intermediate
   levels of biomass and plant species richness.
   These results support the concept that appropriate land use management
   practices would be beneficial for increasing biodiversity, promoting
   grassland sustainability, and reducing outbreaks of the dominant pest
   grasshopper in Inner Mongolia. Our study suggests that different
   management approaches are necessary depending on the average annual
   precipitation and that the driest sites are most vulnerable to
   disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term monitoring of plant community composition and productivity
   provides evidence of how ecosystems respond to climate change. This
   study investigated the long-term (1981-2011) dynamics of plant species
   richness (SR) and community composition of a temperate grassland in
   Inner Mongolia, China, after the exclusion of livestock grazing. During
   the 30 years, SR increased between 1981 and 1991, and then declined from
   1992 to 2011 mainly because of the loss of C-3 forbs as a result of
   decreasing rainfall and increasing temperature. The relative abundance,
   measured as relative biomass (RB), of plant functional groups also
   showed a similar temporal pattern. There was a shift in the RB of both
   dominant species and functional groups. As temperature increased with
   decreasing rainfall during the last 20 years of the study period, the
   abundance of C-3 forbs decreased, while C-4 grasses increased. However,
   shrub species did not show any significant pattern in their dynamics.
   Redundancy analysis indicated that the species composition and plant
   relative abundance of the Inner Mongolian grassland were affected by
   both precipitation and temperature. Our findings help us better
   understand how grassland ecosystems respond to future climate change on
   the Mongolian Plateau where the climate is projected to be drier and

Abstract = {{The link between environmental heterogeneity and diversity is a major
   tenet of plant ecology. Previous studies designed to test the
   heterogeneity-diversity hypothesis largely have only included measures
   characterizing the overall variation in habitat (e.g., CV of soil
   parameters). Rarely has the spatial structure of that variation been
   considered in relation to diversity. Here we examined the spatial
   variability (CV) and spatial structure of that variation (i.e. spatial
   scale of patchiness) of several main soil variables (C, N, P, pH, and
   conductivity) in relation to grassland plant species richness and
   diversity (H'). We determined the relationships of plant species
   richness and diversity at two spatial scales (50 x 50 m plot scale, 1 x
   1 m quadrat scale) with the whole-plot soil heterogeneity within an
   similar to 750 ha natural area of Kerqin grasslands in northeastern
   China. We found that the best models describing species richness at the
   0.25 ha and 1 m(2) scales included patch size of soil conductivity and
   N, respectively. For each of the two spatial scales, pairs of models
   best described H'; a simple regression with CV of soil N and a multiple
   regression including soil N patch size and CV at the 0.25 ha scale, and,
   at the 1 m(2) scale, a simple regression with soil conductivity CV and
   multiple regression including CV and patch size of soil N. Soil N was
   negatively associated with conductivity, likely due to sodium, the
   primary determinant of conductivity in this meadow steppe system,
   inhibiting plant growth and the capacity of soils to accumulate N.
   Consequently our results indicated that the heterogeneity of soil N was
   the principal control of plant species richness and H'. Moreover, our
   findings indicate that spatial structure (the average size of a patch),
   in addition to CV, was important in determining grassland species
   richness and diversity. Our results indicate that both components of
   environmental heterogeneity need to be included in future tests of the
   heterogeneity-diversity hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{Although many studies have demonstrated that grazing may increase or
   decrease plant diversity of grasslands at small scales, few studies have
   examined the patterns and mechanisms of grazing effects on biodiversity
   across multiple scales.
   Our study tested the scale dependence of grazing effects on plant
   diversity based a 7-year grazing manipulation experiment with seven
   levels of grazing intensity (0-9 sheep ha(-1)) in a typical steppe of
   the Inner Mongolia grassland.
   Species area relationships (SARs) were used to analyze the scale
   dependence of species loss. SAR decomposition approaches were followed
   to examine the contribution of four potential mechanisms to changes in
   the slope of SARs, including species aggregation, overall species
   richness, total number of individuals, and species abundance
   distribution.
   The proportional species loss increased with sampling area (4-1024
   m(2)), which was evidenced by decreasing intercepts and slopes of SARs
   with grazing. Reduction in the slope of SARs was mainly caused by
   changes in overall species richness and species abundance distribution,
   with the relative minor effect of changes in number of individuals.
   The negative effect of grazing on overall species richness was mainly
   attributed to the loss of grazing-sensitive rare species from species
   pool. Compared with flat systems, plant diversity in slope systems was
   more sensitive to grazing at low intensities. However, the responses of
   plant diversity to grazing tended to converge between the flat and slope
   systems at high levels of grazing intensity. Our study has important
   implications for adaptive ecosystem management and biodiversity
   conservation in arid and semiarid grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances may affect the spatial patterns of plant genetic diversity,
   but these effects are not yet well understood for lack of direct
   experimental evidence. Grazing is one of such environmental disturbance
   factors which may lead to small-scale spatial heterogeneity in natural
   grasslands.
   Our main goal was to determine whether a grazing disturbance alters
   population genetic diversity and genetic structure of the dominant
   species in the Inner Mongolia Steppe.
   We performed inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) molecular marker
   analysis on populations of Stipa grandis and S. krylovii which were
   exposed to five consecutive years of varying degrees of grazing
   disturbance.
   The amplification results showed that the genetic diversity of both S.
   grandis and S. krylovii populations varied under different grazing
   intensities; the highest diversity (Nei's index and Shannon's index)
   were under moderate disturbance, whereas the lowest under the heavy
   grazing. The coefficient of gene differentiation (G(ST)) of S. grandis
   and S. krylovii populations were 16.82 and 21.00 A degrees\%,
   respectively. These results suggest that the genetic diversity of these
   two dominant populations was altered by the small-scale grazing
   disturbance, which provides new evidence supporting the theories of
   landscape genetics.
   The enhancement of moderate grazing on genetic diversity implies the
   necessity to involve animal grazing in the design of management regimes
   for biodiversity conservation of the Inner Mongolia steppes.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{Small scale distribution of insect root herbivores may promote plant
   species diversity by creating patches of different herbivore pressure.
   However, determinants of small scale distribution of insect root
   herbivores, and impact of land use intensity on their small scale
   distribution are largely unknown. We sampled insect root herbivores and
   measured vegetation parameters and soil water content along transects in
   grasslands of different management intensity in three regions in
   Germany. We calculated community-weighted mean plant traits to test
   whether the functional plant community composition determines the small
   scale distribution of insect root herbivores. To analyze spatial
   patterns in plant species and trait composition and insect root
   herbivore abundance we computed Mantel correlograms. Insect root
   herbivores mainly comprised click beetle (Coleoptera, Elateridae) larvae
   (43\%) in the investigated grasslands. Total insect root herbivore
   numbers were positively related to community-weighted mean traits
   indicating high plant growth rates and biomass (specific leaf area,
   reproductive-and vegetative plant height), and negatively related to
   plant traits indicating poor tissue quality (leaf C/N ratio). Generalist
   Elaterid larvae, when analyzed independently, were also positively
   related to high plant growth rates and furthermore to root dry mass, but
   were not related to tissue quality. Insect root herbivore numbers were
   not related to plant cover, plant species richness and soil water
   content. Plant species composition and to a lesser extent plant trait
   composition displayed spatial autocorrelation, which was not influenced
   by land use intensity. Insect root herbivore abundance was not spatially
   autocorrelated. We conclude that in semi-natural grasslands with a high
   share of generalist insect root herbivores, insect root herbivores
   affiliate with large, fast growing plants, presumably because of
   availability of high quantities of food. Affiliation of insect root
   herbivores with large, fast growing plants may counteract dominance of
   those species, thus promoting plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing can compromise the biotic integrity and health of
   wetlands, especially in remotes areas like Patagonia, which provide
   habitat for several endemic terrestrial and aquatic species.
   Understanding the effects of these land use practices on invertebrate
   communities can help prevent the deterioration of wetlands and provide
   insights for restoration. In this contribution, we assessed the
   responses of 36 metrics based on the structural and functional
   attributes of invertebrates (130 taxa) at 30 Patagonian wetlands that
   were subject to different levels of livestock grazing intensity. These
   levels were categorized as low, medium and high based on eight features
   (livestock stock densities plus seven wetland measurements). Significant
   changes in environmental features were detected across the gradient of
   wetlands, mainly related to pH, conductivity, and nutrient values.
   Regardless of rainfall gradient, symptoms of eutrophication were
   remarkable at some highly disturbed sites. Seven invertebrate metrics
   consistently and accurately responded to livestock grazing on wetlands.
   All of them were negatively related to increased levels of grazing
   disturbance, with the number of insect families appearing as the most
   robust measure. A multivariate approach (RDA) revealed that invertebrate
   metrics were significantly affected by environmental variables related
   to water quality: in particular, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen,
   nutrient concentrations, and the richness and coverage of aquatic
   plants. Our results suggest that the seven aforementioned metrics could
   be used to assess ecological quality in the arid and semi-arid wetlands
   of Patagonia, helping to ensure the creation of protected areas and
   their associated ecological services.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland covers about one quarter of the Earth's land area and is
   currently estimated to contribute to the livelihoods of over 800 million
   people. Grassland provides ecosystem goods and services, mainly through
   the provisioning of milk and meat. Therefore, the proper use of
   grasslands will be essential for feeding the nine billion people that
   will inhabit planet Earth by 2050. In the context of a changing climate,
   we should better understand the interactions of environment, management
   and grass crop at individual, community and ecosystem levels. Functional
   ecology focuses on the roles and functions that species play in the
   community or ecosystem in which they occur. Functional ecology thus aims
   to understand how plant species adapt to environmental conditions and
   how management can alter this adaptation. Here, we review the latest
   advances in plant functional traits research and on species strategies
   to the main environmental factors occurring in grassland ecosystems:

   maintaining productivity and preservation of these semi-natural

Abstract = {{Ecosystem/habitat restoration has become a major goal of international
   biodiversity policy. However, restorations are often limited in space or
   time, and we know little on whether and how restoration and management
   affect vertebrates. Here we assessed the local and landscape-scale
   effects of habitat restoration and management on small-mammal
   communities in the Egyek-Pusztakocs marsh system (Hortobagy National
   Park, Hungary), site of the largest active restoration of grasslands on
   former croplands in Europe. We live-trapped mice, voles and shrews in
   spring and autumn in 2 years (four sampling periods) at two sites in six
   habitat types: croplands, grasslands restored 3-6 years earlier and
   natural grasslands. Data on 421 individuals of 12 species showed that
   restored grasslands were similar to croplands and natural grasslands in
   species richness, abundance and composition. At the local scale,
   management influenced abundance because there were more small mammals in
   unmanaged and early-mown grasslands with taller vegetation than in
   late-mown or grazed grasslands with lower vegetation, or in ploughed
   croplands. Elevation was also important because sites at higher
   elevation provided refuges during spring floods or summer droughts. At
   the landscape scale, the proportion of restored and natural grasslands
   positively affected the abundance of small mammals, whereas the
   proportion of linear habitats (roads, canals) had a negative effect on
   abundance. Our results show that management is more important than
   restoration per se at the local scale, which is expected for habitat
   generalists such as small mammals in contrast to specialists such as
   plant-feeding invertebrates. However, restoration provides
   landscape-scale benefits by increasing the area of grasslands that can
   serve as refuges for small mammals in unfavourable periods. We thus
   conclude that a mosaic of restored and appropriately managed grasslands
   with tall vegetation will provide the best chances for the persistence
   of small-mammal communities in dynamic landscapes.}},

   previously been reported to enjoy associational resistance in mixed
   populations with purple loosestrife {[}Lythrum salicaria L.

   associational susceptibility in mixed populations with raspberry
   {[}Rubus idaeus L. (Rosaceae)] due to a shared herbivore, the raspberry
   flea beetle {[}Batophila rubi (Paykull) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae)].
   Close to raspberry (less than 0.5 m), herbivory on meadowsweet often
   reached 20-25\%, whereas further away (1.5-2 m) herbivory was almost
   always 0\%. We especially highlight the different scales at which the
   opposing associational effects occur. The shared parasitoid forages
   throughout entire populations, making the level of population the focal
   scale of the associational resistance. The shared herbivore, however,
   spills over from raspberry to neighboring meadowsweets only, making the
   distance to individual raspberry plants the focal scale for
   associational susceptibility for meadowsweet. We conclude that different
   co-occurring plant species can mediate opposing associational effects on
   a focal host plant by altering the abundance and composition of
   herbivores and parasitoids, respectively, resulting in multiple

Abstract = {{Grassland ecosystem is critical for survival of herbivores and plays an
   important role in conservation and management of wildlife. These
   habitats are widely studied for various issues, including biodiversity,
   biomass assessment, carrying capacity, etc. Woody species ingression in
   grasslands is one such important aspect that needs critical attention in
   protected area as this leads to shrinking of grasslands habitat. This
   study presents a case of Ronda grassland in Kanha National Park - a
   well-known protected area in India, known for its herbivore diversity
   and hard-ground Barasingha (Rucervus duvaceli branderi), in particular.
   Long-term satellite observation for five decades was carried out to
   understand spatio-temporal changes. Declassified Corona satellite data,
   aerial photographs along with satellite datasets in the subsequent
   period were utilised for this study. The study revealed that 88 ha (16\%
   of Ronda and surrounding) have been ingressed during 1962-2011, in and
   around Ronda grassland of Kanha National Park. Rates of ingression on
   linear transects were found to be 60-120 m per decade. Field studies and
   NDVI analysis along the edge of grassland pixels as well as inside
   region using 1972 as baseline data, indicated woody vegetation replacing
   area of grassland. It was noted that Butea monosperma is invading more
   than other species in Ronda grassland, particularly along the stream
   where moisture availability is higher. Grassland habitats in Kanha are
   thus shrinking and thus leading to reduction in the area available for
   herbivore population which has increased in recent years. This can lead
   to severe impact on carrying capacity of these grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{In recent decades, alpine grasslands have been seriously degraded on the
   Tibetan Plateau and grazing exclusion by fencing has been widely adopted
   to restore degraded grasslands since 2004. To elucidate how alpine
   grasslands carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) storage responds
   to this management strategy, three types of alpine grassland in nine
   counties in Tibet were selected to investigate C, N, and P storage in
   the environment by comparing free grazing (FG) and grazing exclusion
   (GE) treatments, which had run for 6-8years. The results revealed that
   there were no significant differences in total ecosystem C, N, and P
   storage, as well as the C, N, and P stored in both total biomass and
   soil (0-30cm) fractions between FG and GE grasslands. However,
   precipitation played a key role in controlling C, N, and P storage and
   distribution. With grazing exclusion, C and N stored in aboveground
   biomass significantly increased by 5.7g m(-2) and 0.1g m(-2),
   respectively, whereas the C and P stored in the soil surface layer
   (0-15cm) significantly decreased by 862.9g m(-2) and 13.6g m(-2),
   respectively. Furthermore, the storage of the aboveground biomass C, N,
   and P was positively correlated with vegetation cover and negatively
   correlated with the biodiversity index, including Pielou evenness index,
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and Simpson dominance index. The storage
   of soil surface layer C, N, and P was positively correlated with soil
   silt content and negatively correlated with soil sand content. Our
   results demonstrated that grazing exclusion had no impact on total C, N,
   and P storage, as well as C, N, and P in both total biomass and soil
   (0-30cm) fractions in the alpine grassland ecosystem. However, grazing
   exclusion could result in increased aboveground biomass C and N pools

Abstract = {{We surveyed insect communities (Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera) on
   native treelets (Cedrela montana, Heliocarpus americanus, Tabebuia
   chrysantha) planted among anthropogenic land cover types (pasture,
   secondary shrub, and a pine plantation), comparing them among one
   another and to those found on conspecific treelets in adjacent montane
   rainforest. Between 2010 and 2012, we sampled 160 treelets (Pasture: 47,
   Shrub: 26, Pine: 44, Forest: 43). Habitability of reforestations for
   forest insects was quantified by examining species richness, diversity
   partitioning and community composition on reforestations relative to
   natural forest. Species richness was high (phytophagous Coleoptera: 185
   spp., predatory Coleoptera: 101 spp., phytoph. Hemiptera: 174 spp.,
   phytoph. Lepidoptera: 147 spp.) with values being highest in natural
   forest, and significantly lower in all reforestations. Phytophagous
   Coleoptera and Lepidoptera communities showed a trend toward higher
   species richness in pine than in pasture or shrub. Predatory Coleoptera
   showed higher values in pasture and pine compared to shrub. These
   findings suggest that microclimatic effects of surrounding vegetation
   may affect species richness. Given high habitat heterogeneity and
   prevalence of rare species, tree-level alpha-diversity and turn-over
   between individual sample treelets emerged as the strongest contributors
   to overall diversity. Coleoptera community composition was mainly a
   function of habitat, but colonization of reforestations by forest
   species was restricted to phytophagous taxa and contingent on the
   presence of canopy cover. For Hemiptera and Lepidoptera, community
   composition was similar across habitats and determined mainly by host
   species. In summary, young reforestations maintain less diverse insect
   communities compared to natural forest but still harbor a considerable
   number of species, particularly if canopy cover is present.}},

   of herbivores into novel niches and delayed resource tracking by
   parasitoids could fuel diversification at both trophic levels. We used
   DNA barcoding to identify parasitoids that attack larvae of seven
   Pontania sawfly species that induce leaf galls on eight willow species
   growing in subarctic and arctic-alpine habitats in three geographic
   locations in northern Fennoscandia, and then applied distance- and
   model-based multivariate analyses and phylogenetic regression methods to
   evaluate the hierarchical importance of location, phylogeny and
   different galler niche dimensions on parasitoid host use. We found
   statistically significant variation in parasitoid communities across
   geographic locations and willow host species, but the differences were
   mainly quantitative due to extensive sharing of enemies among gallers
   within habitat types. By contrast, the divide between habitats defined
   two qualitatively different network compartments, because many common
   parasitoids exhibited strong habitat preference. Galler and parasitoid
   phylogenies did not explain associations, because distantly related
   arctic-alpine gallers were attacked by a species-poor enemy community
   dominated by two parasitoid species that most likely have independently
   tracked the gallers' evolutionary shifts into the novel habitat. Our

Abstract = {{Land use change effects have emerged as an important area of global
   bioenergy sustainability policy and research. `Underutilised
   agricultural land' has been previously proposed as a potential option
   for future bioenergy feedstock production that may minimise the
   environmental and social challenges of land use change. However, this
   has not been well tested to date. Our research aims to evaluate whether
   conversion of these lands to selected bioenergy crops can lead to
   favourable environmental outcomes for eight indicators related to water
   quantity and quality, and terrestrial biodiversity. A spatially explicit
   evaluation framework based on GIS was developed to quantify the
   environmental effects of land use change. The land use change scenarios,
   established in a case study region in subtropical Queensland, Australia,
   were for the production of Pongamia and two native eucalypt species
   (Spotted gum and Chinchilla white gum) on (i) existing `underutilised'
   open grazing areas, (ii) existing `underutilised' forested grazing
   areas, and (iii) all available `underutilised agricultural land' in the
   case study catchment, under both low and high management intensity. We
   found that environmental benefits can be gained in scenarios where (i)
   open grazing areas (e.g., pastures) were used; (ii) native woody
   perennial bioenergy crops were planted; and (iii) the new plantations
   were under low management intensity. Other scenarios resulted in reduced
   environmental outcomes. The results flagged the importance of careful
   planning and management strategies, and the need for future bioenergy
   policy to provide more detailed prescriptions concerning land use
   planning and management if `underutilised agricultural lands' are used

Abstract = {{There is considerable research on the effects of soil-disturbing
   ecosystem engineers in semi-natural Central European grasslands in terms
   of plant species diversity, soil properties and soil microorganisms.
   However, knowledge on the importance of such ecosystem engineers for
   animal diversity is still relatively rare. In this study we analyse the
   role of Lasius flavus nest mounds as habitats for larvae of the
   declining burnet moth species zygaena purpuralis in calcareous
   grasslands. We assumed that anthills act as preferred larval habitats in
   dependence on climate or vegetation structure. The analysis considers a
   macroclimatic gradient by comparing sites with differing elevation and,
   hence, local climates. Additionally, we analysed the importance of
   anthills for Z. purpuralis along a microclimatic gradient by comparing
   sites with different vegetation structures. The study clearly shows that
   anthills are important larval habitats when general microclimatic
   conditions in the grasslands are unfavourable due to a cool climate at
   higher elevation or dense vegetation. The likelihood of detecting larvae
   of the burnet moth species on sites where anthills were occupied was
   higher on the mounds than within the surrounding vegetation. Anthills
   were preferred as larval habitats by Z. purpuralis as they combine two
   essential elements for successful larval development: (i) a favourable
   microclimate thanks to an open vegetation structure and (ii) a
   sufficient amount of food. The study underlines the importance of L.
   flavus as an ecosystem engineer for maintaining habitat heterogeneity

Abstract = {{AimBiodiversity across the globe is heavily eroded by intensified
   management at local and landscape scales. Species communities of
   calcareous grasslands, which are among Europe's most diverse habitats,
   are severely threatened by the cessation of appropriate traditional
   management, loss of habitat connectivity and simplification of the
   surrounding landscape. However, our understanding of these often
   interrelated factors remains limited, in particular for trait-mediated
   responses across taxa. Here, we test the independent effects of local
   management (grazing, mowing and abandonment), habitat connectivity
   (measured by a connectivity index) and landscape complexity (indicated
   by the percentage of arable land) on nine taxa: plants, butterflies,
   bees, grasshoppers, hoverflies, spiders, true bugs, rove beetles and
   leafhoppers on small semi-natural calcareous grassland remnants (<1ha).
   LocationCentral Germany.
   MethodsWe use a joint analysis across taxa to identify general and
   trait-mediated responses (body size and Red List status) in species
   richness, abundance and community composition.
   ResultsWe identified three key drivers of local diversity patterns:
   First, an increasing proportion of arable land from 10\% to 80\% led to
   a 29\% loss of overall species richness. Second, despite differences
   between taxa, increasing habitat connectivity generally enhanced species
   richness. Connectivity effects were more accentuated in the large
   species per taxon, which can be expected to be good dispersers. Finally,
   grazing reduced species richness and abundance much more than annual
   mowing or short-term abandonment (5-15years), in particular for
   red-listed species. We attribute this to plant resource removal through
   overgrazing and trampling.
   Main conclusionsFor the conservation management of small calcareous
   grasslands, we advocate an alternating strategy of mowing or lenient
   grazing and short-term abandonment, prioritizing connected fragments
   surrounded by diverse landscapes. Despite taxon-specific responses, our
   study across nine taxa demonstrates universal, trait-mediated effects of
   management, landscape complexity and connectivity on local biodiversity

Abstract = {{Recent land use changes, namely the intensification of agriculture and
   forestry as well as the abandonment of traditional grassland management
   methods, have resulted in the decline of butterfly diversity in Europe.
   Appropriate management of butterfly habitats is thus required in order
   to reverse this negative trend. The aim of our study was to review the
   available literary information concerning the effects of various types
   of management on European butterflies of conservation concern, and to
   provide practical recommendations for the management of butterfly
   habitats. Since vegetation succession is a major threat to butterfly
   populations, there is a need for activities to suppress this process.
   Extensive grazing and rotational mowing, which imitate the traditional
   way of meadow use, appear to be the most suitable management in this
   respect. Both grazing and mowing should optimally be of low intensity
   and follow a mosaic design, with different land fragments being
   successively used at different times. Habitat disturbance through
   trampling, either associated with grazing or various sporting activities
   (hiking, biking, horse riding), or through occasional small-area
   burning, also prove to be beneficial for many butterflies. In the case
   of woodland species, maintaining open habitats within forests (glades,
   clearings, wide road verges) and thinning forest stands is recommended.
   Among the unfavourable management activities identified, the most
   harmful are afforestation of open lands and drainage works. Therefore,
   such activities must be stopped at butterfly sites in order to ensure
   the effective conservation of species of conservation concern.}},

Abstract = {{For centuries, the dry grassland of the plain of La Crau (south-eastern
   France) has been subjected to numerous disturbances resulting in the
   destruction and the fragmentation of this emblematic rangeland ecosystem
   of the Mediterranean. Today, this ecosystem is facing a new threat from
   a proliferating native species, the bramble (Rubus ulmifolius Schott),
   which preferentially colonizes areas that were formerly cultivated
   and/or exposed to water infiltration. To identify a strategy for
   effective control of this colonization, in situ experiments testing
   disturbance regimes (shrub clearing and/or mixed grazing by sheep and
   goats) combined with the control of access to water resources (with or
   without drainage trenches) were undertaken between 2010 and 2013. Only
   clearing and grazing combined over 3 years led to significant changes in
   vegetation height and bramble cover as well as modifications in the
   floristic composition, diversity, similarity, and richness of the plant
   community. Neither a clearing operation carried out in 2010 alone, nor
   grazing alone, reduced bramble cover, and neither treatment increased
   the species richness of the plant community. Similarly, digging drainage
   trenches had no significant impact either on the plant community or on
   bramble cover. Our study suggests that only annual mechanical clearing
   coupled with sheep and goats grazing can significantly reduce bramble
   cover. This combined restoration treatment needs to be applied for at
   least 3 consecutive years to induce significant changes and enable this
   ecosystem to return to the dry grassland succession.}},

Abstract = {{The Western Prairie Fringed Orchid (Platanthera praeclara) is a
   threatened species found on the Sheyenne National Grassland (SNG) in
   southeast North Dakota, USA, The SNG is subject to management for
   multiple uses including biodiversity conservation, livestock grazing and
   recreation. Therefore, there is a need for the development of indicators
   of suitable orchid habitat. The orchids are continuously monitored, but
   understanding of the relationship between landscape properties and
   orchid locations is limited. In this study data that characterize
   topography, moisture, and groundwater were used to construct indicators
   of landscape suitability and an overall Habitat Suitability Index (HSI)
   for the orchid. A LiDAR-derived DEM and groundwater well observations
   were used to develop landscape indicators. The Topographic Wetness Index
   (TWI: a measure of moisture on the landscape), the Topographic Position
   Index (TPI: a measure of position on the landscape), and the distance to
   groundwater (DTG: a measure of the distance from the land surface to the
   groundwater surface) provided the best set of indicators of orchid
   habitat. Point-based field observations of orchid occurrence were used
   to develop Orchid Suitability Metrics (OSMs) that identified the range
   of indicator values most strongly associated with orchids. These OSMs
   were used to define year by year suitability zones for each indicator
   that were combined to create the HSI. Comparison of orchid locations
   with groundwater elevations showed that orchids occurred on average 0.98
   +/- 0.39 (2 sigma) m above the water table. TWI and TPI demonstrated
   that orchids occur near flow paths and areas of lower elevation than
   their surroundings. HSI values of 0.67 and above were associated with
   89.8\% of all orchid observations used in the analysis. The landscape
   indicators, OSM concept and HSI could be generally applied to monitoring
   and conservation management of orchid habitat and the concept may be
   applicable to other valued species with similar niche properties. (C)

Abstract = {{Previous studies reported that landscape-level factors are vital to
   support diversity of spiders in strongly modified arable lands and
   disturbed habitats such as managed semi-natural grasslands. Cropland
   management (ploughing, fertilization, and pest management) and
   agricultural practices (mowing and grazing) destroy and/or modify
   regularly the spider assemblages; thus, continuous recolonization from
   the surrounding landscape is vital to sustain the species pool. On the
   contrary, we hypothesized that in unmanaged grasslands, the spider
   assemblages are stable and the importance of recolonization is limited,
   the local factors become much more important drivers in shaping spider
   assemblages than landscape-level factors. We tested the importance of
   local and landscape-level factors on the abundance and species richness
   of spiders in unmanaged grasslands. At the landscape-level, we found
   that only the isolation had significant effect on the total abundance,
   on the abundance of hunting and habitat specialist species, and on the
   abundance of a frequent species (Gnaphosa mongolica). At the local
   scale, however, four out of five studied factors influenced
   significantly the species richness and abundance of spider assemblages
   and the abundance of two frequent species (Alopecosa psammophila,
   Berlandia cinerea). Species richness and abundance increased by plant
   cover, litter cover, and patch size, while decreased by bare ground
   cover. We found that in unmanaged grasslands, the local factors had
   vital role in maintaining the spider species richness; this is just the
   opposite conclusion that was earlier reported for agricultural
   ecosystems, where landscape-level effects had crucial role providing the

Abstract = {{Limitation of disturbances, such as grazing and fire, is a key tool for
   nature reserve management and ecological restoration. While the role of
   these disturbances in shaping ecosystem structure and functioning has
   been intensively studied, less is known about the consequences of
   long-term prevention of grazing and fire. Based on a 31-year study, we
   show that relative biomass of the dominant grass, Leymus chinensis, of
   grasslands in northern China declined dramatically, but only after 21
   years of exclusion of fire and grazing. However, aboveground net primary
   productivity (ANPP) did not decline accordingly due to compensatory
   responses of several subdominant grass species. The decline in dominance
   of L. chinensis was not related to gradually changing climate during the
   same period, whereas experimentally imposed litter removal (simulating
   fire), mowing (simulating grazing), fire and moderate grazing enhanced
   dominance of L. chinensis significantly. Thus, our findings show that
   disturbances can be critical to maintain the dominance of key grass
   species in semiarid grassland, but that the collapse of a dominant
   species does not necessarily result in significant change in ANPP if
   there are species in the community capable of compensating for loss of a

Abstract = {{A few studies in the past have shown that plant diversity in terms of
   species richness and functional composition can modify plant defense
   chemistry. However, it is not yet clear to what extent genetic
   differentiation of plant chemotypes or phenotypic plasticity in response
   to diversity-induced variation in growth conditions or a combination of
   both is responsible for this pattern. We collected seed families of
   ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata) from six-year old experimental
   grasslands of varying plant diversity (Jena Experiment). The offspring
   of these seed families was grown under standardized conditions with two
   levels of light and nutrients. The iridoid glycosides, catalpol and
   aucubin, and verbascoside, a caffeoyl phenylethanoid glycoside, were
   measured in roots and shoots. Although offspring of different seed
   families differed in the tissue concentrations of defensive metabolites,
   plant diversity in the mothers' environment did not explain the
   variation in the measured defensive metabolites of P. lanceolata
   offspring. However secondary metabolite levels in roots and shoots were
   strongly affected by light and nutrient availability. Highest
   concentrations of iridoid glycosides and verbascoside were found under
   high light conditions, and nutrient availability had positive effects on
   iridoid glycoside concentrations in plants grown under high light
   conditions. However, verbascoside concentrations decreased under high
   levels of nutrients irrespective of light. The data from our greenhouse
   study show that phenotypic plasticity in response to environmental
   variation rather than genetic differentiation in response to plant
   community diversity is responsible for variation in secondary metabolite
   concentrations of P. lanceolata in the six-year old communities of the
   grassland biodiversity experiment. Due to its large phenotypic
   plasticity P. lanceolata has the potential for a fast and efficient
   adjustment to varying environmental conditions in plant communities of
   different species richness and functional composition.}},

   reductions in historical disturbances such as fire and grazing. We
   designed an experiment on Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, to test
   methods of establishing native-species-rich coastal sandplain grassland
   on former agricultural land. We tested the efficacy of: (1) tilling,
   herbicide, hot foam, and plastic cover in removing initial nonnative
   vegetation, and (2) combinations of tilling and seeding for establishing
   native species. We measured native and nonnative species richness and
   percent cover before and for 5 years after treatment. Herbicide, plastic
   cover, and spring, summer, and fall tilling were about equally effective
   in reducing nonnative species cover and promoting native species cover.
   Tilling and seeding each increased native species richness and percent
   cover, and seeding and tilling together increased native species
   richness and cover more than either treatment alone. Combined seeding
   and disturbance also reduced the cover of nonnative species, but
   nonnative species cover remained higher than in adjacent reference
   sandplain grassland. Results indicated that native species establishment
   was enhanced by the availability of seeds and by reduction of initial

Abstract = {{Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC is a woody plant from the Americas that has
   dispersed worldwide via human intervention. Typically introduced with
   good intentions, Prosopis often proliferates and degrades native
   ecosystems. Prosopis first appeared in the Allideghi Wildlife Reserve
   (AWR) of northeastern Ethiopia in 1997. In 2005-2006 we determined: (1)
   patterns of Prosopis dispersal and establishment using
   global-positioning system mapping and seed-bank assessments; (2) impacts
   of Prosopis on cover composition and species richness of grassland
   vegetation using transects at replicated Prosopis stands that varied by
   tree size; and (3) attitudes of local people toward Prosopis using focus
   groups and interviews. Prosopis seeds first arrived in the AWR after
   pastoral livestock consumed seedpods along the Awash River, some 50 km
   away. Seeds have been deposited in corrals at recently established
   pastoral settlements within the AWR, and saplings now sprout along
   livestock trails. Prosopis has also colonized the AWR core grassland
   area, a vital habitat for wild grazers. Compared with sites lacking
   Prosopis, the largest class of Prosopis significantly reduced understory
   basal cover for perennial grasses from 68\% to 2\%, increased soil
   surface exposure from 30\% to 80\%, and lowered the number of grass
   species from seven to two. Attitudes of pastoralists toward Prosopis
   have become more negative over time. Local communities use Prosopis via
   limited charcoal production with some grinding of the seedpods for
   livestock feed. Infested sites are cleared by hand, but control has been
   ineffective. Because pastoral livestock are the main vectors for
   Prosopis seed dispersal and facilitate establishment, they will help
   transform the core of the AWR ecosystem from open grassland to denuded
   Prosopis woodland. While this bodes ill for grazing animals in general,
   it has particularly negative implications for the survival of an
   isolated population of an endangered, grass-dependent species-Grevy's

Abstract = {{Better understanding the influence of precipitation and temperature on
   plant assemblages is needed to predict the effects of climate change.
   Many studies have examined the relationship between plant productivity
   and weather (primarily precipitation), but few have directly assessed
   the relationship between plant richness or diversity and weather despite
   their increased use as metrics of ecosystem condition. We focus on the
   grasslands of central North America, which are characterized by high
   temporal climatic variability. Over the next 100 years, these grasslands
   are predicted to experience further increased variability in growing
   season precipitation, as well as increased temperatures, due to global
   climate change. We assess the portion of interannual variability of
   richness and diversity explained by weather, how relationships between
   these metrics and weather vary among plant assemblages, and which
   aspects of weather best explain temporal variability. We used an
   information-theoretic approach to assess relationships between long-term
   plant richness and diversity patterns and a priori weather covariates
   using six data sets from four grasslands. Weather explained up to 49\%
   and 63\% of interannual variability in total plant species richness and
   diversity, respectively. However, richness and diversity responses to
   specific weather variables varied both among sites and among
   experimental treatments within sites. In general, we found many
   instances in which temperature was of equal or greater importance as
   precipitation, as well as evidence of the importance of lagged effects
   and precipitation or temperature variability. Although precipitation has
   been shown to be a key driver of productivity in grasslands, our results
   indicate that increasing temperatures alone, without substantial changes
   in precipitation patterns, could have measurable effects on Great Plains
   grassland plant assemblages and biodiversity metrics. Our results also
   suggest that richness and diversity will respond in unique ways to

Abstract = {{Altered disturbance regimes are a major driver of biodiversity loss
   worldwide. Maintaining or re-creating natural disturbance regimes is
   therefore the focus of many conservation programmes. A key challenge,
   however, is to understand how co-occurring disturbances interact to
   affect biodiversity. We experimentally tested for the interactive
   effects of prescribed fire and large macropod herbivores on the
   web-building spider assemblage of a eucalypt forest understorey and
   investigated the role of vegetation in mediating these effects using
   path analysis. Fire had strong negative effects on the density of
   web-building spiders, which were partly mediated by effects on
   vegetation structure, while negative effects of large herbivores on web
   density were not related to changes in vegetation. Fire amplified the
   effects of large herbivores on spiders, both via vegetation-mediated
   pathways and by increasing herbivore activity. The importance of
   vegetation-mediated pathways and fire-herbivore interactions differed
   for web density and richness and also differed between web types. Our
   results demonstrate that for some groups of web-building spiders, the
   effects of co-occurring disturbance drivers may be mostly additive,
   whereas for other groups, interactions between drivers can amplify
   disturbance effects. In our study system, the use of prescribed fire in
   the presence of high densities of herbivores could lead to reduced
   densities and altered composition of web-building spiders, with
   potential cascading effects through the arthropod food web. Our study
   highlights the importance of considering both the independent and
   interactive effects of disturbances, as well as the mechanisms driving
   their effects, in the management of disturbance regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic land use may shape vegetation composition and affect

   that (2) changes in plant chemistry affect abundances of the herbivorous

   parasitoid Mesopolobus incultus, in the field. We determined plant
   species richness, P. lanceolata density, and abundances of the

   Parasitoid abundance correlated positively only with host abundance over

Abstract = {{The dynamics of the natural process of recuperation of the structure and
   diversity of native vegetation following anthropogenic disturbance has
   been the subject of a great deal of controversy in restoration ecology
   research. The present study evaluates the natural regeneration of
   savanna forest (cerradao) 32 and 36 years after the clear-cutting of the
   vegetation. We compared species diversity, and the structure and
   dynamics of the vegetation in two communities, one representing
   preserved cerradao (PC), and the other, the regenerating cerradao (RC),
   which was clear-cut in 1976. Surveys were conducted in 2008 and 2012, 32
   and 36 years after clear-cutting, respectively. In 2008, we demarcated
   81 permanent 10 m x 10 m plots, 50 in the RC and 31 in the PC, and
   measured all live plants with a diameter at soil level >= 5 cm. In 2012,
   the plots were resampled, including the original plants and all the
   recruits. The species were classified as specialists in savanna (SA) or
   forest habitat (FO), or as generalists (SA/FO). The RC presented the
   highest species richness and diversity, density, annual increment, and
   mortality rates. However, no significant differences were found between
   communities in the distribution of specialist or generalist species, or
   between years (2008 and 2012) in basal area or recruitment rates. While
   the species composition of the two communities is highly similar, the RC
   was characterized by a higher frequency of SA species, and was more
   similar to nearby savanna communities (cerrado sensu stricto). Trees in
   the RC were smaller and suffered higher rates of mortality than those in
   the PC, but also higher annual increments. While the RC demonstrated a
   high degree of resilience following clear-cutting, it was still found to
   be at an intermediate stage of succession, even after almost four
   decades, indicating that regeneration is a slow process.}},

Abstract = {{1. The DEFRA ecosystem services framework was implemented in an
   entomological context to provide preliminary estimates of the economic
   value of four key ecosystem service benefits delivered by dung beetles
   (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae, Geotrupidae) to the U.K. cattle industry and
   individual cattle farmers. These benefits included (i) reduced pest
   flies; (ii) reduced gastrointestinal parasites; (iii) reduced pasture
   fouling and (iv) increased soil nutrients. 2. A mesocosm experiment was
   carried out to quantify the impacts of anthelmintic treatment on dung
   removal by dung beetles when (i) cattle were excreting anthelmintics
   (which affect dung beetles) in a sufficient concentration to impact dung
   beetles and (ii) when cattle were not excreting dung containing
   anthelmintics (which affect dung beetles) in a sufficient concentration
   to impact dung beetles. 3. Inferring from our mesocosm experiment and
   existing data, the value of the benefits of dung beetles under current
   farming practices (and current anthelmintic usage) was estimated. We
   estimated the potential economic benefits if dung beetles were protected
   (i) under all entry-level agri-environment schemes; (ii) under organic
   schemes; or (iii) if farmers stopped treating adult cattle with
   anthelmintics during the grazing season. 4. While these estimates are
   preliminary, and should not be treated as definitive values, we suggest
   that dung beetles may be currently saving the U.K. cattle industry c.
   367million each year: c. 354million in conventional systems and c.
   13million in organic systems. Annual benefits per cow are greater in
   organic systems (43.47) pound compared with conventional systems (37.42)
   pound. 5. Protecting dung beetles under agri-environment schemes could
   save the U.K. cattle industry an additional 40.2millionyear(-1) pound
   (4.36 pound per cow), while protecting dung beetles under organic
   schemes could save 378k pound year(-1) (1.26 pound per cow). The
   cessation of, largely unnecessary, treatment of adult cattle with
   anthelmintics could save the U.K. cattle industry an additional
   6.2millionyear(-1) pound (1.40 pound per cow) in addition to savings on
   the anthelmintics themselves. 6. These estimates are based on a large
   number of underlying assumptions and, thus, may be overestimating or
   underestimating the economic value of ecosystem services delivered by
   dung beetles. 7. The potential for using the DEFRA ecosystem services
   framework in an entomological context is highlighted. These estimates
   emphasise the contribution of dung beetles as key Ecosystem Service
   Providers (ESP's) within the U.K. cattle sector and, by extension,
   emphasise the importance of valuing supporting ecosystem services
   derived from invertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing animals walk outdoors and harvest fresh herbage from a
   three-dimensional canopy. Botanical composition and grassland management
   in various farming systems affect herbage intake and milk fatty acid
   (FA) composition. Grazing animals encounter a vertical gradient while
   grazing down a sward; responses in milk FA composition are discussed.
   Grazing animals have diets rich in poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA),
   particularly -linolenic acid (C18:3n-3). Concentrates and starch-rich
   fodders affect rumen retention time of the feed, increase linoleic acid
   (C18:2n-6) intake, and alter biohydrogenation pathways toward less n-3
   PUFA and less rumenic acid (conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) isomer
   C18:2c9t11), leading to lower contents of these compounds in the milk.
   Milk from grazing-based production systems including organic systems,
   therefore, has less saturated and more n-3PUFA and CLAc9t11 which is
   considered beneficial for health. The occurrence of natural trans FA
   (t11) in milk predominates with grazing whereas intensive feeding
   practices enhance t10-FA, with possible negative health effects. FA
   intake - output relations can differ among plant species due to rapid
   rumen passage rate or compounds protecting PUFA, resulting in more PUFA
   in milk. Methodological constraints for FA measurement in herbages are
   discussed. Trends in grazing and dairy farming systems and implications
   for milk FA composition are addressed. Practical applications: Grazing
   is important for fresh forage intake, animal health and natural
   behaviour, landscape values and grassland biodiversity. Grazing is a
   political, societal and marketing issue in The Netherlands where
   retailers since 2011 sell dairy products labelled as pasture-milk and
   dairies pay a premium to farmers whose cows get access to pasture.
   Grazing affects green leaf intake because animals can select. Pasture
   allowance enhances -linolenic acid and CLAc9t11 (rumenic acid)
   concentrations in milk fat. FA need to be designated by unique names;
   CLA is a generic term and isomers give rise to different biological
   responses. As some forbs reduce biohydrogenation, grassland species
   diversity may improve PUFA transfer efficiency from feed to milk. Trends
   in animal genetics and increased herd size, TMR feeding and automated
   milking systems cause reduction of grazing in Europe, which can increase
   saturated and trans-10 milk FA concentrations and reduce naturally
   occurring fat-soluble vitamins and antioxidants in dairy products.
   Grazing (pasture-feeding versus indoor with conserved forage and
   concentrates) increases n-3 PUFA and trans-11 over trans-10 FA in cow
   milk when cows can select, as leaves have high n-3 PUFA concentrations;
   biodiverse grasslands enhance this effect as some forbs show less PUFA
   rumen biohydrogenation than grasses, thus increasing efficiency of PUFA
   transfer from forage to milk.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term, slow ecological processes such as changes in plant community
   structure and composition strongly regulate ecosystem responses to
   climate change. Shifts in plant community are expected in chronically
   altered environments under warming. However, experimental evidence for
   long-term shifts and the associated mechanisms is still scarce in
   temperate grasslands. Here, we explore the long-term responses of a
   prairie plant community to 14-year (2000-2013) manipulations of climate
   warming and clipping in Oklahoma, USA. Infrared heaters were used to
   elevate soil temperature by about 2 degrees C all year round, and annual
   clipping was applied to mimic hay harvest. Community composition was
   resistant to experimental warming in the first seven years, but started
   to show responses starting from the eighth year; clipping consistently
   affected community composition over the years. Compositional change
   under long-term warming was mainly due to one invasive species and three
   dominant species. The negative correlations in relative abundance
   between the invasive species and the dominant species suggest
   interspecific competition. Community structure (i.e. richness, evenness
   and diversity) had no overall response to experimental warming. However,
   in 2007, the extreme wet year, warming reduced species richness by 30\%.
   Clipping promoted species richness by 10\% on average over the 14years
   but decreased community evenness. Warming did not interact with clipping
   in influencing the plant community variables.Synthesis. Our study
   provides experimental evidence for long-term shifts in plant community
   composition due to warming and revealed novel mechanisms (i.e. species
   invasion and associated biotic interactions) underlying the long-term
   shift. The results also suggest that climate extremes may elicit or
   advance community responses to climate warming. The findings highlight
   that long-term climate change experiments are essential to reveal
   potential shifts in community composition.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient supply and herbivores can regulate plant species composition,

   enrichment frequently increases plant productivity and decreases
   diversity while herbivores tend to maintain plant diversity in

   and herbivores regulate plant diversity remain unclear. Abundance-based
   mechanisms propose that fertilization leads to the extinction of rare
   species due to random loss of individuals of all species. In contrast,
   functional-based mechanisms propose that species exclusion is based on
   functional traits which are disadvantageous under fertilized conditions.
   We tested mechanistic links between fertilization and diversity loss in
   the presence or absence of consumers using data from a 4-year
   fertilization and fencing experiment in an alpine meadow. We found that
   both abundance- and functional-based mechanisms simultaneously affected
   species loss in the absence of herbivores while only abundance-based
   mechanisms affected species loss in the presence of herbivores. Our
   results indicate that an abundance-based mechanism may consistently play
   a role in the loss of plant diversity with fertilization, and that
   diversity decline is driven primarily by the loss of rare species

Abstract = {{The high grasslands at Bolivian Andes provide a natural habitat for a
   high number of wild and domestic South American camelids such as vicuna
   (Vicugna vicugna) and alpaca (Lama pacos). Because of the importance of
   the camelid raising for the Andean inhabitants economy and the
   sustainable biodiversity, it is fundamental to determine the natural
   resources condition and their availability to camelids. The objectives
   of this research were to: (i) evaluate the soil fertility; (ii)
   characterize the plant communities and its relationship with the
   landscape; and (iii) analyze the effect of the camelid populations on
   soil properties, vegetation cover and plant species richness. Soil and
   vegetation samplings were carried out in eight areas with different
   vicuna densities. Results pointed out no effect of grazing camelids on
   soil properties, including soil fertility in all areas. The most
   plentiful plant community was Pycnophyllum sp. grassland, although it
   was highly disturbed due to domestic camelid grazing. The studied areas
   presented medium (30-50\%) and high plant cover (>50\%). The
   substitution of palatable by non palatable plant species in those zones
   with high alpaca concentration highlighted the negative domestic camelid
   effect on vegetation composition. No effect of vicuna grazing on
   vegetation was observed. However, some protection actions should be
   undertaken to prevent biodiversity decline by bringing resource over
   exploitation by domestic camelids in the Bolivian Andes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition of the importance for local biodiversity
   of post-mining sites, many of which lie near communities that have
   suffered significant social and economic deprivation as the result of
   mine closures. However, no studies to date have actively used the
   knowledge of local communities to relate the history and treatment of
   post-mining sites to their current ecological status. We report a study
   of two post-mining sites in the Yorkshire coalfield of the UK in which
   the local community were involved in developing site histories and
   assessing plant and invertebrate species composition. Site histories
   developed using participatory GIS revealed that the sites had a mixture
   of areas of spontaneous succession and technical reclamation, and
   identified that both planned management interventions and informal
   activities influenced habitat heterogeneity and ecological diversity.
   Two groups of informal activity were identified as being of particular
   importance. Firstly, there has been active protection by the community
   of flower-rich habitats of conservation value (e.g. calcareous
   grassland) and distinctive plant species (e.g. orchids) which has also
   provided important foraging resources for butterfly and bumblebee
   species. Secondly, disturbance by activities such as use of motorbikes,
   informal camping, and cutting of trees and shrubs for fuel, as well as
   planned management interventions such as spreading of brick rubble, has
   provided habitat for plant species of open waste ground and locally
   uncommon invertebrate species which require patches of bare ground. This
   study demonstrates the importance of informal, and often unrecorded,
   activities by the local community in providing diverse habitats and
   increased biodiversity within a post-mining site, and shows that active
   engagement with the local community and use of local knowledge can
   enhance ecological interpretation of such sites and provide a stronger
   basis for successful future management.}},

Abstract = {{Sparing zones from mowing has been proposed, and applied, to improve
   local conditions for survival and reproduction of insects in hay
   meadows. However, little is known about the efficiency of refuge zones
   and the consequences for local populations. We studied population
   densities of butterflies before and after mowing in the refuge zone of
   15 meadows in 2009 and 2011. We also studied the behaviour of the meadow
   brown (Maniola jurtina) comparing nectar use, interactions and flights
   in the refuge zone before and after mowing. Densities of grassland
   butterflies in this zone doubled on average after mowing. The density of
   females of M. jurtina increased on average fourfold, while males showed
   a more modest increase. In line with the idea of increased scramble
   competition in the refuge zone after mowing, M. jurtina increased the
   time spent on nectar feeding, the preferred nectar source was visited
   more frequently, and females made more use of non-preferred nectar
   sources. Maniola jurtina did not interact more with conspecifics after
   mowing, but interactions lasted longer. Flight tracks did not change in
   linearity, but were faster and shorter after mowing. After mowing, only
   a part of the local grassland butterflies moved to the uncut refuge
   zone. The resulting concentration effect alters the time allocated to
   different activities, nectar use and movements. These aspects have been
   largely ignored for agri-environmental schemes and grassland management
   in nature reserves and raise questions about optimal quantities and
   quality of uncut refuge sites for efficient conservation of grassland

Abstract = {{Wetland stopover use by migratory shorebirds is concurrently influenced
   by habitat characteristics within a stopover site and characteristics
   related to the broader context surrounding the stopover site. To
   conserve wetland habitats essential for shorebird migration through the
   interior of North America, we need to understand how these dual scales
   influence stopover use. We surveyed >14,000 wetlands within 10
   broad-scale landscapes in north-central Oklahoma from 2007 through 2009
   to determine how characteristics within (intra) and surrounding
   (context) wetlands influence the density and species richness of
   migrating shorebirds at stopover sites. We used zero-inflated modeling
   and an information theoretic framework to separately examine and then
   compare the relative importance of intra-habitat variables and habitat
   context variables in explaining use of stopovers. We observed 38,288
   migratory shorebirds of 29 species. Shorebirds were least likely to
   occur in isolated, small, steep-sided wetland habitats. Among
   intra-patch variables, shorebird density and richness were best
   explained by wetland habitat area, slope, and the cover and height of
   vegetation within a wetland. Shorebird density and richness were more
   than 2 times higher in large wetland habitats (i.e. >3.3 ha), and both
   decreased with increased vegetation and slope. The density of wetlands
   within 1.5 km of a stopover site had the greatest impact on shorebird
   density and richness among patch context variables. As habitat density
   increased from 0.07 to 1, shorebird abundance and richness increased by
   >200\%. Shorebirds were positively related to grazing pressure but
   negatively related to forest/shrubland, urban/suburban development, and
   grassland land cover contexts. When compared to models with
   intra-habitat variables, models containing habitat context variables
   better explained migratory shorebird density and richness. We conclude
   that characteristics related to the broader context surrounding a
   wetland stopover sites strongly influence stopover use by migratory
   shorebirds. Conservation and management of shorebirds migrating through
   the continental interior should aim to provide large expanses of
   sparsely vegetated and shallow habitats within stopover sites and focus
   on open landscapes that contain high densities of stopover habitats.}},

Abstract = {{It is the most serious challenge to promote degraded grassland recovery
   currently facing the developing Tibetan Autonomous Region. We conducted
   field surveys of 75 grazing sites between 2009 and 2012 across the
   Northern Tibetan Plateau and described the spatial and climatic patterns
   of the occurrence of poisonous plants. Our results showed lower ratios
   of species richness (SprRatio), coverage (CovRatio), and biomass
   (BioRatio) of non-poisonous vs. poisonous plants in the semi-arid alpine
   steppe zone, where the growing season precipitation (GSP) is between 250
   and 350 mm; however, this result is in contrast to the relatively wetter
   meadow (GSP >350 mm) and much drier desert-steppe (GSP <250mm)
   communities. Results from generalized additive models (GAMs) further
   confirmed that precipitation is primarily responsible for the initially
   decreasing and then increasing tendency of compositional ratios of
   non-poisonous to poisonous species. The wide confidence bands at GSP
   <250 mm indicated that precipitation is not an effective indicator for
   predicting compositional changes in desert-steppe communities. When mean
   annual livestock grazing pressure was incorporated into the optimal
   GAMs, the model performance improved: the Akaike information criterion
   (AIC) decreased by 1.20 for SprRatio and 3.09 for BioRatio, and the
   deviance explained (R2) increased by 6.0 \% for SprRatio and 3.6 \% for
   BioRatio. Therefore, more detailed information on grazing disturbance
   (timing, frequency, and density) should be collected to disentangle the
   relative contribution of climate change and grazing activities to
   changes in community assembly and ecological functions of alpine
   grasslands on the Northern Tibetan Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{The expansion (or encroachment) of shrubs in forests and woodlands is
   generally considered a serious threat to biodiversity. The effects of
   shrub expansion on forest fauna, however, are poorly understood and
   likely to depend on the availability of key resources in
   shrub-encroached forest. Coranderrk Bushland, like many conservation
   reserves in south-eastern Australia, is considered threatened by the
   spread of an indigenous shrub. We investigated the associations between
   cover of Yarra burgan (Kunzea leptospermoides (Myrtaceae)), vegetation
   structure and the occurrence of terrestrial native mammals within the
   reserve, basing our predictions on prior knowledge of burgan growth
   habits and fauna habitat preferences. We quantified burgan cover and
   other potentially important habitat attributes using structure surveys,
   and used motion-sensing cameras to detect terrestrial mammals. Dense
   burgan cover was associated with less grass, a sparser understorey, and
   more cryptogams, dead trees and coarse woody debris. However, there was
   no evidence that these changes negatively affected native mammals:
   burgan cover had little influence on the occurrence of any species
   except swamp wallabies (Wallabia bicolor), which occurred in all areas
   of the reserve but shifted from sites with high burgan cover during the
   day to sites with low cover at night. Our findings contrast with those
   from grassland shrub-expansion studies, where fauna generally show
   strong responses to shrub cover. The effects of shrub expansion on
   forest fauna may be mitigated by the greater pre-existing structural
   diversity in forests or the longer time required for structural changes
   to be fully realized. The large quantities of dead wood in areas with
   high shrub cover may also provide compensatory resources for small
   mammals, while the proximity to un-encroached areas may enable large
   herbivores to move between dense shelter and forage. Shrub-encroached
   forests clearly provide resources for some native fauna, and management
   strategies need to consider the potential impacts of shrub removal on
   these taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in the deposition of nitrogen affect biodiversity and the

Abstract = {{Although traditional land-use and management practices are known to
   enhance environmental heterogeneity in agricultural lands, loss of
   heterogeneity resulting from recent land-use changes can lead to
   spatiotemporal -diversity losses (biotic homogenization). However,
   patterns and causes of -diversity loss, especially at a within-field
   scale, have remained unexplored. We examined -diversity declines in
   plants, butterflies and orthopterans resulting from land abandonment and
   intensification in semi-natural grasslands on paddy margins at a
   within-field scale in relation to changes in disturbance frequency and
   surrounding landscapes by surveying eight abandoned, thirteen
   traditional and ten intensive paddy terraces. Three indices, the
   additive partitioning of species richness ((add)) and the turnover
   ((tu)) and nestedness ((ne)) components of Jaccard dissimilarity of
   plants and herbivores, were used to evaluate different aspects of
   -diversity. We hypothesized that biotic homogenization due to
   abandonment and intensification would be expressed as low spatiotemporal
   (add) and (tu), low spatial (ne) and high temporal (ne). The spatial and
   temporal (add) of plants and herbivores were higher in traditional
   terraces than in others. Changes in mowing frequency caused direct
   declines in butterfly (add) and indirectly decreased herbivore (add)
   through diminished plant (add) in abandoned and intensified terraces.
   Neighbouring forests increased plant spatial and butterfly temporal
   (add) and (tu). Abandoned terraces had higher orthopteran spatial and
   plant temporal (tu) than traditional terraces. Mowing frequency
   generally did not influence spatial and temporal (tu) of plants and
   herbivores. In intensive terraces, temporal (ne) of plants were higher
   than in traditional terraces, suggesting dominance by plant species
   sharing similar phenologies.Synthesis and applications. These results
   suggest that traditional mowing practices are essential for maintaining
   plant and herbivore (add), and consequently, species pools within
   terraces. The higher spatial or temporal species turnover of plants and
   orthopterans in abandoned terraces and higher temporal plant nestedness
   in intensive than in traditional terraces were not due to increases in
   species pools within terraces. Because within-terrace environmental
   heterogeneity is thought to remain in abandoned and intensive terraces,
   we recommend reduction in mowing frequency in intensive terraces and

Abstract = {{Management of high-nature-value (HNV) grasslands follows
   agri-environmental schemes across large areas of Europe. Long-term
   agreements and restrictions of fertilizers cause soil nutrient
   impoverishment, but remarkably this quite often does not reduce biomass
   production. Therefore, we tested how species-rich vegetation copes with
   nutrient impoverishment under the most frequently used treatments, that
   is summer mowing and livestock grazing. During 2011-2012 we studied,
   simultaneously, plant species composition, soil and biomass chemical
   properties in two equally designed experiments where mowing, grazing or
   leaving fallow have been applied since 2004. We asked whether soil-based
   (C-org:N-tot, plant-available P and K) and plant-based measures (N:P,
   N:K, K:P ratios and N-, P-, K-nutrition indices) indicate the same
   pattern of nutrient limitation as the observed productivity gradient.
   Seven years of management application resulted in the lowest
   plant-available P under grazing and the lowest plant-available K under
   mowing, but neither grazed nor mown plots produced less biomass than
   fallow ones. Grazing supported dominance of grasses while mowing that of
   non-leguminous forbs. Projection of nutrition indices to a common
   framework with nutrient ratios suggests that critical thresholds for
   diagnosis of nutrient limitation are a function of N deficiency. At
   biomass production of 2tha(-1) a N-nutrition index of 50 yielded
   threshold N:P=140; hence, all our treatments with N:P of 99-125 should
   be N limited. Inspecting the productivity gradient separately for each
   management, we found only soil C-org:N-tot negatively related to biomass
   production in mown plots indicating N limitation. However in grazed
   plots, positive association of biomass production with plant-available P
   and negative with biomass N:P and N:K suggested PK
   co-limitation.Synthesis and applications. Mowing and grazing induced
   different patterns of soil nutrient impoverishment and nutrient
   limitation, but they did not reduce biomass production of
   high-nature-value grasslands. Non-leguminous forbs prevailing under
   mowing precluded shortage of P, while grasses dominating under grazing
   efficiently captured N. We recommend designing agri-environmental
   measures that will encourage alternating mowing and grazing. This should
   promote coexistence of multiple forbs and grasses, balance nutrient
   limitation and ensure stable biomass production under future low-input
   scenarios.

Abstract = {{Grasshoppers are important components of grassland invertebrate
   communities, particularly as nutrient recyclers and as prey for many
   bird species. Sown margin strips are key features of agri-environmental
   schemes in European agricultural landscapes and have been shown to
   benefit grasshoppers depending on the initial sown seed mixture.
   Understanding the mechanisms by which the sown mixture impacts
   grasshoppers in sown margin strips is the aim of our study. Here, we
   investigated plant-grasshopper interactions in sown margin strips and
   the respective effects of plant identity and diversity on grasshoppers.
   We surveyed plants and grasshoppers in 44 sown margin strips located in
   Western France which were initially established with three sowing
   mixtures dominated, respectively, by alfalfa, Festuca rubra and Lolium
   perenne and Festuca arundinacea. Grasshopper species contrasted in their
   response to plant diversity and to the abundance of sown and non-sown
   plant species. Some grasshopper species were positively correlated with
   the abundance of grass and especially of a single sown plant species, F.
   rubra. In contrast, other grasshopper species benefited from high plant
   diversity likely due to their high degree of polyphagy. At the community
   level, these contrasted responses were translated into a positive linear
   relationship between grass cover and grasshopper abundance and into a
   quadratic relationship between plant diversity and grasshopper diversity
   or abundance. Since plant identity and diversity are driven by the
   initial sown mixture, our study suggests that by optimizing the seed
   mixture, it is possible to manage grasshopper diversity or abundance in
   sown margin strips.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Grazing lawns are a distinct grassland community type, characterised by
   short-stature and with their persistence and spread promoted by grazing.
   In Africa, they reveal a long co-evolutionary history of grasses and
   large mammal grazers. The attractiveness to grazers of a low-biomass
   sward lies in the relatively high quality of forage, largely due to the
   low proportion of stem material in the sward; this encourages repeat
   grazing that concomitantly suppresses tall-grass growth forms that would
   otherwise outcompete lawn species for light. Regular grazing that
   prevents shading and maintains sward quality is thus the cornerstone of
   grazing lawn dynamics. The strong interplay between abiotic conditions
   and disturbance factors, which are central to grazing lawn existence,
   can also cause these systems to be highly dynamic. Here we identify
   differences in growth form among grazing lawn grass species, and assess
   how compositional differences among lawn types, as well as environmental
   variables, influence their maintenance requirements (i.e. grazing
   frequency) and vulnerability to degradation. We also make a clear
   distinction between the processes of lawn establishment and lawn
   maintenance. Rainfall, soil nutrient status, grazer community
   composition and fire regime have strong and interactive influences on
   both processes. However, factors that concentrate grazing pressure (e.g.
   nutrient hotspots and sodic sites) have more bearing on where lawns
   establish. Similarly, we discuss the relevance of enhanced rates of
   nitrogen cycling and of sodium levels to lawn maintenance. Grazer
   community composition and density has considerable significance to
   grazing lawn dynamics; not all grazers are adapted to foraging on
   short-grass swards, and differences in body size and relative mouth
   dimensions determine which species are able to convert tall-grass swards
   into grazing lawns under different conditions. Hence, we evaluate the
   roles of different grazers in lawn dynamics, as well as the benefits
   that grazer populations derive from having access to grazing lawns. The
   effects of grazing lawns can extend well beyond their borders, due to
   their influence on grazer densities, behaviour and movements as well as
   fire spread, intensity and frequency. Variation in the area and
   proportion of a landscape that is grazing lawn can thus have a profound
   impact on system dynamics. We provide a conceptual model that summarises
   grazing lawn dynamics, and identify a rainfall range where we predict
   grazing lawns to be most prevalent. We also examine the biodiversity
   associated with grazing lawn systems, and consider their functional
   contribution to the conservation of this biodiversity. Finally, we
   assess the utility of grazing lawns as a resource in a rangeland
   context.}},

Abstract = {{It is well documented that large herbivores have pronounced effects on
   plant communities in grassland ecosystems, and the extent and course of
   their effects can largely depend on both plant and herbivore
   characteristics. Previous studies highlighted the importance of plant
   productivity in predicting the impact of herbivores on grasslands. Yet,
   there has been little consideration of how different herbivores affect
   plant communities that, in turn, differ in plant diversity. In a 2-year
   grazing experiment, we tested the effects of large herbivores (cattle or
   sheep, or both together) on plant communities under high and low plant
   diversity levels in eastern Eurasian steppe. We found that, for high
   plant diversity grassland, mixed grazing by cattle and sheep
   significantly increases plant diversity, but we found no effect of
   grazing by cattle or sheep alone. Grazing by cattle or sheep alone or
   mixed grazing by cattle and sheep did not significantly affect plant
   biomass in the high diversity grassland. However, for low plant
   diversity grassland, grazing by cattle alone and mixed grazing by cattle
   and sheep significantly increased plant diversity, but significantly
   decreased plant biomass. There was no significant impact on both plant
   diversity and biomass from sheep grazing.Synthesis and applications. We
   conclude that the effects of grazing in grassland strongly depend on
   herbivore assemblages and pre-grazing plant diversity. Herbivore grazing
   might contribute more to the maintenance of grassland structure and
   ecosystem functioning under high plant diversity compared with low plant
   diversity. Furthermore, our data suggest that multiple-species mixed
   grazing regimes in grassland systems with high plant diversity could
   represent the optimal protocol for grazing management. This study
   emphasizes the importance of maintaining both plant and herbivore

   Systems studied were classified by three main characteristics of beef
   production: origin of calves (bred by a dairy cow or a suckler cow),
   type of production (organic or non-organic) and type of diet fed to
   fattening calves (< 50\% (roughage-based) or >= 50\% (concentrate-based)

   eutrophication potential (49\% lower), energy use (23\% lower) and land
   use (49\% lower) per unit of beef for dairy-based compared with
   suckler-based systems. In suckler-based systems, maintaining the mother
   cow is the dominant contributor to all impacts, which is attributable to
   the low reproductive rate of cattle and the fact that all emissions are
   allocated to the production of beef. GWP was slightly lower (on average
   7\%) for organic compared with non-organic systems, whereas organic
   systems showed higher eutrophication potential, acidification potential
   and land use (36\%, 56\%, and 22\% higher), and lower energy use (30\%
   lower) per unit of beef produced. Except for GWP, however, these results
   should be interpreted with care because impacts were compared in few
   studies. Lower GWP (on average 28\% lower), energy use (13\% lower) and
   land use (41\% lower) per unit of beef were found for concentrate-based
   compared with roughage-based systems, whereas no clear pattern was found
   for acidification and eutrophication potential. An LCA comparison of
   beef systems that differ in type of diet, however, is limited because
   current LCA methodology does not account for the competition for land
   between humans and animals. To enhance future food supply, grassland
   less suitable for crop production, therefore, might be preferred over
   high productive cropland for direct production of animal feed.
   Furthermore, studies included in our review did not include all relevant
   impact categories, such as loss of biodiversity or water use. We
   concluded that beef production from dual-purpose cows or dairy cows
   inseminated with beef breeds show largest potential to mitigate
   environmental impacts of beef. Marginal grasslands unsuitable for dairy
   farming may be used for production of suckler-based beef to contribute
   to availability and access to animal-source food. (C) 2015 Published by

   functioning}},

Abstract = {{1. Experimental studies linking community composition to functioning are
   typically confined to small and closed micro- or mesocosms. Such
   restricted conditions may affect both species' biology and their
   environment. Yet, targeting simple features in the behaviour of species
   may circumvent these constraints. Focusing on ecological functions
   provided by dung beetles, we test whether large, open-top cages -
   MESOCLOSURES - will intercept the flight trajectories of beetles,
   thereby allowing manipulation of local community composition.
   2. MESOCLOSURES were built in both tropical forest (Brazil) and
   temperate grasslands (Finland), thus testing their general efficiency.
   Within the respective environments, we varied different aspects of
   MESOCLOSURE design: in the tropical forest, we examined the impact of
   MESOCLOSURE dimensions on exclusion efficiency, whereas in the temperate
   grassland, we assessed the potential for selectively excluding and
   including community members by different mesh sizes. In the temperate
   environment, we also went from method to application, using MESOCLOSURES
   to relate community composition to functioning under two simulated
   grazing regimes.
   3. MESOCLOSURES allowed efficient manipulation of dung beetle
   communities, maintaining dung beetle densities at intended levels in
   both temperate and tropical systems. In the tropics, the smallest cages
   (1x1m) offered the highest contrast in beetle densities inside vs.
   outside of the fence, whereas the largest cages (9x9m) offered the
   lowest. Nonetheless, densities inside cages never exceed one-fifth of
   those outside. At the temperate site, manipulations of community
   structure through mesh size yielded significant differences in
   functioning and suggested an interaction between small dung-dwelling
   species and large tunnelling species. Within cages, higher grazing was
   reflected in augmented dung removal.
   4.We conclude that MESOCLOSURES can be effectively used to study dung
   beetle functions across habitats and latitudes. As applied insights, the
   present study adds resolution to the significance of different
   functional groups of dung beetles and shows that grazing pressure may
   have an important impact on the ecosystem functions that they provide.
   Overall, this study suggests that targeted manipulation of dispersal may
   offer new solutions for linking fauna to ecosystem functions with
   minimal impact on the processes measured.}},

Abstract = {{Empirical evidence indicates a positive relationship between grassland
   phytodiversity and yield. One cause may be species' complementary use of
   available resources. The aim of this study was to investigate possible
   complementarities between grassland species with differing spatial
   arrangements of leaves. Mixtures of Trifolium pratense L., Phleum
   pratense L., Lolium perenne L., and Cichorium intybus L. or Medicago
   sativa L. and pure stands of all species were established in 2007 at
   Svalov, Sweden, in a field experiment receiving a total input of 100 kg
   N ha(-1). Community height, light transmission, yield, and species
   composition as well as species' delta C-13 signatures and N
   concentrations were measured on four mowing occasions in 2009. Species'
   delta C-13 signatures are directly affected by carbon assimilation and
   stomatal conductivity for water, and indirectly by light, nitrogen and
   water availability as well as community composition. Light transmission
   through the sward was greatest in pure stand non-legumes; mixed
   communities intercepted more light than these, albeit not generally more
   than pure legumes. Non-legume species had more depleted delta C-13
   signatures when grown in mixtures than in pure stands, but the opposite
   was true for legumes. The delta C-13 signatures generally became
   enriched with increases in light transmission (grasses and legumes), but
   not with increases in N concentration (grasses). Community composition
   affected the delta C-13 signatures of all species except C. intybus. Our
   results suggest that mixing species of contrasting leaf morphologies and
   biomass distribution contributed to (i) increased light capture by
   mixtures over pure stand non-legumes, and (ii) better light availability
   in mixed than in pure stand legumes.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Landscape heterogeneity is regarded as a key factor for maintaining
   biodiversity and ecosystem function in production landscapes. We
   investigated whether grassland sites at close vicinity to forested areas
   are more frequently used by bats. Considering that bats are important
   consumers of herbivorous insects, including agricultural pest, this is
   important for sustainable land management. Bat activity and species
   richness were assessed using repeated monitoring from May to September
   in 2010 with acoustic monitoring surveys on 50 grassland sites in the
   Biosphere Reserve Schorfheide-Chorin (North-East Germany). Using spatial
   analysis (GIS), we measured the closest distance of each grassland site
   to potentially connecting landscape elements (e.g., trees, linear
   vegetation, groves, running and standing water). In addition, we
   assessed the distance to and the percent land cover of forest remnants
   and urban areas in a 200 m buffer around the recording sites to address
   differences in the local landscape setting. Species richness and bat
   activity increased significantly with higher forest land cover in the
   200 m buffer and at smaller distance to forested areas. Moreover,
   species richness increased in proximity to tree groves. Larger amount of
   forest land cover and smaller distance to forest also resulted in a
   higher activity of bats on grassland sites in the beginning of the year
   during May, June and July. Landscape elements near grassland sites also
   influenced species composition of bats and species richness of
   functional groups (open, edge and narrow space foragers). Our results
   highlight the importance of forested areas, and suggest that
   agricultural grasslands that are closer to forest remnants might be
   better buffered against outbreaks of agricultural pest insects due to
   higher species richness and higher bat activity. Furthermore, our data
   reveals that even for highly mobile species such as bats, a very dense
   network of connecting elements within the landscape is beneficial to
   promote activity in open areas and thus assure vital ecosystem function
   in agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Local ecological communities represent the scale at which species
   coexist and share resources, and at which diversity has been
   experimentally shown to underlie stability, productivity, invasion
   resistance, and other desirable community properties. Globally,
   community diversity shows a mixture of increases and decreases over
   recent decades, and these changes have relatively seldom been linked to
   climatic trends. In a heterogeneous California grassland, we documented
   declining plant diversity from 2000 to 2014 at both the local community
   (5 m(2)) and landscape (27 km(2)) scales, across multiple functional
   groups and soil environments. Communities became particularly poorer in
   native annual forbs, which are present as small seedlings in midwinter;
   within native annual forbs, community composition changed toward lower
   representation of species with a trait indicating drought intolerance
   (high specific leaf area). Time series models linked diversity decline
   to the significant decrease in midwinter precipitation. Livestock
   grazing history, fire, succession, N deposition, and increases in exotic
   species could be ruled out as contributing causes. This finding is among
   the first demonstrations to our knowledge of climate-driven directional
   loss of species diversity in ecological communities in a natural
   (nonexperimental) setting. Such diversity losses, which may also
   foreshadow larger-scale extinctions, may be especially likely in
   semiarid regions that are undergoing climatic trends toward higher
   aridity and lower productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Forest succession in tropical pastures usually starts from
   woody vegetation patches. Patches may arise within the grass matrix at
   microsites with favourable soil conditions or through facilitation by
   established nurse plants.Aims: We report the formation of woody

   patch formation was associated with micro-scale terrain features and
   whether facilitation was important for patch initiation.Methods: The
   study was conducted in three pasture sites in the Atlantic forest domain
   of Brazil. We compared soil, terrain and species abundance patterns
   among pairs of woody patch and open pasture plots.Results: The effect of
   variation in soil physical and chemical attributes was limited. Some
   species were able to establish in the grass matrix and survive
   disturbance from grazing and fire, while other species only established
   in patches, under other already established trees or shrubs. Some of
   these species were exotics, which are commonly eliminated in restoration

Abstract = {{Capsule Reintroduced Great Bustards achieve dietary and habitat
   diversity despite living in an intensive agricultural setting.Aims To
   investigate dietary composition and habitat use of reintroduced Great
   Bustards Otis tarda released in southwest England and the impact of
   supplemental feed on autumn dietary selection.Methods Faecal samples
   were collected from a mixed group of free-ranging bustards without (July
   2012, May, September, and November 2013) and with (October and December
   2012) access to supplemental feeds. Concurrently, diurnal land use
   observations were recorded for all months but September and December.
   Composite monthly faecal samples were micro-histologically analysed to
   assess dietary composition. Year-round landscape-level habitat use was
   determined using re-sightings and satellite telemetry data for birds
   surviving more than 182 days post-release. Generalized linear models
   were used to test for differences in habitat selection across the year,
   by sex and within and outside release areas for each habitat type, and
   habitat diversity was quantified using the Shannon-Weaver Index.Results
   Dietary composition varied depending on plant availability and
   phenological stage, and invertebrates were rarely selected. Agricultural
   crops - primarily oil-seed rape, mustard, barley grass, lucerne, and
   barley seed - comprised the bulk of the diet, but grassland and weedy
   forbs were always important secondary foods (>25\%), except when
   provided extruded pellets. Monthly changes in habitat use suggest
   sex-based habitat segregation, with females living in higher habitat
   diversity settings. Grasslands were used across the year. When
   supplemental food was provided, it came to dominate dietary
   intake.Conclusion Great Bustards can adapt to an intensive agricultural
   setting, but require unrestricted access to adjacent grasslands. They
   would be best served with small-scale habitat mosaics. If supplemental
   foods are to be provided to juvenile birds, quantities must be limited
   and the birds weaned off before dispersal to maximize reintroduction

Abstract = {{Mediterranean Posidonia oceanica meadows shelter an important biomass
   and biodiversity of amphipod crustaceans that graze on epiphytes.
   However, their actual significance for ecosystem functional processes is
   hard to estimate, due to the lack of adequate data. Here, a field
   microcosm-based inclusion experiment was used to test if three of the
   dominant taxa of the amphipod community (Apherusa chiereghinii, Dexamine
   spiniventris and Gammarus spp.) could exert top-down control on seagrass
   leaf epiphytes. Influence of amphipod activity on nutrient availability
   for the host species was also investigated. All grazer taxa
   significantly reduced biomasses of erect macroalgae and erect sessile
   animals present on leaves. None of them consumed encrusting epiflora or
   epifauna. This selective top-down control could have important
   implications for the structure of the epiphytic community on leaves of
   P. oceanica, which is one of the most diverse and abundant of all
   seagrass species. Grazing activity of all taxa caused higher N content
   of seagrass leaves, likely through amphipod excretion and/or sloppy
   feeding. Since P. oceanica meadows often grow in oligotrophic zones
   where plant growth can be nutrient-limited, this N enrichment could
   enhance seagrass production. Overall, the ecological interaction between
   P. oceanica and amphipods could be seen as a facultative mutualistic
   relationship. Our results suggest that amphipod mesograzers are
   key-elements in some of the functional processes regulating these
   complex and yet endangered ecosystems, which are essential components of

Abstract = {{The Himalaya harbor rich floristic diversity which is of immense

   floristic diversity of a remote alpine valley has been studied based on
   information extracted from remotely sensed satellite data along with
   field surveys undertaken during 2008-2014. Analysis of vegetation
   information from satellite data revealed that similar to 75\% of the
   area is covered with natural vegetation which comprises lush green
   coniferous forests, alpine pastures and alpine scrub lands. With inputs
   from vegetation information extracted from satellite data, comprehensive
   field surveys were planned to document the floristic diversity of the
   region. Analysis of species composition showed a total of 285 plant
   species, belonging to 191 genera in 60 families. Of these, 250 species
   are herbs, 14 shrubs, 2 sub-shrubs and 19 trees. The dicotyledons are
   represented by 240 species, monocotyledons 30, gymnosperms 04, and
   pteriodophytes 11 species. Asteraceae is the largest family with 35
   species. During the present study, 5 species (Corydalis cashmeriana,
   Hippophae rhamnoides, Primula minutissima, Saussurea sacra and Inula
   orientalis) have been recorded for the first time from this Himalayan

   floristic studies, particularly the robustness of remotely sensed data
   in identifying areas with potentially high species richness, which would
   be otherwise difficult in a complex mountainous terrain using
   traditional floristic surveys alone. The present study is expected to

Abstract = {{Native grasslands are valued for biodiversity and supporting dormant

   revegetation of Festuca campestris grasslands may be hindered by Poa

   of these species during establishment, two greenhouse experiments were
   conducted where F. campestris seedlings were planted in monocultures or

   (3-month old) seedlings of both species, while the second experiment
   used unequal-aged seedlings (4-month-old F. campestris and 2-month-old
   P. pratensis). Seedling performance was measured in response to
   manipulations of water and nitrogen, defoliation, and plant neighbor.
   While water and nitrogen reduced the biomass and vegetative reproduction
   (tillering) of F. campestris, exposure to P. pratensis most strongly
   limited the growth of F. campestris seedlings regardless of other
   treatments. More frequent and consistent decreases in F. campestris due
   to P. pratensis were observed in older F. campestris seedlings than
   younger seedlings. Defoliation also reduced the growth of F. campestris,
   and the added presence of P. pratensis during defoliation further
   enhanced these reductions in younger, equal-aged bunchgrass seedlings.
   Overall, these results suggest that when restoring native F. campestris
   grasslands, early establishment may be improved by reducing the negative
   impacts of P. pratensis, and avoiding severe defoliation.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological restorations are predicted to increase in species diversity
   over time until they reach reference levels. However, chronosequence
   studies in grasslands often show that diversity peaks after the first
   few years and then declines over time as grasses become more dominant.
   We addressed whether bison grazing and seed additions could prevent this
   decline in diversity. Exclosures that prevented bison grazing were
   compared with grazed plots over 4 years, and seed additions were
   conducted inside and outside exclosures to test for seed and microsite
   limitations. A previous study conducted 4-months post seeding found that
   local species richness was primarily seed limited, but that grazing
   could sometimes increase seedling emergence. Here, we tested whether
   increased seedling emergence led to longer-term increases in the species
   diversity of the plant community. We found that the seed addition effect
   grew smaller and the grazing effect grew stronger over time, and that
   seed additions affected the abundance of added species only when plots
   were grazed. Grazed plots had higher species diversity and lower biomass
   and litter buildup compared to non-grazed plots. Our results suggest

Abstract = {{Biodiversity loss in Europe is caused to a large extent by agricultural
   intensification. To halt this loss, agri-environment schemes have been
   introduced to compensate farmers for (costly) biodiversity conservation
   measures. Current agri-environment schemes often consider only a few
   conservation measures which is insufficient to conserve all endangered
   biodiversity in an agricultural region. This problem is particularly
   pertinent in grasslands where many different mowing and grazing dates
   are required to protect the variety of species breeding in the grassland
   at different times. A key requirement to design agri-environment schemes
   for grassland conservation is therefore to offer specific compensation
   for more measures based on a systematic approach that calculates
   farmers' opportunity costs in relation to the timing of grassland use
   which is still lacking. This will at best attract more farmers and offer
   compensation calculated in line with EU requirements for co-financed
   measures through the Rural Development Programme. We fill this gap by
   developing a systematic approach to assess the costs of different mowing
   and grazing dates. Our approach is general enough to be applicable on a
   large spatial scale but can still sensitively differentiate among
   different timings. Moreover it is straightforward and time-saving enough
   to be suitable for implementation in regional scale optimisation
   procedures. We demonstrate this by applying the systematic cost
   assessment in the decision support software DSS-Ecopay using the example
   of grassland biodiversity conservation measures in the German federal
   state of Saxony. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by herbivores plays a key role in grassland ecosystems, but its
   effects on soil fauna biodiversity are not clear in alpine meadow
   ecosystems, especially on the Tibetan plateau. We investigated the
   effects of long-term grazing disturbance of varying intensities (low
   disturbed site, medially disturbed site, and seriously disturbed site)
   on ecosystem biodiversity and functional process using soil nematode
   communities. Soil physicochemical characteristics and plant communities
   were also measured to explore the relationships between soil nematode
   communities structure and key environment variable. Soil samples were
   collected in May, June, August, and October, 2013. The abundance of
   total nematode communities, plant feeders and bacterivores increased
   with the grazing intensity increase, and predators decreased with
   grazing intensity increase. Low disturbed site has the lowest abundance
   of fungivores. Grazing disturbance has no significant influence on
   abundance of omnivores (P > 0.05). Species richness was highest on
   seriously disturbed site and lowest on low disturbed site. MI and SI
   decreased as grazing intensity increase. The highest NCR was found in
   low disturbed site and the lowest in medially disturbed site. The
   highest El was found in medially disturbed site and the lowest in low
   disturbed site. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that nematode
   communities could be separated by three different grazing disturbance
   intensity sites. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that Helicotylenchus,
   Acrobeloides and Labronema were positively correlated with higher plant
   communities diversity. Filenchus was positively correlated with forbs
   biomass. Some omnivores such as Eudorylaimus and Aporcelaimus was
   positively correlated with soil moisture and rich nutrient resources,
   meanwhile, Enchodelus and Coomansus was positively correlated with
   biomass of sedges and grasses. Anaplectus and Prismatolaimus
   significantly correlated with soil moisture, nutrient resources and
   biomass of sedges and grasses. This study revealed that grazing
   herbivores can change composition, structure and diversity of soil
   nematode communities, and then reflect radical shift in below-ground

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{187}},
Pages = {{154-163}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Collisions with cars are an important mortality factor for many wild
   animals. Measures to mitigate road mortality are costly so should be
   implemented using cost-effective measures in locations where the road
   mortality is consistently highest and non-random in different species.
   It is thus important to identify what features causes these biodiversity
   collision blackspots. Almost all of the data and literature on
   collisions refer to vertebrates with little known about invertebrates.
   We used data on butterfly roadkills in three large landscape plots in
   Poland to identify sites where the collision rate seems to be routinely
   high. Biodiversity collision blackspots were identified from occurrence
   in successive years using spatial hierarchical clustering. Biodiversity
   collision blackspots comprised just 4\% of the total road length, but
   included 49\% of all road-killed butterflies. Habitats within 500 m of
   each blackspot was compared to random non-blackspot sites using
   generalized linear mixed models. The occurrence of blackspots was linked
   with high traffic volume, but only when cover of grassland in a
   landscape was high and verges had low plant species richness. Similarly,
   blackspots occurred with high probability when traffic volume was high
   but especially if grassland cover in the landscape and verge mowing
   frequency were also high. These blackspots had higher species richness
   and abundance of butterflies in the surrounding landscape than in random
   sites. Biodiversity collision blackspots analysis identified road
   sections of high road mortality for different butterfly species.
   Moreover, blackspots were also indication of species rich areas of
   conservation concern that were intersected by roads. Thus, conservation
   practitioners may direct mitigation measures, such as less frequent
   mowing and speed limit, in a cost-efficient manner in these
   spatially-limited locations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate calcareous grasslands are characterized by high levels of
   species richness at small spatial scales. Nevertheless, many species
   from a habitat-specific regional species pool may be absent from local
   communities and represent the dark diversity' of these sites. Here we
   investigate dry calcareous grasslands in northern Europe to determine
   what proportion of the habitat-specific species pool is realized at
   small scales (i.e. how the community completeness varies) and which
   mechanisms may be contributing to the relative sizes of the observed and
   dark diversity. We test whether the absence of particular species in
   potentially suitable grassland sites is a consequence of dispersal
   limitation and/or a low ability to tolerate stress (e.g. drought and
   grazing). We analysed a total of 1223 vegetation plots (1 x 1 m) from
   dry calcareous grasslands in Sweden, Estonia and western Russia. The
   species co-occurrence approach was used to estimate the dark diversity
   for each plot. We calculated the maximum dispersal distance for each of
   the 291 species in our dataset by using simple plant traits (dispersal
   syndrome, growth form and seed characteristics). Large seed size was
   used as proxy for small seed number; tall plant height and low
   S-strategy type scores were used to characterise low stress-tolerance.
   Levels of small-scale community completeness were relatively low (more
   species were absent than present) and varied between the grasslands in
   different geographic areas. Species in the dark diversity were generally
   characterized by shorter dispersal distances and greater seed weight
   (fewer seeds) than species in the observed diversity. Species within the
   dark diversity were generally taller and had a lower tolerance of
   stressful conditions. We conclude that, even if temperate grasslands
   have high levels of small-scale plant diversity, the majority of
   potentially suitable species in the regional species pool may be absent
   as a result of dispersal limitation and low stress-tolerance.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, livestock management in the North American Great Plains aims
   for even use of forage, which creates a homogenous landscape.
   Reintroducing heterogeneity, defined here as the variation in vegetation
   structure and composition, to native North American rangelands is
   imperative to maintaining grassland biodiversity, and using a variety of
   cattle stocking rates on the landscape could accomplish this. We
   assessed effects of stocking rates on northern mixed-grass prairie
   vegetation structure, structural heterogeneity, and plant species
   diversity. The study took place in Grasslands National Park in
   Saskatchewan, Canada, using nine pastures (similar to 300 ha) that were
   grazed at a range of stocking rates from very low to very high for this
   region. Three of these pastures were ungrazed controls. We used
   generalized linear mixed models to describe effects of stocking rate on
   vegetation over 4 years, following the reintroduction of livestock
   grazing to this landscape after 15 years without grazing. We used a
   Mantel test to determine whether plant communities changed with varying
   stocking rates and over time. Effects of grazing on many response
   variables were cumulative and changed over time. Species richness in
   uplands increased with stocking rate and time, but richness decreased
   with stocking rate in lowlands. Heterogeneity generally increased with
   stocking rate and time in upland but not lowland habitats. While natural
   annual variability influenced many variables, the cumulative effects of
   grazing were still apparent. A variety of stocking rates could be used
   to maximize structural heterogeneity and provide a diversity of habitat
   structure at the landscape scale. (C) 2015 Society for Range Management.

Abstract = {{QuestionThe consumption of plant biomass by herbivores is an important
   biotic interaction with possible cascading effects from the level of
   individual plant performance up to ecosystem functions. However, little
   is known about the degree and patterns of insect herbivory in alpine
   ecosystems. We searched for altitudinal differences in herbivory and
   tested for effects of traits of both the host plants and the surrounding
   plant communities on herbivory incidence to evaluate predictions derived
   from the resource availability and the resource concentration
   hypothesis.
   LocationHigh-altitude grasslands of the eastern European Alps.
   MethodsWe recorded insect herbivory on leaves of five plant taxa
   differing in traits related to nutritional value and anti-herbivore
   resistance to provide the first large-scale assessment of herbivory in
   high-altitude environments. Regression analyses were used to test for
   significant effects of plant community diversity, host species abundance
   and soil fertility at grasslands in the lower and upper alpine belt.
   ResultsWe found a positive correlation of the incidence of folivory with
   local plant species richness, soil fertility and local host species
   abundance. The effects of community traits were stronger at higher
   altitudes, although the overall level of herbivory was lower at higher
   altitudes. Taxa lacking strong chemical defences, but possessing either
   high nutrient or high silica content, were particularly strongly and
   weakly affected by herbivory, respectively.
   ConclusionsThese results are in line with predictions derived from the
   resource availability hypothesis, but remain ambiguous concerning the
   resource concentration hypothesis. The degree of herbivory not only
   depends on traits of hosts but also on features of the surrounding plant
   community. The generally high incidence of herbivory with low levels of
   damage suggests that insect folivores are omnipresent in high-altitude
   grasslands.}},

Volume = {{178}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{795-806}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{While the effects of drought and grazing are often studied separately,
   these disturbances co-occur in grasslands worldwide and interactively
   influence population, community, and ecosystem processes. The effects of
   drought and grazing on the belowground bud bank may dictate the
   trajectory of community recovery because new shoots arise from
   belowground buds after disturbance in perennial grasslands. We therefore
   investigated the separate and interactive effects of severe drought and
   grazing on the belowground bud bank and aboveground vegetation in the
   tallgrass prairie of northeast Kansas, USA. Contrary to our
   expectations, we observed changes in community structure and declines in
   species richness both above and below ground in response to drought and
   grazing. We also hypothesized that drought would reduce bud bank density
   of all taxonomic groups, but found that grass bud and shoot densities
   remained constant across all drought and grazing treatment combinations.
   While sedge and forb bud and shoot densities were reduced by drought,
   only sedge bud density declined to a greater extent when grazed under
   drought conditions. Live rhizome biomass did not vary by treatment and
   was highly correlated with bud bank density, suggesting that bud
   demography is tightly linked to the production and senescence of
   rhizomes. Despite the effects of drought and grazing on aboveground net
   primary productivity and community structure, our work suggests that
   grasses stabilize tallgrass prairie plant communities because their
   rhizomes and associated buds persist through co-occurring disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{In Mediterranean Europe, wood-pasture landscapes with oak woodlands as
   emblematic ecosystems are undergoing rapid land-use change, which may
   threaten their legacy as hotspots of biodiversity, ecosystem services,
   and cultural heritage. The objective of this study was to quantify land
   cover changes and transitions as well as the dynamics of oak woodland
   patterns and densities over 50 years in two municipalities at the center
   and edges of Quercus macrolepis distribution in Northern Lesvos
   (Greece). We used aerial photographs from 1960 and WorldView-2 satellite
   images from 2010 to process land cover maps and metrics, and to
   calculate oak canopy cover with a point-grid sampling approach.
   Spatiotemporal dynamics of land cover change were generally
   high-especially between oak woodlands and grass- and shrub-lands,
   resulting in a more heterogeneous and fragmented landscape in 2010.
   Surprisingly, oak woodland area remained stable with marginal losses in
   one study site and gains in the other one. Oak canopy cover increased by
   8 and 9 \%. Spatial hotspots of change were mountainous and peripheral
   phrygana areas with expanding oak stands, as well as river valleys and
   near urban areas with expanding olive groves and grass- and shrublands
   in former complex cultivation and oak stands. We conclude that the
   parallel processes of abandonment of crop cultivation and
   intensification of livestock grazing have been less detrimental to oak
   woodlands than supposed. To ensure long-term persistence of oak
   woodlands in the face of ongoing rural depopulation and land-use
   intensification, environmental and agricultural policies should better
   address their specificities as anthropogenic habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Given the recent strengthening of wetland restoration and protection
   policies in France, there is need to develop rapid assessment methods
   that provide a cost-effective way to assess losses and gains of wetland
   functions. Such methods have been developed in the US and we tested six
   of them on a selection of contrasting wetlands in the IsSre watershed.
   We found that while the methods could discriminate sites, they did not
   always give consistent rankings, thereby revealing the different
   assumptions they explicitly or implicitly incorporate. The US assessment
   methods commonly use notions of ``old-growth{''} or ``pristine{''} to
   define the benchmark conditions against which to assess wetlands. Any
   reference-based assessment developed in the US would need adaptation to
   work in the French context. This could be quite straightforward for the
   evaluation of hydrologic variables as scoring appears to be consistent
   with the best professional judgment of hydrologic condition made by a
   panel of French local experts. Approaches to rating vegetation condition
   and landscape context, however, would require substantial reworking to
   reflect a novel view of reference standard. Reference standard in the
   European context must include acknowledgement that many of the best
   condition and biologically important wetland types in France are the
   product of intensive, centuries-long management (mowing, grazing, etc.).
   They must also explicitly incorporate the recent trend in ecological
   assessment to focus particularly on the wetland's role in
   landscape-level connectivity. These context-specific, socio-cultural
   dimensions must be acknowledged and adjusted for when adapting or
   developing wetland assessment methods in new cultural contexts.}},

Abstract = {{QuestionsDoes restoration success of formerly abandoned semi-natural
   pastures depend on adjacent land use? Is species richness higher in
   restored pastures adjacent to an intact semi-natural pasture than in
   restored pastures adjacent to arable land? Does community similarity
   between a restored and an adjacent intact pasture decrease with distance
   from the border between the two pastures? Do differences in species
   richness and community similarity decrease over time?
   LocationAgricultural landscapes in south-central Sweden.
   MethodsThe plant community in previously abandoned but now restored
   semi-natural pastures was surveyed along a distance gradient from the
   border between the restored pastures and adjacent fields towards the
   centre of the pastures. The restored pastures were located adjacent to
   either a crop field (N=8) or a continuously grazed pasture (N=6), and
   differed in time since restoration (1-13yr).
   ResultsThe total species richness was higher in pastures adjoining
   continuously grazed pastures compared to crop fields. Richness of both
   total and specialist species increased with time since restoration.
   Irrespective of adjacent land use, richness of specialist species
   decreased with increasing distance from the edge, an effect that became
   weaker with increasing time since restoration. The similarity in species
   composition compared to that in adjacent continuously grazed pasture
   also decreased towards the centre of the restored pasture.
   ConclusionsOur results suggest that restoration of biodiversity in
   semi-natural pastures benefits from adjacent pastures that can act as
   source habitats. The most likely mechanism is step-wise short-distance
   dispersal, but also other processes, such as more long-distance
   dispersal, seed bank dynamics and historical legacies are probably
   involved. To best succeed in habitat restoration in fragmented
   landscapes, the spatial location of source populations must be
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat area and continuity are both key issues in conservation biology,
   for example in the choice and design of areas used as nature reserves.
   We analyzed how grazing continuity and pasture area affect species
   richness, functional groups and red-listed species of dung beetles,
   functionally important but often highly threatened organisms found in
   pasture areas. We used literature and our own field data to study a
   chronosequence of 22 pastures ranging from recently established sites up
   to 1000 years of grazing history in five European countries. Our results
   show a strong positive effect of grazing continuity on total species
   richness, especially within the first hundred years of permanent
   grazing. Species richness showed a stronger increase with grazing
   continuity in habitat specialists than in habitat generalists. However,
   the number of red-listed dung beetle species increased strongly with the
   size of a pasture, leading to higher proportions of red-listed species
   on large than on small pastures. Due to the length of time needed for
   specialist species to become established, priority should be given to
   the conservation of existing pasture areas, and new areas should ideally
   be connected to these habitats to facilitate colonization. Relatively
   large pastures (>130 ha) or a coherent network of small pastures are
   required to ensure long-term survival of red-listed dung beetles. (C)

Abstract = {{Maintaining native biodiversity in grasslands requires management and
   mitigation of anthropogenic changes that have altered resource
   availability, grazing regimes, and community composition. In California
   (USA), high levels of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition have
   facilitated the invasion of exotic grasses, posing a threat to the
   diverse plant and insect communities endemic to serpentine grasslands.
   Cattle grazing has been employed to mitigate the consequences of exotic
   grass invasion, but the ecological effects of grazing in this system are
   not fully understood. To characterize the effects of realistic N
   deposition on serpentine plant communities and to evaluate the efficacy
   of grazing as a management tool, we performed a factorial experiment
   adding N and excluding large herbivores in California's largest
   serpentine grassland. Although we observed significant interannual
   variation in community composition related to climate in our six-year
   study, exotic cover was consistently and negatively correlated with
   native plant richness. Sustained low-level N addition did not influence
   plant community composition, but grazing reduced grass abundance while
   maintaining greater native forb cover, native plant diversity, and
   species richness in comparison to plots excluding large herbivores.
   Furthermore, grazing increased the temporal stability of plant
   communities by decreasing year-to-year variation in native forb cover,
   native plant diversity, and native species richness. Taken together, our
   findings demonstrate that moderate-intensity cattle grazing can be used
   to restrict the invasive potential of exotic grasses and maintain native
   plant communities in serpentine grasslands. We hypothesize that the
   reduced temporal variability in serpentine plant communities managed by
   grazing may directly benefit populations of the threatened Edith's Bay
   checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis).}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we assessed the potential for bioenergy production of
   Low-Input High-Diversity (LIHD) systems in temperate West-European
   conservation areas. A wide range of seminatural ecosystems (wet and dry
   grasslands, marshes, tall-herb vegetation and heathlands) was sampled.
   Because LIHD biomass is often scattered and discontinuously available,
   we only considered the potential for anaerobic digestion and combustion.
   Both technologies are suitable for decentralized biomass utilization.
   The gross energy yield showed a promising range between 46-277 GJ per
   hectare per mowing cycle (MC). The energy efficiency of the anaerobic
   digestion process was rather low (10-30\%) with a methane energy yield
   of 5.5-35.5GJha(-1) MC-1, experimentally determined by batch digestion
   tests. The water content, functional group composition and biochemical
   composition (hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin and Kjeldahl nitrogen) of
   the biomass were analyzed to assess the suitability of different
   valorization pathways. On the basis of the results, we were able to
   propose recommendations regarding the appropriate conversion techniques.
   Biomass from plant communities with late' harvest dates (August-October)
   or a high fraction of woody species like heathland and dune slacks, is
   best valorized through combustion, while herbaceous biomass of early'
   harvested grasslands (June-July) and tall-herb vegetation can better be
   digested. The main advantages of the production of bioenergy from LIHD
   biomass originating from conservation management are the minimization of
   the competition with food production and its potential to reconcile
   renewable energy policies and biodiversity goals.}},

Abstract = {{Metacommunity theory predicts that increasing patch size and patch
   connectivity can alter local species diversity by affecting either
   colonization rates, extinction rates or both. Although species'
   dispersal abilities or dispersal mode' (e.g. gravity-, wind- or
   animal-dispersed seeds) can mediate the effects of patch size and
   connectivity on diversity, these important factors are frequently
   overlooked in empirical metacommunity work. We use a natural
   metacommunity of aspen stands within a grassland matrix to determine
   whether dispersal mode alters the influence of stand size and
   connectivity on understorey plant diversity. We sampled the same area in
   each patch, controlled for the presence of matrix species in aspen
   stands, and tested for the effects of size, connectivity and dispersal
   mode on metacommunity richness. Because dispersal groups responded
   differently to patch size and connectivity, we created a null model and
   assessed ungulate activity to explore whether competitive dynamics or
   herbivory were driving diversity patterns. Animal-dispersed species and
   species with no dispersal aid had higher diversity per unit area in
   larger stands, likely because large stands can both support larger
   populations that are less prone to extinction and may also attract
   seed-dispersing animals such as birds and small mammals that are
   sensitive to edge effects. Consistent with other empirical work, we
   found a positive relationship between diversity and connectivity for
   wind-dispersed species. However, we detected a negative effect of stand
   connectivity on the diversity of species with no dispersal aid, possibly
   due to the presence of other highly competitive species groups
   dominating well-connected patches, as our null model results suggest. We
   found no evidence for higher ungulate activity in highly connected
   patches, suggesting that herbivory may not be driving the decline in
   diversity of plants with no dispersal aid.Synthesis. Overall, we see a
   positive effect of stand area on diversity for most groups despite
   sampling equal area in all stands, which is a prediction of
   metacommunity theory that is normally overlooked. Our results
   demonstrate the importance of considering variation in the dispersal
   modes of focal species for explaining the diversity patterns of natural
   metacommunities.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater wetlands and marshes with extensive reed beds are important
   hotspots of biological diversity, but in the absence of proper
   management, they are subject to biotic homogenisation. We assessed the
   impact of spatiotemporally variable management by cattle grazing (for 4
   years) and late-summer burning (1 or 3 years before the study) on both
   songbirds and non-passerines in a previously homogeneous reed bed. We
   surveyed birds using a combination of line transects and point counts in
   a quasi-experimental design comprising six treatment levels. Management
   increased both the diversity of marsh habitats and the diversity of bird
   species. The species richness and abundance of non-passerines (ducks and
   geese, wading birds, gulls and terns, rails, coots and grebes) was
   higher in recently burned than in unburned or old-burned patches.
   Species richness of farmland songbirds was higher in grazed than in
   non-grazed patches, and the richness and abundance of reed songbirds was
   higher in unburned, old-burned, and grazed patches than in recently
   burned patches. Total Shannon diversity and evenness of birds was lowest
   in areas with the most intensive treatment (patches grazed and
   twice-burned), whereas Simpson diversity was highest in these areas.
   Non-managed patches had fewer species and individuals of all groups
   except reed songbirds. The proportion of old reed was low in recently
   burned and grazed patches, and was similarly high in all other treatment
   areas. No other property of reed stands was influenced by management,
   and both the allocation and the effect of management were independent of
   water level. Spatiotemporally variable management by cattle grazing and
   late-summer burning may thus simultaneously benefit several groups of
   birds. The effect of burning alone disappeared in 3 years, even in the
   presence of grazing; thus it must be repeated every 2-3 years. We
   conclude that both management actions are necessary to establish and
   maintain highly diverse habitats for marshland bird communities.}},

Abstract = {{Land degradation is a complex concept that integrates different aspects,
   including changes in soil conditions, biodiversity, productivity and
   socio-economic implications, compared to a reference state. We propose a
   new conceptual framework to analyze degradation stages and restoration
   thresholds in species-rich natural grasslands. The framework integrates
   different degradation stages with their respective thresholds and
   describes key processes of land-use change that lead to certain stages
   and thresholds. Specifically, we discuss two scenarios of grassland
   degradation, i.e. unsuitable grassland management and complete change of
   land use, sometimes followed by spontaneous recovery. We illustrate the
   framework with the case of south Brazilian grasslands, which are rich in
   biodiversity, but suffer from a series of degradation processes and are
   poorly considered from a conservation perspective. The conceptual
   framework can be applied by studies on degradation and restorability of
   tropical and subtropical grasslands after changes in management or
   transition to other land use; it will facilitate decisions on
   alternative management and conservation. (C) 2015 Associacao Brasileira

Abstract = {{The effects of herbivores and their interactions with nutrient

   grassland systems is expected to vary with herbivore type. We examined
   the effects of invertebrate and small vertebrate herbivores and their
   interactions with nutrient availability on grassland plant community
   composition and aboveground biomass in a tallgrass prairie ecosystem.
   The abundance of forbs relative to grasses increased with invertebrate
   herbivore removals. This increase in forb abundance led to a shift in
   community composition, where invertebrate removals resulted in greater
   plant species evenness as well as a divergence in composition among
   plots. In contrast, vertebrate herbivore removals did not affect plant
   community composition or aboveground biomass. Nutrient additions alone
   resulted in a decrease in plant species richness and an increase in the
   abundance of the dominant grass, but the dominant grass species did not
   greatly increase in abundance when nutrient additions were combined with
   invertebrate removals. Rather, several subdominant forbs came to
   dominate the plant community. Additionally, the combined nutrient
   addition and invertebrate herbivore removal treatment increased forb
   biomass, suggesting that invertebrate herbivores suppress the responses
   of forb species to chronic nutrient additions. Overall, the release of
   forbs from invertebrate herbivore pressure may result in large shifts in

   forage quality due to altered grass: forb ratios in grassland systems.}},

Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{Overgrazing is considered one of the key disturbance factors that
   results in alpine grassland degradation in Tibet. Grazing exclusion by
   fencing has been widely used as an approach to restore degraded
   grasslands in Tibet since 2004. Is the grazing exclusion management
   strategy effective for the vegetation restoration of degraded alpine
   grasslands? Three alpine grassland types were selected in Tibet to
   investigate the effect of grazing exclusion on plant community structure
   and biomass. Our results showed that species biodiversity indicators,
   including the Pielou evenness index, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index,
   and the Simpson dominance index, did not significantly change under
   grazing exclusion conditions. In contrast, the total vegetation cover,
   the mean vegetation height of the community, and the aboveground biomass
   were significantly higher in the grazing exclusion grasslands than in
   the free grazed grasslands. These results indicated that grazing
   exclusion is an effective measure for maintaining community stability
   and improving aboveground vegetation growth in alpine grasslands.
   However, the statistical analysis showed that the growing season
   precipitation (GSP) plays a more important role than grazing exclusion
   in which influence on vegetation in alpine grasslands. In addition,
   because the results of the present study come from short term(6-8 years)
   grazing exclusion, it is still uncertain whether these improvements will
   be continuable if grazing exclusion is continuously implemented.
   Therefore, the assessments of the ecological effects of the grazing
   exclusion management strategy on degraded alpine grasslands in Tibet
   still need long term continued research.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: The Araucaria Forest is associated with the Atlantic Forest
   domain and is a typical ecosystem of southern Brazil. The expansion of
   Araucaria angustifolia had a human influence in southern Brazil, where
   historically hunter-gatherer communities used the pinhao, araucaria's
   seed, as a food source. In the north of the state of Santa Catarina, the
   Araucaria Forest is a mosaic composed of cultivation and pasture
   inserted between forest fragments, where pinhao and erva-mate are
   gathered; some local communities denominate these forest ecotopes as
   caivas. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand how human
   populations transform, manage and conserve landscapes using the case
   study of caivas from the Araucaria Forests of southern Brazil, as well
   as to evaluate the local ecological knowledge and how these contribute
   to conservation of the Araucaria Forest.
   Methods: This study was conducted in the northern plateau of the state
   of Santa Catarina, Brazil in local five communities. To assess
   ethnoecological perceptions the historical use and management of caivas,
   semi-structured interviews, checklist interviews and guided tours were
   conducted with family units.
   Results: In total 28 family units participated in the study that had
   caivas on their properties. During the course of the study two main
   perceptions of the ecotope caiva were found, there is no consensus to
   the exact definition; perception of caivas is considered a gradient. In
   general caivas are considered to have the presence of cattle feeding on
   native pasture, with denser forest area that is managed, and the
   presence of specific species. Eleven management practices within caivas
   were found, firewood collection, cattle grazing, trimming of the
   herbaceous layer, and erva-mate extraction were the most common. Caivas
   are perceived and defined through the management practices and native
   plant resources. All participants stated that there have been many
   changes to the management practices within caivas and to the caiva
   itself.
   Conclusions: These areas still remain today due to cultural tradition,
   use and management of plant resources. Through this cultural tradition
   of maintaining caivas the vegetation of the Araucaria Forest has been
   conserved associated to the use of the Araucaria Forests native plant
   resources.}},

Abstract = {{Since the early 1980s, Beavers' Meadow in Barbour County, West Virginia,
   has been well known for large populations of the orchids Cleistes
   bifaria and Platanthera ciliaris. Seven taxa of special concern in West
   Virginia were present at that time: Andropogon glomeratus var.
   glomeratus, Athyrium filix-femina subsp. angustum, C. bifaria,
   Rhynchospora recognita, Sericocarpus linifolius, Scleria triglomerata,
   and Xyris torta. We present a description of the 7.4-ha meadow today, an
   inventory of its species, and some comparisons to the flora as it was
   reported 26 years ago. Collections were first made in June 2007;
   parallel transects approximately every 3-5 m were walked once each in
   May and June 2009, twice monthly in July through September 2009, and
   once each in May and June 2010. Additional specimens were collected in
   2011, 2013, and 2014. We identified 320 vascular plant taxa in 192
   genera and 67 families. The taxon list includes 31 county records and
   one state record, Scleria verticillata. All seven species of concern
   documented 26 years ago were observed between 2007 and 2014. Three
   additional state-rare species were found: Calopogon tuberosus var.
   tuberosus, Pycnanthemum torrei, and Spiranthes lucida. Exotic taxa
   numbered 65, making up 20.3\% of the flora. Establishment and
   maintenance of the diverse flora has probably been promoted by
   hydrologic gradients, low nutrient levels, and various anthropogenic
   activities, including annual rotary mowing that took place from the
   1950s through 2003 and resumed in 2009.}},

Abstract = {{In landscape mosaics, species may use different vegetation types or be
   restricted to a single vegetation type or land-use feature highlighting
   the importance of the interaction of species requirements and
   environmental heterogeneity. In these systems, the determination of the
   overall pattern of beta-diversity can indicate the importance of the
   environmental heterogeneity on diversity patterns. Here, we evaluate
   leaf beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) as habitat quality
   bioindicators in a system with varying intensities of human impacts and
   different phyto-physiognomies (from open field to forests). We collected
   1117 leaf beetles belonging to 245 species, of which 12 species and 5
   genus were considered possible bioindicators based on IndVal measures.
   Higher species richness was observed in forests and regenerating fields,
   and habitats with lower species richness included pastures, mines, and
   veredas. Natural fields, regenerating fields, natural cerrado, and
   forest had higher values of beta-diversity. Bioindicator systems that
   include not only species richness and abundance but also assemblage
   composition are needed to allow for a better understanding of
   Chrysomelidae response to environmental disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Beyond grazing, managed grasslands provide ecological services that may
   offer economic incentives for multifunctional use. Increasing
   biodiversity of plant communities may maximize net primary production by
   optimizing utilization of available light, water, and nutrient
   resources; enhance production stability in response to climatic stress;
   reduce invasion of exotic species; increase soil OM; reduce nutrient
   leaching or loading in surface runoff; and provide wildlife habitat.
   Strategically managed grazing may increase biodiversity of cool-season
   pastures by creating disturbance in plant communities through herbivory,
   treading, nutrient cycling, and plant seed dispersal. Soil OM will
   increase carbon and nutrient sequestration and water-holding capacity of
   soils and is greater in grazed pastures than nongrazed grasslands or
   land used for row crop or hay production. However, results of studies
   evaluating the effects of different grazing management systems on soil
   OM are limited and inconsistent. Although roots and organic residues of
   pasture forages create soil macropores that reduce soil compaction,
   grazing has increased soil bulk density or penetration resistance
   regardless of stocking rates or systems. But the effects of the duration
   of grazing and rest periods on soil compaction need further evaluation.
   Because vegetative cover dissipates the energy of falling raindrops and
   plant stems and tillers reduce the rate of surface water flow, managing
   grazing to maintain adequate vegetative cover will minimize the effects
   of treading on water infiltration in both upland and riparian locations.
   Through increased diversity of the plant community with alterations of
   habitat structure, grazing systems can be developed that enhance habitat
   for wildlife and insect pollinators. Although grazing management may
   enhance the ecological services provided by grasslands, environmental
   responses are controlled by variations in climate, soil, landscape
   position, and plant community resulting in considerable spatial and
   temporal variation in the responses. Furthermore, a single grazing
   management system may not maximize livestock productivity and each of
   the potential ecological services provided by grasslands. Therefore,
   production and ecological goals must be integrated to identify the
   optimal grazing management system.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change models are predicting increased frequency and severity of
   droughts in arid and semiarid environments, and these areas are
   responsible for much of the world's livestock production. Because cattle
   (Bos taurus) grazing can impact the abundance, distribution, and
   ecological function of native plant and animal communities, it is
   important to understand how cattle might respond to increasingly arid
   conditions. Here, we evaluate changes in habitat selection by cattle
   across an 8-yr period as a function of rainfall and other environmental
   covariates. Using resource selection functions, we evaluated habitat
   selection based on 2 behaviors, stationary and mobile. Models revealed
   similarity in cattle habitat selection across years, with only modest
   changes in selection as a function of precipitation, despite marked
   seasonal and interannual differences in rainfall. Cattle preferred
   gentle slopes, forest edges, wet meadows, and areas near water as well
   as areas far from water on plateaus. Cattle avoided areas at
   intermediate distances from water, typically associated with steep
   slopes. As conditions became drier during the late season, cattle did
   not switch selection patterns but instead contracted their selection
   around water. Cattle also selected similar habitats whether they were
   mobile or stationary, possibly making microsite decisions therein. This
   consistent pattern of selection across years could be particularly
   problematic for riparian communities as climates become drier; however,
   it may also simplify cattle management, as range managers can focus
   vegetation monitoring efforts on riparian areas. Due to the uncertainty
   surrounding future climatic conditions, it is imperative that both range
   and wildlife managers develop long-term plans to continue managing these
   multiuse landscapes in an ecologically sustainable manner based on
   expected patterns of livestock grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Demand for animal products is growing faster than for any other

   on cultivated pastures. We review multiple herbivore species (MHS)
   ecology in natural ecosystems (rangeland and wildlife parks) for
   guidelines to implementing this approach in cultivated pasture. In
   rangeland or natural grassland systems, sequential or simultaneous
   introduction of MHS results in greater productivity, diversity and

   mono-ruminant systems with MHS or classes on cultivated pasture is
   currently beyond landowner experience and will stretch cultivated

Abstract = {{We determined how the vegetation and spatial heterogeneity (spatial

   grasslands are affected by soil salinity level, and whether the Grime's
   hypothesis regarding species richness is accepted, to understand
   vegetation on salinized soil. To address these questions, we surveyed
   three grassland sites in Inner Mongolia. All sites had been degraded
   heavily by livestock grazing, and had different salinity levels: heavy
   (electrical conductivity 1.18-8.15dSm(-1)), intermediate
   (0.38-0.70dSm(-1)) and non-salinized (0.07-0.20dSm(-1)). We set 50
   square quadrats (0.25m(2) per quadrat), divided into four sub-quadrats
   (0.0625m(2) each), along two 25m transects in each site, and recorded
   all plant species in each sub-quadrat. The species richness of the sites
   per 0.25m(2) was in the order: intermediate salinity > non-salinized >
   heavy salinity. At the heavy and intermediate sites, the spatial
   heterogeneity of vegetation per sub-quadrat was higher than expected
   from a random pattern, but not at the non-salinized site. At the heavily
   salinized site, the spatial patterns of two halophytes with the highest
   occurrences drove the high spatial heterogeneity in species richness. In
   contrast, at the non-salinized site, two low-level halophytes with the
   highest occurrences determined the random pattern. The intermediate
   salinity site, where high- and low-level halophytes could coexist in
   accordance with small-scale spatial changes in salinity, had the highest
   species richness with relatively high spatial heterogeneity (which
   accepted the Grime's hypothesis). Our working hypothesis for remediating
   vegetation and soil in salinized grasslands is to inhibit grazing, and
   to grow species that accumulate organic matter in soil. For this,

Abstract = {{Management practices can disturb ecological communities in grazing
   lands, which represent one-quarter of land surface. But three knowledge
   gaps exist regarding disturbances: disturbances potentially interact but
   are most often studied singly; experiments with multiple ecosystems as
   treatment units are rare; and relatively new metrics of phylogenetic
   community structure have not been widely applied. We addressed all three
   of these needs with a factorial experiment; 40 seasonal wetlands
   embedded in a Florida ranch were treated with pasture intensification,
   cattle exclosure, and prescribed fire. Treatment responses were
   evaluated through four years for aquatic beetle (Coleoptera: Adephaga)
   assemblages using classic ecological metrics (species richness,
   diversity) and phylogenetic community structure (PCS) metrics. Adephagan
   assemblages consisted of 23 genera representing three families in a
   well-resolved phylogeny. Prescribed fire significantly reduced diversity
   one year post-fire, followed by a delayed pasture x fire interaction.
   Cattle exclosure significantly reduced one PCS metric after one year and
   a delayed pasture x fence x fire interaction was detected with another
   PCS metric. Overall, effects of long-term pasture intensification were
   modified by cattle exclosure and prescribed fire. Also, PCS metrics
   revealed effects otherwise undetected by classic ecological metrics.
   Management strategies (e.g., ``flash grazing,{''} prescribed fires) in
   seasonal wetlands may successfully balance economic gains from high
   forage quality with ecological benefits of high wetland diversity in
   otherwise simplified grazing lands. Effects are likely taxon specific;
   multiple taxa should be similarly evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use intensification is a key driver of biodiversity change.
   However, little is known about how it alters relationships between the
   diversities of different taxonomic groups, which are often correlated
   due to shared environmental drivers and trophic interactions. Using data
   from 150 grassland sites, we examined how land-use intensification
   (increased fertilization, higher livestock densities, and increased
   mowing frequency) altered correlations between the species richness of
   15 plant, invertebrate, and vertebrate taxa. We found that 54\% of
   pairwise correlations between taxonomic groups were significant and
   positive among all grasslands, while only one was negative. Higher
   land-use intensity substantially weakened these correlations(35\%
   decrease in rand 43\% fewer significant pairwise correlations at high
   intensity), a pattern which may emerge as a result of biodiversity
   declines and the breakdown of specialized relationships in these
   conditions. Nevertheless, some groups (Coleoptera, Heteroptera,
   Hymenoptera and Orthoptera) were consistently correlated with
   multidiversity, an aggregate measure of total biodiversity comprised of
   the standardized diversities of multiple taxa, at both high and
   lowland-use intensity. The form of intensification was also important;
   increased fertilization and mowing frequency typically weakened
   plant-plant and plant-primary consumer correlations, whereas grazing
   intensification did not. This may reflect decreased habitat
   heterogeneity under mowing and fertilization and increased habitat
   heterogeneity under grazing. While these results urge caution in using
   certain taxonomic groups to monitor impacts of agricultural management
   on biodiversity, they also suggest that the diversities of some groups
   are reasonably robust indicators of total biodiversity across a range of
   conditions.}},

Title = {{Indirect interactions in terrestrial plant communities: emerging
   patterns and research gaps}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Indirect interactions occur when the effect of one species on another is
   mediated by a third species. These interactions occur in most
   multi-species assemblages and are diverse in their mechanistic pathways.
   The interest in indirect interactions has increased exponentially over
   the past three decades, in recognition of their importance in
   determining plant community dynamics and promoting species coexistence.
   Here, we review the literature on indirect interactions among plants
   published since 1990, using a novel synthetic framework that accounts
   for and classifies intervening species and mechanisms within trophic
   networks. The objectives of this review are: (1) to identify the
   geographical regions and ecosystem types where indirect interactions
   have been examined; (2) to summarize the information on the number of
   trophic levels examined in studies of indirect interactions; (3) to test
   whether the frequency of indirect interactions varies across
   environmental gradients; and (4) to identify the experimental approaches
   most commonly used in studies of indirect interactions. Studies
   examining indirect interactions in plants have been conducted primarily
   in the Northern Hemisphere, with a focus on grasslands and forests. The
   majority of studies (67\%) examined two trophic levels. Indirect
   facilitation and apparent competition are the interactions that have
   been most frequently examined, with the latter being reported more
   frequently in relatively productive environments. Other indirect
   interactions reported include associational resistance, exploitative
   competition or facilitation, shared defenses, and trophic cascades.
   Generally, field experiments tested indirect interactions based on
   single target species. While the majority of studies on indirect
   interactions dealt with basic ecology issues, several studies have dealt
   with such interactions in the context of biological invasions (18\%) and
   rangeland management (12\%). This review allowed us identifying a number
   of research needs, including the study of non-feeding interactions and
   that for more realistic complex designs, explicitly testing indirect
   interactions across different trophic levels, in geographical regions
   that have been under-examined to date, and in stressful ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Calcareous grasslands are one of the most species-rich semi-natural
   habitat types. However, area and species richness have considerably
   decreased, particularly due to the cessation of grazing or mowing.
   Accordingly, habitat restoration has become an important issue in the
   conservation of these grasslands. The aim of this study was to analyse
   the role of shrub cutting as a measure to restore habitats of the target
   butterfly Satyrium spini (Denis and Schiffermuller 1775) on formerly
   abandoned calcareous grasslands. We compared host plant density and
   occupancy, as well as egg batch density and size between cut, regularly
   managed and fallow patches. In total, we counted 3372 Rhamnus cathartica
   host plants on 17 calcareous grassland patches. On 309 (9 \%) of these
   plants, we found a total of 490 batches containing 1168 eggs. Both R.
   cathartica and S. spini responded rapidly to restoration: Shrub cutting
   promoted the rejuvenation of the host plant, resulting in a strong
   population increase of the butterfly species four years after shrub
   cutting. The density of the preferred small host plants (growth height <
   130 cm), their occupancy, as well as the density and size of the batches
   on these plants, clearly exceeded those of small plants on fallow and
   even on traditionally managed calcareous grasslands. Based on this
   study, we recommend shrub cutting on calcareous grasslands as both a
   restorative and regular management measure for S. spini habitats. Due to
   the increasing demand for fuel wood, shrub cutting in overgrown
   grasslands might even no longer be constrained by economic reasons.}},

   and December 2010 using standardized transect walk methods. In
   comparison to the natural savannah, cornfields exhibited lower numbers
   and densities of grasshopper species, while ruderal areas exhibited
   similar species richness. However, vegetation cover was the best
   predictor for species richness, with the number of grasshopper species
   nearly doubling from plots with scarce vegetation to those with a dense
   grass cover. The composition of grasshopper communities differed between
   land use types and vegetation cover, with habitat generalists being
   scarce. Therefore, the species richness of all land use types combined
   was considerably higher than the richness of single land use types. We
   found no rare or threatened species during sampling. Our study suggests
   that a mosaic agricultural landscape with areas of savannah and
   extensively managed ruderal areas may maintain a high biodiversity of
   grasshoppers. However, the effectiveness of such mosaics is strongly
   dependent on extensive farm management practises which retain
   significant amounts of grass cover throughout the year.}},

Abstract = {{Human disturbance, natural environmental conditions and seed dispersal
   are often inferred as important drivers of plant community richness and
   diversity in wetland ecosystems. However, plant functional groups within
   a plant community have different environmental requirements and may
   respond differently to human disturbance. Therefore, the understanding
   of the relative importance of these variables in determining community
   and functional groups richness and diversity is important for improved
   management and wise use of wetland resources. We collected data on
   vegetation and environmental conditions, human disturbance and seed
   dispersal from 60 plots of 20 x 50 m, to identify variables that
   potentially affect total species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity
   of the grassland plant community at the Kilombero Valley wetland,
   Tanzania. We further tested whether important predictor variables for
   species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity differ among graminoid,
   forb and shrub functional groups. Overall, our results suggest that
   environmental conditions, human disturbance and seed dispersal determine
   spatial variation in species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity of
   the grassland vegetation. The total richness and Shannon-Wiener
   diversity and the richness of shrubs decreased with distance from the
   Kilombero River, whereas the total Shannon-Wiener diversity and the
   Shannon-Wiener diversity of graminoids decreased with the increase in
   grazing intensity. Shrub species richness was related to the spatial
   position of plots and decreased with total organic carbon of soil.
   Current increase in human disturbances through cattle husbandry and
   changes in natural environmental conditions (e.g. through water
   diversion and drainage) should be discouraged in order to restore and
   sustain biodiversity of the Kilombero wetland.}},

Abstract = {{Large mammalian herbivores are key drivers of grazed community structure
   especially through their selective grazing which requires animals to
   discriminate between food items. The impact of local plant diversity on
   selective grazing is however largely unknown. We investigated the
   ability of sheep to discriminate between plant species within a patch

   grassland species: perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne), tall fescue
   (Festuca arundinacea), narrow-leaf plantain (Plantago lanceolata) and
   yarrow (Achillea millefolium). This made it possible to vary two factors
   likely to decrease sheep discrimination ability: plant species richness
   and degree of resemblance. Patch species richness only slightly
   decreased sheep selectivity for ryegrass. Sheep preferred plantain and
   avoided yarrow relative to ryegrass, confirming that they can
   discriminate these species at a fine scale. Contrary to previous
   surveys, sheep did not select ryegrass over fescue, which suggests that
   species resemblance impaired within-patch discrimination. The degree of
   species similarity would thus interact with the local distribution of
   resources so that either positive or negative effects of neighbouring
   plants can be observed on selection for a focal plant species. This
   highlights the importance of improving our knowledge of how grazers

Abstract = {{Potential habitat modeling of endemic species is an appropriate method
   to maintain biodiversity, ecosystem function and rehabilitation of
   rangeland ecosystems. Astragalus caragana, A. cyclophyllon and A.
   podolobus are endemic in Iran's rangelands and some neighboring
   countries. The three native species could endure environmental stresses
   due to their distinctive ecophysiological characteristics. They play
   important roles in sustainable pastures production, recreation and
   improvement. They suffer severe threat from many factors including;
   grazing, agriculture and invasive exotic species. We analyzed the
   potential habitat of three native plant species in central Iran basing
   on the grid map with the resolution of 1-km. We used inventory records
   from field surveys, herbarium collections and 22 environmental factors
   to explore the environmental influences on given species distribution by
   Maximum entropy (Maxent) model. Maxent is a species distribution model
   that uses species occurrence and environmental data for predicting
   potential species. The results of our study indicated species occurrence
   has strong correlation with environmental factors such as mean
   temperature of wettest season, elevation and precipitation of coldest
   season. We evaluated the model accuracy by AUC (area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve) based on an independent test data set.
   AUC values indicated the high power of Maxent to create potential
   habitat map (AUC (A. caragana) =0.988, AUC (A. cyclophyllon) =0.927, AUC
   (A. podolobus) =0.923). It is important to consider that AUC values tend
   to be lower for species that have broad distribution scope, such as A.
   podolobus distribution. Most suitable potential habitat distributions of
   the three species were predicted in the western and southwestern parts
   of rangelands in Isfahan province. Visual comparisons of the actual
   distribution map of the three species with produced Maxent maps
   represent a good agreement. In general, the model demonstrated that the
   occurrence of the given species is highly probable when the elevation is
   between 2,200 and 3,000 m and mean temperature of wettest season less
   than 3A degrees C. This model, therefore, can be applied to recognize
   potential sites for rangeland reclamation projects.}},

Abstract = {{United States energy policy mandates increased use of renewable fuels.
   Restoring grasslands could contribute to a portion of this requirement
   through biomass harvest for bioenergy use. We investigated which plant
   community characteristics are associated with differences in biomass
   yield from a range of realistic native prairie plantings (n = 11; i.e.,
   conservation planting, restoration, and wildlife cover). Our primary
   goal was to understand whether patterns in plant community composition
   and the Floristic Quality Index (FQI) were related to productivity as
   evidenced by dormant season biomass yield. FQI is an objective measure
   of how closely a plant community represents that of a pre-European
   settlement community. Our research was conducted in planted fields of
   native tallgrass prairie species, and provided a gradient in floristic
   quality index, species richness, species diversity, and species evenness
   in south-central Wisconsin during 2008 and 2009. We used a network of 15
   randomly located 1 m(2) plots within each field to characterize the
   plant community and estimate biomass yield by clipping the plots at the
   end of each growing season. While plant community composition and
   diversity varied significantly by planting type, biomass yield did not
   vary significantly among planting types (ANOVA; P > 0.05). Biomass yield
   was positively correlated with plant community evenness, richness, C4
   grass cover, and floristic quality index, but negatively correlated with
   plant species diversity in our multi-season multiple linear mixed
   effects models. Concordantly, plots with biomass yield in the lowest
   quartile (biomass yield <3500 kh/ha) had 8\% lower plant community
   evenness and 9\% lower FQI scores than those in the upper quartile
   (biomass yield > 5800 kh/ha). Our results suggest that promoting the
   establishment of fields with high species evenness and floristic quality
   may increase biomass yield, while simultaneously supporting

Volume = {{303}},

Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Changes in land-use are supposed to be among the severest prospective
   threats to plant diversity worldwide. In semi-natural temperate
   grasslands, the cessation of traditional land use like livestock grazing
   is considered to be one of the most important drivers of the diversity
   loss witnessed within the last decades. Despite of the enormous number
   of studies on successional pathways following grazing abandonment there
   is no general pattern of how grassland communities are affected in terms
   of diversity, trait composition and pace of succession. To gain a
   comprehensive picture is difficult given the heterogeneity of
   environments and the time and effort needed for long-term
   investigations. We here use a proven individual- and trait-based
   grassland community model to analyze short- and long-term consequences
   of grazing abandonment under different assumptions of resource
   availability, pre-abandonment grazing intensity and regional isolation
   of communities.
   Grazing abandonment led to a decrease of plant functional type (PFT)
   diversity in all but two scenarios in the long-term. In short-term we
   also found an increase or no change in Shannon diversity for several
   scenarios. With grazing abandonment we overall found an increase in
   maximum plant mass, clonal integration and longer lateral spread, a
   decrease in rosette plant types and in stress tolerant plants, as well
   as an increase in grazing tolerant and a decrease in grazing avoiding
   plant types. Observed changes were highly dependent on the regional
   configuration of communities, prevalent resource conditions and land use
   intensity before abandonment. While long-term changes took around 10-20
   years in resource rich conditions, new equilibria established in
   resource poor conditions only after 30-40 years.
   Our results confirm the potential threats caused by recent land-use
   changes and the assumption that oligotrophic communities are more
   resistant than mesotrophic communities also for long-term abandonment.
   Moreover, results revealed that species-rich systems are not per se more
   resistant than species-poor grasslands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Effects of Reduced Summer Precipitation on Productivity and Forage
   Quality of Floodplain Meadows at the Elbe and the Rhine River}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Floodplain meadows along rivers are semi-natural habitats and depend on
   regular land use. When used non-intensively, they offer suitable
   habitats for many plant species including rare ones. Floodplains are
   hydrologically dynamic ecosystems with both periods of flooding and of
   dry conditions. In German floodplains, dry periods may increase due to
   reduced summer precipitation as projected by climate change scenarios.
   Against this background, the question arises, how the forage quantity
   and quality of these meadows might change in future.
   Methods
   We report results of two field trials that investigated effects of
   experimentally reduced summer precipitation on hay quantity and quality
   of floodplain meadows at the Rhine River (2011-2012) and at two Elbe
   tributaries (2009-2011). We measured annual yield, the amount of hay
   biomass, and contents of crude protein, crude fibre, energy, fructan,
   nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
   Results
   The annual yield decreased under precipitation reduction at the Rhine
   River. This was due to reduced productivity in the second cut hay at the
   Rhine River in which, interestingly, the contents of nitrogen and crude
   protein increased. The first cut at the Rhine River was unaffected by
   the treatments. At the Elbe tributaries, the annual yield and the hay
   quantity and quality of both cuts were only marginally affected by the
   treatments.
   Conclusion
   We conclude that the yield of floodplain meadows may become less
   reliable in future since the annual yield decreased under precipitation
   reduction at the Rhine River. However, the first and agriculturally more
   important cut was almost unaffected by the precipitation reduction,
   which is probably due to sufficient soil moisture from winter/spring. As
   long as future water levels of the rivers will not decrease during
   spring, at least the use of the hay from the first cut of floodplain
   meadows appears reliable under climate change.}},

Abstract = {{Several riparian plant community and streambank metrics were evaluated
   in 5 streams subject to grazing on public lands in central eastern
   Idaho. In this study, we evaluated 3 attributes associated with the
   ground cover on streambanks: percent cover of live vegetation, litter,
   and bare ground; and we evaluated 4 attributes that describe the
   vegetation community: plant species richness, wetland index value,
   percent cover of forbs, and percent cover of graminoids. We were
   particularly interested in how these attributes differed between grazed
   and ungrazed sites, how the attributes changed through time, and
   ultimately how the attributes were able to discriminate the effects of
   livestock grazing. We found that 2 metrics, percent live vegetation and
   bare ground, consistently reflected a seasonal effect of grazing. Litter
   cover also consistently reflected overall seasonal differences, but
   results often were not significant. Results for species richness
   suggested this metric may be most applicable when measured at the end of
   the grazing season. In contrast, we found that the wetland index values
   and percent cover of graminoids and forbs inconsistently reflected
   changes in vegetation due to grazing through the growing season. Future
   work should assess these attributes over several years to determine
   whether they are better able to discern multiyear trends than current
   status. By understanding which metrics change over the season and
   whether they change consistently among riparian areas, land managers can
   determine which metrics are suitable for short-and long-term monitoring
   of riparian plant communities. A better understanding of the metrics
   used to measure cattle grazing may help managers act to improve riparian
   areas while simultaneously providing ranchers options to graze these
   sensitive ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The plant and insect communities of many summer pastures in the Swiss
   Alps are changing as they become encroached by woody plants. To
   understand the implications for overall biodiversity, we need to
   determine how different taxonomic groups respond to shrub encroachment.
   We investigated effects of encroachment upon species diversity of
   vascular plants, butterflies, and grasshoppers on two subalpine pastures
   (Mesocco and Guarda). On each site, we recognized a sequence of
   vegetation types representing a gradient of increasing shrub cover. The
   number of rare plant species was strongly affected by the degree of
   encroachment, with areas dominated by either dwarf shrubs or Alnus
   viridis having fewer species than areas of open grassland. In the
   Mesocco site, we also found differences in other measures of plant
   species richness (total species richness, number of herbaceous species)
   and in the number of grasshopper species. While plant richness was
   highest in grassland-dominated vegetation types, the species richness of
   grasshoppers was highest in types with a low to intermediate cover of
   dwarf shrubs. We found no effect of shrub cover upon butterfly species
   richness at either site. Biotic factors (shrub cover, grazing intensity,
   and also vegetation-related variables for the insect groups) explained a
   larger proportion of the variance in species composition of both plants
   and insects than did large-scale abiotic factors (altitude, aspect, and
   slope). Our results demonstrate that shrub encroachment is a threat to
   the biodiversity of subalpine grassland ecosystems. We recommend
   conservation actions that prevent extensive shrub encroachment but

Abstract = {{In order to intensify cattle utilization, embankments were constructed
   to avoid tidal ingressions in Samborombon Bay, Argentina, The objective
   of this study was to evaluate the effect of tidal suppression and
   cutting-frequency of a-salt marsh dominated-by Spartina densiflora
   Brongn. Two paddocks of-a commercial cow-calf operation farm, one
   prevented from tidal flooding and another exposed to overflow from
   natural tidal pattern (control), were the main plots of the nested
   design. The experiments were carried out during a dry (2008-2009) and a
   wet growing season (2012-2013). Two defoliation frequencies, simulating
   light and moderate grazing pressure, were performed in the subplots
   nested within each main plot. Soil organic matter and N content were
   lower and soil structural instability index was much higher in the
   embankment than in the control treatment. Soil salinity during the dry
   growing season was higher in the embankment than in the control
   treatment. Bare soil was higher under embankment treatment and high
   defoliation frequency exacerbated this response. Relative contribution
   of Spartina densiflora was lower under embankment than control treatment
   and the changes of floristic composition depended on the growing season.
   Aboveground net primary production (ANPP) in the wet growing season was
   almost 70\% higher than in the dry growing season. Embankment reduced
   ANPP and high defoliation increased ANPP with respect to low defoliation
   frequency in the control paddock, to a much higher extent in the wet
   season. Dry matter digestibility of S. densiflora was not affected by
   treatments. Crude protein was higher in control paddocks under high
   frequency. Our results showed that tidal suppression by embankment was
   not effective to increase productivity and forage value of S. densiflora
   saltmarsh but caused soil and structural changes that may negatively
   alter ecosystem processes of this vulnerable grassland of high
   importance for biodiversity conservation. (C) 2015 Society for Range

Title = {{Long-term agricultural land-cover change and potential for cropland
   expansion in the former Virgin Lands area of Kazakhstan}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{During the SovietVirgin Lands Campaign, approximately 23million hectares
   (Mha) of Eurasian steppe grassland were converted into cropland in
   Northern Kazakhstan from 1954 to 1963. As a result Kazakhstan became an
   important breadbasket of the former Soviet Union. However, the collapse
   of the Soviet Union in 1991 triggered widespread agricultural
   abandonment, and much cropland reverted to grasslands. Our goal in this
   study was to reconstruct and analyze agricultural land-cover change
   since the eve of the Virgin Lands Campaign, from 1953 to 2010 in
   Kostanay Province, a region that is representative of Northern
   Kazakhstan. Further, we assessed the potential of currently idle
   cropland for re-cultivation. Wereconstructed the cropland extent before
   and after the Virgin Lands Campaign using archival maps, and we mapped
   the agricultural land cover in the late Soviet and post-Soviet period
   using multi-seasonal Landsat TM/ETM+ images from circa 1990, 2000 and
   2010. Cropland extent peaked at approximately 3.1 Mha in our study area
   in 1990, 38\% of which had been converted from grasslands from 1954 to
   1961. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, 45\% of the Soviet
   croplandwas abandoned and had reverted to grassland by 2000. After 2000,
   cropland contraction and re-cultivation were balanced. Using spatial
   logistic regressions we found that cropland expansion during the Virgin
   Lands Campaign was significantly associated with favorable
   agro-environmental conditions. In contrast, cropland expansion after the
   Campaign until 1990, as well as cropland contraction after 1990,
   occurred mainly in areas that were less favorable for agriculture.
   Cropland re-cultivation after 2000 was occurring on lands with
   relatively favorable agro-environmental conditions in comparison to
   remaining idle croplands, albeit with much lower agro-environmental
   endowment compared to stable croplands from1990 to 2010. In sum, we
   found that cropland production potentials of the currently uncultivated
   areas are much lower than commonly believed, and further cropland
   expansion is only possible at the expense of marginal lands. Our results
   suggest if increasing production is a goal, improving crop yields in
   currently cultivated lands should be a focus, whereas extensive
   livestock grazing as well as the conservation of non-provisioning
   ecosystem services and biodiversity should be priority on more marginal
   lands.}},

Abstract = {{The cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus L.) has been the subject of targeted
   and successful conservation efforts based on agri-environment schemes
   (AES) in the UK since 1993. Recent work has suggested that although
   focused on a single species, there have been wider biodiversity benefits
   for plants and some invertebrates. In this study we investigated whether
   a similar pattern could be found for the Auchenorrhyncha (plant- and
   leafhoppers) within agricultural grasslands, where they form an
   important component of the herbivore community. Sweep netting was used
   to sample Auchenorrhyncha from AES pastures, on which no pesticide or
   fertiliser inputs are allowed, and from conventionally grazed and cut
   (silage) fields at 25 locations in south Devon UK, during 2008.
   Generalised linear mixed models and non-metric multidimensional scaling
   were used to model abundance, species density, and community structure.
   AES fields had the highest abundance, followed by conventionally grazed
   and then cut fields. The same pattern occurred for species density,
   although there was no significant difference between conventionally
   grazed and cut fields. There was no difference in community structure
   between field types. Number of plant species, sward age, and nitrogen
   input were important covariates of field type, suggesting that the
   limitations on inputs resulting from AES are the likely drivers of the
   observed differences. The results add to the evidence base that suggests
   that increased agricultural intensity is inversely related to
   invertebrate biodiversity. They also provide evidence that AES designed
   for the cirl bunting have provided wider biodiversity benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Australia has one of the highest forest clearing rates in the world.
   Over the past 200 years, it has lost about 40\% of total forest cover
   with consequent environmental problems such as soil and wind erosion,
   dryland salinity and biodiversity loss. The Australian Government has
   introduced a scheme to promote mixed species plantings for conservation
   and carbon sequestration benefits. This study first estimates the carbon
   sequestration amounts of these plantings using the Australian
   Government's Reforestation Modelling Tool and rules, and then compares
   the estimated returns with those from competing land uses in the Darling
   Downs region of Queensland, Australia. Costs and benefits data for all
   land uses were collected from different sources and discounted to
   produce net present values. With a standard discount rate, average
   carbon and commodity prices based on recent history and a low
   (\$A1000/ha) direct seeding establishment cost, environmental plantings
   are more profitable than native pasture, grazing oats and forage sorghum
   land uses, but less profitable than grain sorghum and native pasture.
   Higher establishment costs would however favour the continuation of
   conventional agricultural activities, especially given the limited
   impact of revegetation schemes in Australia. A comparison of a policy of
   25 years permanence (as in the Abbott Governments' Direct Action policy)
   with a policy of 100 years permanence, the 25 year permanence policy
   delivers 60\% of the carbon sequestrated that would be sequestered over
   100 years, but when cost components are included and compared with other
   land uses, it gives similar outcomes. Therefore, to be attractive to
   landholders, the restoration of native forests in agricultural areas,
   such as the Darling Downs, will likely require additional incentive
   payments (for environmental services and co-benefits) and reasonable
   contractual certainty. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In European grassland landscapes, grazing and mowing play a key role for
   the maintenance of high-quality habitats that host important bird
   populations. As grasslands are also key resources for cattle feeding,
   there is a need to develop management strategies that achieve the double
   objective of production and biodiversity conservation. The objective of
   this study was to use a modelling approach to generate recognisable
   patterns of bird dynamics in farms composed of different land use
   proportions, and to compare their production and ecological dimensions.
   We developed a dynamic model, which linked grassland management to bird
   population dynamics at the field and farm levels. The model was
   parameterised for two types of suckling farms corresponding to
   contrasting levels of grassland intensification and for two bird species
   of high conservation value. A viability algorithm was used to define and
   assess viable management strategies for production and ecological
   performance so as to draw the shape of the relationship between both
   types of performances for the two types of farms. Our results indicated
   that, at the farm level, there was a farming system effect with a
   negative and non-linear relationship linking performance. Improving bird
   population maintenance was less costly in extensive farms compared with
   intensive farms. At the field level, the model predicted the timing and
   intensity of land use, maximising either production or ecological
   performance. The results suggested that multi-objective grassland
   management would benefit from public policies that consider levels of
   organisation higher than the field level, such as the farm or the
   landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The aim was to test competing hypotheses regarding migration of the
   Andean timberline within the last 2000years.
   Location The upper forest limit in Manu National Park, Peru.
   Methods A randomized stratified design provided 21 soil profiles from
   forested sites just below the timberline, 15 from puna grassland sites
   just above the timberline and 15 from the transitional habitat at the
   puna-forest boundary. From each profile a surface sample (hereafter
   modern) and a sample from the base of the organic horizon (hereafter
   historical) were collected. Pollen and charcoal were analysed from the
   modern and historical layers of the 51 soil profiles. A chronological
   framework was provided by 24 C-14 dates. Data were ordinated as modern
   and historical groups and the temporal trends illustrated by Procrustes
   rotation.
   Results The organic layer from the soil profiles represented the last
   600-2000years. Fire was much more abundant in all habitat types (puna,
   transitional and forested) in the modern compared with the historical
   groups. Samples that had historically been in puna just above the
   timberline showed encroachment by woody species. Samples that had been
   forested were still classified as forest but their composition had
   become more transitional. Sites that were transitional appeared to
   represent a new or expanded class of sites that was far less abundant
   historically.
   Main conclusions Our results are consistent with ongoing warming causing
   an upslope migration of species, although not necessarily of the
   timberline. Weedy fire-tolerant species are spreading upslope, creating
   a transitional forest, softening the boundary between forest and puna.
   Simultaneously, fire introduced to improve grazing outside the park has
   increasingly penetrated the forest and is causing the upper timberline
   to shift towards more fire-tolerant and weedy species. Consequently,
   both the form of the ecotone between forest and grassland and the
   species composition of these forests is changing and is expected to
   continue to change, representing a shifting baseline for what is
   considered to be natural.}},

Journal = {{THEORETICAL POPULATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{31-39}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Body size of vertebrate herbivores is strongly linked to other life
   history traits, most notably (1) tolerance of low quality forage and (2)
   vulnerability to predation, which both impact the composition and
   dynamics of natural communities. However, no study has thus far explored
   how the combination of these two body-size related traits affects the
   long-term composition and dynamics of the herbivore and plant
   communities. We made a simple model of ordinary differential equations
   and simulated a grassland system with three herbivore species (small,
   medium, large) and two predator species (small, large) to investigate
   how the combination of low-quality tolerance and predation-vulnerability
   structure the herbivore and plant community. We found that facilitation
   and competition between different-sized herbivores and predation by
   especially small predators stimulate coexistence among herbivore
   species. Furthermore, the interaction between different-sized herbivores
   and predators generated cyclical succession in the plant community, i.e.
   alternating periods of short vegetation dominated by high-quality
   plants, with periods of tall vegetation dominated by low-quality plants.
   Our results suggest that cyclical succession in plant communities is
   more likely to occur when a predator predominantly preys on small
   herbivore species. Large predators also play an important role, as their
   addition relaxed the set of conditions under which cyclical succession
   occurred. Consequently, our model predictions suggest that a diverse
   predator community plays an important role in the long-term dynamics and
   maintenance of diversity in both the herbivore and plant community. (C)

Abstract = {{Ant communities are generally structured by territoriality, dominance
   and resource monopolization, but in Mediterranean hot grassland thermal
   tolerance plays a more important role. The main purposes of the present
   research were to investigate the hypothesis that in cooler Mediterranean
   forests resource monopolization structures the generalist ground-nesting
   ant community while foraging on trees, and to learn if tree
   heterogeneity plays any role in this structure. In Mediterranean forests
   in Israel, I visually recorded and trapped ants on the forest floor and
   those climbing on trees of five species. Ants of 27 species were
   detected, while the Chao2 index indicated an asymptotic richness
   estimation of 31 +/- 8.1 species (mean +/- S.D.). The numerically
   dominant species were Crematogaster lorteti and Tapinoma sim-rothi
   followed by Tapinoma israele and Crematogaster scutellaris. In more than
   80\% of the cases, specimens of only one ant species climbed at the same
   time on any individual tree, and no tree was occupied by more than three
   species. The C-score of climbing ants was statistically higher than
   simulated indexes when resources were individual trees, indicating that
   the ants strongly monopolized each tree. No difference was detected
   between observed and simulated C-scores when resources were tree
   species. The observed index of Pianka's niche overlap indicated no
   species specific interaction between trees and ants. In conclusion, this
   study confirms that ant mosaic structure may be formed by ground-nesting
   ants while foraging on trees. Tree species heterogeneity did not have a
   selective impact on the ants nor a central role in the ant community

Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{347-366}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Both arthropods and large grazing herbivores are important components
   and drivers of biodiversity in grassland ecosystems, but a synthesis of
   how arthropod diversity is affected by large herbivores has been largely
   missing. To fill this gap, we conducted a literature search, which
   yielded 141 studies on this topic of which 24 simultaneously
   investigated plant and arthropod diversity. Using the data from these 24
   studies, we compared the responses of plant and arthropod diversity to
   an increase in grazing intensity. This quantitative assessment showed no
   overall significant effect of increasing grazing intensity on plant
   diversity, while arthropod diversity was generally negatively affected.
   To understand these negative effects, we explored the mechanisms by
   which large herbivores affect arthropod communities: direct effects,
   changes in vegetation structure, changes in plant community composition,
   changes in soil conditions, and cascading effects within the arthropod
   interaction web. We identify three main factors determining the effects
   of large herbivores on arthropod diversity: (i) unintentional predation
   and increased disturbance, (ii) decreases in total resource abundance
   for arthropods (biomass) and (iii) changes in plant diversity,
   vegetation structure and abiotic conditions. In general, heterogeneity
   in vegetation structure and abiotic conditions increases at intermediate
   grazing intensity, but declines at both low and high grazing intensity.
   We conclude that large herbivores can only increase arthropod diversity
   if they cause an increase in (a)biotic heterogeneity, and then only if
   this increase is large enough to compensate for the loss of total
   resource abundance and the increased mortality rate. This is expected to
   occur only at low herbivore densities or with spatio-temporal variation
   in herbivore densities. As we demonstrate that arthropod diversity is
   often more negatively affected by grazing than plant diversity, we
   strongly recommend considering the specific requirements of arthropods
   when applying grazing management and to include arthropods in monitoring
   schemes. Conservation strategies aiming at maximizing heterogeneity,
   including regulation of herbivore densities (through human interventions
   or top-down control), maintenance of different types of management in
   close proximity and rotational grazing regimes, are the most promising
   options to conserve arthropod diversity.}},

Abstract = {{A synthesis of a long-term (19years) study assessing the effects of
   cattle grazing on the structure and composition of a Mediterranean
   grassland in north-eastern Israel is presented, with new insights into
   the response of the vegetation to grazing management and rainfall. We
   hypothesized that the plant community studied would be resistant to high
   grazing intensities and rainfall variability considering the combined
   long history of land-use and unpredictable climatic conditions where
   this community evolved. Treatments included manipulations of stocking
   densities (moderate, heavy, and very heavy) and of grazing regimes
   (continuous vs. seasonal), in a factorial design. The effect of
   interannual rainfall variation on the expression of grazing impacts on
   the plant community was minor. The main effects of grazing on relative
   cover of plant functional groups were related to early vs. late seasonal
   grazing. Species diversity and equitability were remarkably stable
   across all grazing treatments. A reduction in tall grass cover at higher
   stocking densities was correlated with increased cover of less palatable
   groups such as annual and perennial thistles, as well as shorter and
   prostrate groups such as short annual grasses. This long-term study
   shows that interannual fluctuations in plant functional group
   composition could be partly accounted for by grazing pressure and
   timing, but not by the measured rainfall variables. Grazing affected the
   dominance of tall annual grasses. However, the persistence of tall
   grasses and more palatable species over time, despite large differences
   in grazing pressure and timing, supports the idea that Mediterranean
   grasslands are highly resistant to prolonged grazing. Indeed, even under
   the most extreme grazing conditions applied, there were no signs of
   deterioration or collapse of the ecosystem. This high resistance to
   grazing intensity and interannual fluctuation in climatic conditions
   should favor the persistence of the plant community under forecasted
   increasing unpredictability due to climate change.}},

Title = {{Niche construction by growth forms is as strong a predictor of species

Abstract = {{We present a conceptual framework that describes how species belonging
   to a growth form collectively can be niche constructors (i.e. modify
   niches) and affect species diversity in plant communities. We use an
   empirical assessment of tundra plant communities to illustrate the
   framework's utility. In doing so, we make a first investigation of
   collective niche construction in ecological communities. In tundra plant
   communities, growth forms differently affect ecosystem process rates and
   cause environmental modifications; thus, growth forms are strong
   candidates for being niche constructors. To assess the impact of growth
   form niche construction on plant species diversity, we excluded the
   species of the growth form applied as niche constructor when estimating
   the community species diversity. We assessed niche construction in 70
   tundra meadow communities and 1450 randomly selected tundra plant
   communities that are distributed along ecological gradients in
   temperature, resource availability, competitive interference and
   herbivory. These gradients allowed us to concomitantly assess to what
   extent the niche construction is independent of environmental
   conditions. Growth forms varied from strong positive to neutral
   predictors of both species richness and Simpson index in the order of
   forbs, grasses, sedges, deciduous shrubs and evergreen shrubs,
   suggesting that growth forms have important roles as niche constructors
   in tundra plant communities. Also, the environmental conditions were
   strong predictors of species diversity, but they did not interact with
   or confound the effects of growth forms. Forbs and grasses were the
   least abundant growth forms, yet they were the strongest positive
   predictors of species diversity. Therefore, our results suggest a
   particular niche-constructing role of these growth forms for enhancing
   species diversity in tundra plant communities.Synthesis. In this study,
   we provide conceptual and empirical evidence for collective niche
   construction as a powerful ecological process that affects species
   diversity and that can act independently of environmental conditions.
   Species sharing a single trait or species belonging to a growth form can
   act as collective niche constructors, and as exemplified for growth
   forms in this study, be important predictors of species diversity in
   ecological communities.}},

Abstract = {{By focusing on process-oriented data rather than inventory-type data,
   this study provides a robust understanding of the effects of
   agricultural management on grassland bird reproductive output in the
   moist highland grasslands (MHGs) of South Africa. Four-hundred and four
   nests of 12 grassland-breeding bird species were monitored in five
   different land-use types. Survivorship was modelled using Program MARK
   to assess the effects of these management practices on reproductive
   performance. Six of the species were modelled individually to assess
   speciesspecific responses. Both nest-site selection and nest success
   were driven by vegetation structure, which in turn is driven by habitat
   management. There was an increase in nesting success through the season
   for cup (ground) nesting birds as vegetation structural complexity
   increased through the breeding season (September to March). Nest success
   was driven by predation pressure rather than food availability. Analysis
   of the nesting success of the Yellow-breasted Pipit Anthus chloris
   indicated that unconserved areas house sink populations, confirmation of
   which would depend on a measure of adult survival. The generalist
   African Pipit Anthus cinnamomeus, on the other hand, thrived in
   disturbed, communally grazed lands. To conserve MHG bird species,
   managers should maintain a mosaic of burning regimes, with the majority
   burning biennially or less frequently.}},

Abstract = {{Making accurate predictions of plant community responses to grazing
   management is a major objective of rangeland ecology. Metrics such as
   species composition are site specific, whereas others such as functional
   groups and functional traits can be generalized across different
   rangeland types. We analyzed long-term (1912-1941) shifts in the
   understory community at five sites in a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa
   P. 82 C. Lawson var. scopulorum Engelm.) forest when protected from
   heavy livestock grazing. We examined differences in total basal cover,
   species composition, species richness, functional group composition, and
   community-weighted mean (CWM) functional traits between heavily grazed
   and ungrazed areas in four time periods (1912, 1920, 1930, 1940). Total
   understory basal cover was greater in ungrazed than heavily grazed areas
   in 1920 but not in later time periods. Understory species composition
   diverged by 1930 and continued to differ in 1940. Functional group
   composition differed from 1920 onwards. In 1920 and 1930, C-3 graminoids
   declined more in relative abundance in heavily grazed than ungrazed
   areas. By 1940, forbs accounted for much more of the cover in heavily
   grazed than ungrazed areas. During the study period, CWM specific leaf
   area and foliar N-mass declined by 8\% and 11\%, respectively, in
   ungrazed quadrats, while CWM leaf dry matter content increased 8\%. Leaf
   traits, but not maximum height or seed mass, demonstrated consistent and
   predictable responses to protection from heavy grazing. Herbaceous
   understory species with leaf traits that allow for slower resource
   acquisition became more abundant in response to protection from heavy

   more rapid changes in functional group composition and leaf functional

Abstract = {{Extreme climate events, including floods and droughts, represent
   disturbances that impact plant functioning, biodiversity and ecosystem
   processes. Wetlands can mediate climate change impacts through their
   multiple ecosystem services, and wet grasslands offer a fascinating
   wetland case because they are adapted to regular disturbance regimes
   typified by inundation, cutting and/or grazing. This review identifies
   key concepts for a better understanding of extreme climate impacts on
   wet grassland plant communities, focussing upon the use of functional
   traits for ecological resilience. It suggests that wet grasslands are
   underrepresented in extreme climate event experiments, despite some
   field studies that show floods have significant impacts upon community
   composition. Mechanisms for ecological stability and resilience are
   linked to functional diversity through plant traits, via niche
   complementarity or dominance. Facilitation may be important as climate
   stresses increase, while modified plant behaviour may promote recovery.
   However, plant community responses to extreme events are complex; the
   challenges for wet grassland researchers include: (i) identifying
   thresholds, tipping points and lag effects; (ii) monitoring key
   community components; (iii) using effective plant trait metrics; (iv)
   investigating beyond conservative norms; (v) combining multiple

Abstract = {{Pathogens play an important part in shaping the structure and dynamics
   of natural communities, because species are not affected by them
   equally(1,2). A shared goal of ecology and epidemiology is to predict
   when a species is most vulnerable to disease. A leading hypothesis
   asserts that the impact of disease should increase with host abundance,
   producing a `rare-species advantage'(3-5). However, the impact of a
   pathogen may be decoupled from host abundance, because most pathogens
   infect more than one species, leading to pathogen spillover onto closely
   related species(6,7). Here we show that the phylogenetic and ecological
   structure of the surrounding community can be important predictors of
   disease pressure. We found that the amount of tissue lost to disease
   increased with the relative abundance of a species across a grassland
   plant community, and that this rare-species advantage had an additional
   phylogenetic component: disease pressure was stronger on species with
   many close relatives. We used a global model of pathogen sharing as a
   function of relatedness between hosts, which provided a robust predictor
   of relative disease pressure at the local scale. In our grassland, the
   total amount of disease was most accurately explained not by the
   abundance of the focal host alone, but by the abundance of all species
   in the community weighted by their phylogenetic distance to the host.
   Furthermore, the model strongly predicted observed disease pressure for
   44 novel host species we introduced experimentally to our study site,
   providing evidence for a mechanism to explain why phylogenetically rare
   species are more likely to become invasive when introduced(8,9). Our
   results demonstrate how the phylogenetic and ecological structure of
   communities can have a key role in disease dynamics, with implications
   for the maintenance of biodiversity, biotic resistance against
   introduced weeds, and the success of managed plants in agriculture and
   forestry.}},

   Saline-Alkaline Grassland}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 22}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Management regimes for vegetation restoration of degraded grasslands can
   significantly affect the process of ecological succession. However, few
   studies have focused on variation in the soil seed bank during
   vegetation restoration under different management regimes, especially in
   saline-alkaline grassland habitats. Our aim was to provide insights into
   the ecological effects of grassland management regimes on soil seed bank
   composition and vegetation establishment in mown, fenced, transplanted
   and natural grassland sites, all dominated by the perennial rhizomatous
   grass Leymus chinensis.
   Methodology
   We studied species composition and diversity in both the soil seed bank
   and aboveground vegetation in differently managed grasslands in
   Northeast China. An NMDS (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) was used
   to evaluate the relationship between species composition, soil seed
   banks, aboveground vegetation and soil properties.
   Principal Findings
   Fenced and mown grassland sites had high density and species richness in
   both the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation. The Transplanted
   treatment exhibited the highest vegetation growth and seed production of
   the target species L. chinensis. Seeds of L. chinensis in the soil
   occurred only in transplanted and natural grassland. Based on the NMDS
   analysis, the number of species in both the soil seed bank and
   aboveground vegetation were significantly related to soil Na+, Cl-, RSC
   (residual sodium carbonate), alkalinity, ESP (exchangeable sodium
   percentage) and AP (available phosphorus).
   Conclusions
   Soil seed bank composition and diversity in the saline-alkaline
   grassland were significantly affected by the management regimes
   implemented, and were also significantly related to the aboveground
   vegetation and several soil properties. Based on vegetative growth,
   reproductive output and maintenance of soil seed bank, the transplanting
   was identified as the most effective method for relatively rapid
   restoration of the target species L. chinensis. This approach could be
   beneficial for the restoration of dominant species in a wide range of
   degraded grassland ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, land abandonment constitutes a serious threat for many
   species tied to semi-natural grasslands. In southern Europe, the
   conservation of many grassland bird communities largely depends on
   low-intensity mountain farming. In this study, we analysed the effects
   of the main farming practices promoting grassland maintenance, i.e.
   grazing and mowing, on species richness of a Prealpine grassland bird
   community and on the breeding densities of the two commonest grassland
   species, the skylark (Alauda arvensis Linnaeus, 1758) and the tree pipit
   (Anthus trivialis Linnaeus, 1758). The two study sites were located
   between 1100 and 2000m above sea level in the Italian central Prealps.
   Grassland species richness was positively affected by grazing, and
   increased with increasing distance from the nearest woodland. Skylark
   density was positively influenced by mowing, grassland cover extent and
   distance from woodland, with the latter effect occurring only at a
   single study site. Finally, tree pipit density was positively affected
   by grazing. Our findings suggest that, in order to maintain open
   grasslands below the natural treeline and enhance the biodiversity of
   grassland bird communities, grazing should be preferred over mowing.
   Moreover, woodland edge effects may have a negative impact on mountain
   grassland bird communities. Advancing woodlands and abandonment of
   low-intensity farming and grazing practices may therefore constitute a
   serious threat for open-habitat specialist bird species of the Alpine

Abstract = {{Knowledge of the impact of fire in arid and semi-arid sweet rangeland
   areas and the role it can play in sustainable utilization of the
   rangeland ecosystem is limited. This review uses a South African case
   study (experimental plot data) to elevate the research (soil quality and
   seed bank dynamics) on short-term fire responses in a semi-arid climate.
   The impact of a decrease in basal cover and plant density due to fire,
   especially on the hydrological characteristics of the ecosystem was
   clearly shown. Fire increase soil temperatures and soil compaction, and
   decrease organic matter, which lowers soil-water content and
   infiltration ability. Much of the influence of these variables had not
   been completely reduced two growing seasons after the fire. Reduction of
   organic matter after only one fire is a cause of concern due to
   maintenance of soil fertility. Fire caused a flush of seedlings from the
   soil seed bank over the first season following the fire. Low seedling
   survival with burning can be ascribed to poor basal cover and resultant
   change in microclimate. Fire also negatively influenced species
   richness. The enormous impact of fire on soil characteristics and seed
   bank dynamics, over the short-term, underscores the importance of
   purposeful burning in semi-arid rangelands. It is clear that over the
   short term, fire could strongly influence the sustainability of the

Abstract = {{Semi-natural hay meadows are species rich habitats, formed by a long
   history of management and they have experienced a drastic decline all
   over Europe. There is a vast literature on conservation and species
   diversity of semi-natural hay-meadows, but very limited information on
   historic timing of hay cutting. We analyzed data collected between 1873
   and 1951 on hay cutting dates and phenology of six plant species from
   farms distributed across Sweden. The data set comprised 16,015
   observations from 175 sites. Results show that date of start and end of
   hay cutting varied across Sweden. The start of hay cutting was generally
   delayed by 2.2 days per latitudinal degree and 1.5 days per 100 m
   altitude, while the end of hay cutting was generally delayed by 2.9 days
   per latitudinal degree and 2.5 days per 100 m altitude. The average hay
   cutting period was 18.5 +/- 6.6 days, and became slightly shorter
   northwards. Site-specific factors had a great impact on when hay cutting
   was performed, as indicated by a significant correlation between
   flowering (and leafing) phenology in other species and start date of hay
   cutting. Today, management for conservation is usually related to a
   calendar date (e.g. regulated in eligibility criteria and requirements
   for payment in agri-environment programs in EU). In order to mimic
   historic management that formed this habitat, management should instead
   account for latitude and altitude, between-year variation in timing of
   hay cutting, variation in both start and end dates of hay cutting and if
   possible local phenological conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Phenology is well recognized as one of the most sensitive indicators of
   environmental change. Previous studies have focused on flowering
   phenology with few efforts given to the phenological successes and
   vegetative processes. Additionally, grazing is often characterized as a
   driver for community evolutionary processes, while precipitation is
   known as the most important abiotic cue in arid regions. Given this
   knowledge, we installed a nested experiment in a desert steppe to
   explore the coupled effects of grazing and watering on plant species'
   reproductive successes and phenological timing in 2012-2013. We found
   that grazing increased the proportion of non-flowering individuals, with
   a greater proportion in 2013 than that in 2012. It decreased species
   richness and changed the habitat preferences in both years, and watering
   also reduced the richness in both years. Grazing also delayed the
   phenological timing for some dominant species and significantly delayed
   the green-up timing (5.67 days) and shortened the growing season length
   (GSL) in both 2012 (7.74 days) and 2013 (4.71 days). The application of
   watering, however, delayed some dominant species' timing-including the
   browning timing of five dominate species ranging from 9.57 days in 2013
   to 1.93 days in 2012-but it did not delay the species' green-up timing.
   This resulted in a significantly prolonged growing season in 2013 (8.58
   days). The high soil water and optimal soil temperature in the spring of
   2013 contributed to an earlier green-up time (6.1 days) than in 2012.}},

Abstract = {{Earthworms can have strong direct effects on plant communities through
   consumption and digestion of seeds, however it is unclear how earthworms
   may influence the relative abundance and composition of plant
   communities invaded by non-native species. In this study, earthworms,
   seed banks, and the standing vegetation were sampled in a grassland of
   central California. Our objectives were i) to examine whether the
   abundances of non-native, invasive earthworm species and non-native
   grassland plant species are correlated, and ii) to test whether seed
   ingestion by these worms alters the soil seed bank by evaluating the
   composition of seeds in casts relative to uningested soil. Sampling
   locations were selected based on historical land-use practices,
   including presence or absence of tilling, and revegetation by seed using
   Phalaris aquatica. Only non-native earthworm species were found,
   dominated by the invasive European species Aporrectodea trapezoides.
   Earthworm abundance was significantly higher in the grassland blocks
   dominated by non-native plant species, and these sites had higher carbon
   and moisture contents. Earthworm abundance was also positively related
   to increased emergence of non-native seedlings, but had no effect on
   that of native seedlings. Plant species richness and total seedling
   emergence were higher in casts than in uningested soils. This study
   suggests that there is a potential effect of non-native earthworms in
   promoting non-native and likely invasive plant species within
   grasslands, due to seed-plant-earthworm interactions via soil
   modification or to seed ingestion by earthworms and subsequent cast
   effects on grassland dynamics. This study supports a growing body of
   literature for earthworms as ecosystem engineers but highlights the
   relative importance of considering non-native-native interactions with
   the associated plant community. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Land abandonment and intensification of management have been suggested
   as major drivers of biodiversity change in subalpine and alpine
   grasslands, but the relative importance of these concomitant trends has
   not been extensively studied. Here, we use plant indicator values to
   infer patterns of change in the management intensity of summer pastures.
   Occurrence data of vascular plants from 192 plots surveyed in the Swiss
   Biodiversity Monitoring BDM programme were used to analyse changes in
   five species-based indicator values that express the management
   intensity of sites. Each plot was surveyed twice between 2002 and 2011
   with a time span of 5 years between surveys. We looked for an overall
   trend in management intensity and examined whether a supposed change of
   management intensity depends on site conditions. In addition, we tested
   whether a change in indicator values for management intensity
   accompanies a change in species richness. Over the whole study area,
   there was no overall change in mean indicator values. However, we found
   weak but significant relations between changes in mean indicator values
   and accessibility of the sites. According to plant indicator values,
   intensification of management takes place at well-accessible and
   lower-elevation sites, whereas remote sites and sites at higher
   elevation tend to show a decrease in management intensity. Sites where
   indicators suggested intensified management showed a decrease of both
   total species richness and richness of target species relevant for
   conservation. On the other hand, a supposed decrease in land-use
   intensity led to an increase in species richness within the surveyed
   time period. This study confirms that moderate management intensity of
   summer pastures will best maintain the plant diversity of alpine summer
   pastures. Because the surveyed plots stem from a rigorously standardized
   regular-grid sampling, we attribute high reliability and generality to
   our findings.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: How abundant and diverse are sedges in upland tallgrass
   prairie? Are sedge communities associated with historical land use,
   abundance of an invasive species or different fire and grazing
   management regimes? How do sedge communities compare between
   reconstructed and intact grassland?
   Location: Grand River Grasslands; working tallgrass prairie in
   north-central Missouri and south-central Iowa (US).
   Methods: From 2008 to 2010, we surveyed the sedge species richness and
   measured canopy cover (an estimate of abundance) on 13 tallgrass prairie
   tracts, and measured canopy cover of an invasive C-3 grass, tall fescue
   (Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub). Flowering sedges were identified to
   species and associated with wetland indicator status (WIS) and
   coefficients of conservatism (CoC). We calculated mean WIS, CoC, species
   richness (observed and estimated) and diversity (1/Simpson's D) for each
   tract. We used linear mixed-effect regression and multivariate
   ordination to describe patterns of sedge abundance and community
   composition in terms of land-use history (previously severely grazed
   intact prairie; previously ungrazed intact prairie; and reconstructed
   prairie), tall fescue abundance and current management (patch
   burn-grazed, burned-and-grazed burned only).
   Results: On average, sedges constituted 20 +/- 0.01\% of total plant
   abundance. Sedge abundance increased over time and was higher on intact
   prairie than on reconstructions, but grazing history of intact prairie
   did not affect sedge abundance. We observed 21 species that averaged
   moderate wetland affinity (mean WIS = -2.1 +/- 0.2) and moderate
   affinity for undisturbed habitat (mean CoC = 4.5 +/- 0.2 and 5.0 +/-
   0.1) from Iowa and Missouri lists, respectively). Species richness,
   diversity and conservatism did not vary with land-use history, current
   experimental management or tall fescue abundance, although all three
   variables were associated with patterns of sedge community composition.
   Conclusions: Diverse and abundant sedge communities provide a
   substantial forage resource for early season grazing. Neither historical
   grazing nor current fire/grazing management affected sedge diversity or
   floristic integrity. These data suggest grazing and the degree of
   invasion do not necessarily degrade entire native plant communities -
   responses likely vary among plant groups - but land-use legacies have a
   persistent effect on sedge community composition.}},

Abstract = {{1. The conservation of terrestrial carnivores is hampered by economic
   conflicts between predation and livestock production. The dingo Canis
   dingo is the top predator in Australia's terrestrial ecosystems but its
   abundance is controlled because it preys on livestock. Dingo control
   (poisoning, shooting) is associated with increased densities of wild
   herbivores, which can lead to reduced cattle condition and fertility
   through competition for pasture. We investigated whether the restoration
   of dingoes might provide a net benefit for rangeland vegetation and the
   profit margins of cattle pastoralists.
   2. We developed a dynamic, multi-species metamodel to represent the
   trophic linkages and economics of a rangeland cattle enterprise. To
   estimate the strength of dingo-mediated trophic cascades, we underpinned
   the metamodel with a detailed simulation of pasture growth, grazing
   pressure and cattle live-weight gain. An economic model that calculated
   the costs and revenues associated with maintaining the cattle herd was
   used to examine trade-offs between livestock density, kangaroo
   abundance, calf losses and dingo control.
   3. We simulated the effects of dingo abundance on rangeland ecology
   (pasture biomass, kangaroo density) and enterprise performance (cattle
   live-weight gain, gross margin). Assuming a typical stocking density for
   semi-arid rangelands, we estimated that kangaroo control by an unbaited
   dingo population would increase pasture biomass by 53 kg ha(-1), improve
   gross margins by \$0.83 ha(-1) and reduce inter-annual variability in
   profits.
   4. The increase in pasture biomass due to dingoes was greatest at low
   stocking densities (that permitted high kangaroo abundance in the
   absence of predation), while improvement in profits was strongest at
   intermediate stocking densities (when cattle density was high enough to
   take advantage of the additional pasture biomass). At high stocking
   densities, the abundance of kangaroos was low, so if dingo abundance
   exceeded that required to control kangaroos, some dingo baiting could
   produce small economic gains.
   5. Synthesis and applications. There is little incentive for
   pastoralists to reduce livestock densities in mixed wildlife-livestock
   systems unless wildlife grazing can be controlled. Our results
   demonstrate that top-down herbivore control by dingoes should allow
   cattle pastoralists to profit from conservative stocking densities while
   reducing the risk of pasture over-utilization.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are inherently dynamic in space and time, evolving with
   frequent disturbance from fire and herbivores. As a consequence of human
   actions, many remaining grasslands have become homogenous, which has led
   to reduced ecosystem function, biodiversity loss, and decreased
   ecological services. Previous research has shown that restoring inherent
   heterogeneity to grasslands can increase avian diversity, but the amount
   of heterogeneity (i.e., number of patches or fire return interval) and
   the impact on avian community stability have yet to be investigated. We
   used a unique landscape-level design to examine avian response to
   interacting fire and grazing across multiple experimental landscapes
   that represented a gradient of fire- and grazing-dependent
   heterogeneity. We used seven landscapes (430-980 ha; (x) over bar = 627
   ha) with varying levels of patchiness ranging from annually burned (one
   single patch) with spring-only fires to a four-year fire return interval
   with spring and summer fires (eight patches). This design created a
   range of heterogeneity as a result of pyric herbivory, an ecological
   process in which fire and grazing are allowed to interact in space and
   time. We found that greater heterogeneity across experimental landscapes
   resulted in increased avian diversity and stability over time. An index
   of bird community change, quantified as the sum of the range of
   detrended correspondence analysis axis site scores, was nearly four
   times greater in the most homogenous experimental landscape when
   compared to the most heterogeneous experimental landscape. Species
   responses were consistently positively associated with increased
   heterogeneity at the landscape scale, and within-experimental-landscape
   responses were most often related to litter cover, litter accumulation,
   and vegetation height. We conclude that increased fire-and
   grazing-dependent heterogeneity can result in high variability in the
   bird community at finer, transect scales, but increased diversity and
   stability at broad landscape scales. We recommend that future management
   efforts in rangelands focus on restored disturbance processes to
   increase heterogeneity and improve grassland bird conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The DNA barcoding technique developed for species identification has
   recently been adapted for ecological studies (e.g. host plant
   identification). Comprehensive barcode databases, covering most species
   inhabiting areas, habitats or communities of interest are essential for
   reliable and efficient identification of plants. Here we present a
   three-barcode (plastid rbcL and matK genes and the trnL intron) database
   for xerothermic plant species from central Europe. About 85\% of the
   xerothermic plant species (126 out of c. 150) known to be associated
   with xerothermic habitats were collected and barcoded. The database
   contains barcodes for 117 (rbcL and trnL) and 96 (matK) species.
   Interspecific nucleotide distances were in the ranges 0-17.9\% (0-3.2\%
   within genera) for rbcL, 0-44.4\% (0-3.1\%) for trnL and 0-52.5\%
   (0-10.9\%) for matK. Blast-searching of each sequence in the database
   against the entire database showed that species-level identification is
   possible for 89.6\% (rbcL), 98.4\% (trnL) and 96.4\% (matK) of examined
   plant species. The utility of the presented database for identification
   of host plants was demonstrated using two insect species associated with
   xerothermic habitats: the oligophagous leaf-beetle Cheilotoma
   musciformis (for which two host plants in Fabaceae were identified) and
   the polyphagous weevil Polydrusus inustus (which was found to feed on 14
   host plants, mostly Rosaceae, Asteraceae and Fabaceae). The developed

Abstract = {{Modern, intensive grassland management has led to strong declines in
   ground-nesting grassland birds, and is now increasingly threatening the
   last remaining strongholds of the Whinchat Saxicola rubetra in the
   Central European uplands. In this study, we assess key threats to
   Whinchat populations in these uplands in order to suggest appropriate
   conservation measures. We compared the direct threat of early mowing as
   well as the indirect threat resulting from a deteriorating arthropod
   food source in an inner-alpine valley. Five of our seven study sites
   were mown too early with respect to the chicks' fledging date. Such
   early mowing was particularly evident on the more intensively farmed,
   earlier mown valley bottoms than on the valley slopes. Arthropod
   abundance and biomass did not differ between valley bottoms and slopes.
   However, valley bottoms had a greater amount of unprofitable prey items
   such as flies. Breeding bird density was mainly determined by the degree
   of overlap between the mowing schedule and breeding phenology. These
   findings suggest that in upland grasslands at an early stage of
   intensification, early mowing is of greater importance for populations
   than possible negative effects of a reduced food source. We suggest that
   mowing is delayed until a sufficient proportion of nestlings are safely

Abstract = {{To maintain and enhance phytodiversity of complex permanent swards, the

Abstract = {{Seed size has been advanced as a key factor that influences the dynamics

   predictions of how community dynamics progress based on seed size
   patterns. Information on the abundance of adults, seedlings, soil seed
   banks, seed rains, and the seed mass of 96 species was collected in
   alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (China), which had
   different levels of grazing disturbance. The relationships between

   models. Results showed that grazing levels affected the relationship
   between seed size and abundance properties of adult species, seedlings,
   and the soil seed bank, suggesting that there is a shift in
   seed-size-species-abundance relationships as a response to the grazing
   gradient. Grazing had no effect on the pattern of
   seed-size-seed-rain-abundance at four grazing levels. Grazing also had
   little effect on the pattern of seed-size-species-abundance and pattern

   favorable for increasing the species abundance for smaller-seeded

Abstract = {{Contemporary animal-plant interactions such as herbivory are widely
   understood to be shaped by evolutionary history. Yet questions remain
   about the role of plant phylogenetic diversity in generating and
   maintaining herbivore diversity, and whether evolutionary relatedness of
   producers might predict the composition of consumer communities. We
   tested for evidence of evolutionary associations among arthropods and
   the plants on which they were found, using phylogenetic analysis of
   naturally occurring arthropod assemblages sampled from a plant-diversity
   manipulation experiment. Considering phylogenetic relationships among
   more than 900 arthropod consumer taxa and 29 plant species in the
   experiment, we addressed several interrelated questions. First, our
   results support the hypothesis that arthropod functional traits such as
   body size and trophic role are phylogenetically conserved in community
   ecological samples. Second, herbivores tended to co-occur with closer
   phylogenetic relatives than would be expected at random, whereas
   predators and parasitoids did not show phylogenetic association
   patterns. Consumer specialization, as measured by association through
   time with monocultures of particular host plant species, showed
   significant phylogenetic signal, although the strength of this
   association varied among plant species. Polycultures of phylogenetically
   dissimilar plant species supported more phylogenetically dissimilar
   consumer communities than did phylogenetically similar polycultures.
   Finally, we separated the effects of plant species richness and
   relatedness in predicting the phylogenetic distribution of the arthropod
   assemblages in this experiment. The phylogenetic diversity of plant
   communities predicted the phylogenetic diversity of herbivore
   communities even after accounting for plant species richness. The
   phylogenetic diversity of secondary consumers differed by guild, with
   predator phylogenetic diversity responding to herbivore relatedness,
   while parasitoid phylogenetic diversity was driven by plant relatedness.
   Evolutionary associations between plants and their consumers are
   apparent in plots only meters apart in a single field, indicating a
   strong role for host-plant phylogenetic diversity in sustaining
   landscape consumer biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Revisiting the classical Gradmann's steppe theory' for central Europe,
   we examine whether the early Holocene steppe habitats survived the
   critical period of maximum Holocene afforestation: the mid-Holocene
   bottleneck. Despite the undisputable fact that afforestation was a
   dominant ecological factor in this period, our parallel analyses of
   pollen and molluscs from sedimentary sequences discovered in the dry
   lowland area of northern Bohemia, Czech Republic (Zahaji and Suchy potok
   sites, lower Ohe area) provide strong evidence for uninterrupted local
   occurrence of steppe grasslands throughout the Holocene. At the onset of
   the Neolithic agriculture, this area was covered by forest-steppe.
   Analogously to the present forest-steppe landscapes of eastern Europe
   and south-western Siberia, dry areas of northern Bohemia were dominated
   by open-canopy pine-birch forests that enabled continuous survival of
   many light-demanding plant species from the late Glacial and early
   Holocene to the Neolithic. Later on, anthropogenic deforestation and
   livestock grazing created a semi-natural steppe. Our data suggest that
   this secondary steppe can be viewed as a direct continuation of the late
   Pleistocene and early Holocene natural steppe rather than a purely
   cultural steppe developed only after deforestation of a continuously
   forested mid-Holocene landscape by humans. At the same time, we provide
   evidence supporting Gradmann's steppe theory', assuming that in central
   Europe, Neolithic farming started in those areas that were not
   completely forested but contained remnants of natural steppes. This
   finding has important implications for the interpretation of present
   biodiversity patterns in central Europe.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The River Shannon, Ireland, among the last unregulated rivers in western
   Europe, has extensive floodplains and supports rare and endangered
   species and habitats, of ecological and cultural importance. Unregulated
   floodplains result in community composition responding directly to
   natural fluctuations in water level. This study assesses how
   hydrological factors and farming practices effect flood meadow plant
   communities. Three main plant communities were identified, forming an
   uninterrupted ecotone, along a gradient of dry to wet. Habitats of
   European conservation interest (Lowland Hay Meadows and Molinia Meadows)
   were well represented. Hydroperiod, calculated using microtopographical
   measurements, was the primary factor determining community composition
   and was negatively correlated with elevation and plant species richness.
   The botanical continuum comprised a range of insect-pollinated species,
   demonstrating the role of floodplains in providing pollinator services.
   Climate change projections indicate more prolonged winter flooding in
   the future, signifying potential range shifts for these plant species
   and communities; highlighting the need for appropriate conservation
   measures in the surrounding landscape. Low-intensity farming practices,
   with minimal fertiliser use and regular hay-mowing, played an essential,
   secondary role in maintaining plant species diversity. Retaining the
   floodplain topography, its associated hydrological regime and
   low-intensity farming practices, are necessary to maintain species
   diversity and ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Community assembly theory predicts that resource availability, biotic

   composition. Recent work has demonstrated that manipulating these

   restoring invaded plant communities. In this study, we began by
   manipulating an abiotic filter, summer water availability, on the theory
   that irrigation prior to the growing season could trigger the
   germination of exotic species during unfavorable environmental
   conditions. First, we performed a greenhouse experiment to assess the
   germination traits of 23 native and exotic species at low (16 degrees C,
   spring) and high (30 degrees C, summer) temperatures. At summer
   temperatures, we found high emergence of many exotic and native grasses
   and low emergence of native forbs suggesting that summer irrigation may
   help deplete the exotic seed bank. In a second experiment, we
   established field plots to test the efficacy of summer irrigation and
   simultaneously manipulated a biotic and a dispersal filter, subjecting
   some plots to grazing and/or native seed addition. Summer irrigation and
   seed addition had no effect on percent cover or species richness while
   grazing reduced native cover but increased native species richness and
   soil nitrogen content. Our data suggest that manipulating grazing (a
   biotic filter) may be more effective than altering abiotic or dispersal
   filters when restoring invaded serpentine grassland. However, summer
   irrigation may also be effective, if applied at lower temperatures or

Abstract = {{The plant-trait-based method is powerful for assessing ecosystem
   services provided by species-rich grasslands, but its use presents
   difficulties for stakeholders involved in field studies. Therefore, we
   examined whether a simplified plant-functional-type method could
   overcome such difficulties. A total of 1287 grasslands, spread over
   eight regions, were characterized according to their environmental and
   management factors, eight indicator (including Ellenberg) values and
   abundance of five previously defined grass functional types (GFTs)
   differing in growth strategies (fast-slow, early-late). Four related
   plant-community-composition descriptors indicating forage services
   (forage production, digestibility, distribution of herbage biomass
   throughout the growing season and management flexibility) responded to
   environmental and management factors that are correlated to indicator
   values. Based on GFTs, cluster analysis defined vegetation types (VTs).
   Their relationships to environmental and management factors (or proxies
   of them), forage services and species richness were subsequently
   analysed. Of the thirteen VTs, four consisted mainly of GFTs with a
   dominant fast-growth strategy and three with a slow-growth strategy.
   These clusters were clearly related to two stress axes (temperature and
   nutrients). The other six VTs consisted of a mixture of both strategies
   and corresponded to intermediate levels of stress and disturbance.
   Although simplified, the method distinguished VTs that responded
   consistently to environmental and management factors and provides
   accurate indicators of forage services.}},

Abstract = {{Calcareous fens are habitats that are well-adapted to extreme ecological
   conditions (water with a very high calcium content). The vegetation
   response following the application of restoration measures (mowing,
   removal of shrubs) in a calcareous fen (site Sliacske travertiny,
   western Carpathians) was observed over six years in six permanent plots.
   Three plots were established in an area strongly invaded by reeds
   (Phragmites australis), where restoration mowing was introduced, and
   three plots were established in an area overgrown by willows, where the
   shrubs were partly removed at the beginning and no other management
   measures were subsequently applied. Indirect and direct gradient
   analyses (Principal Component Analysis and Redundancy Analysis) and
   General Linear Models showed that species composition in the mown reed
   area evolved towards the typical composition of calcareous fens,
   although reeds were still dominant in the canopy. The overall species
   richness, as well as number of fen indicator species increased here,
   especially on the most-detailed scale of 0.25 x 0.25 m. In contrast, the
   species composition in the unmown area with willows developed towards a
   higher abundance of wetland generalists. The species richness of
   vascular plants increased on the scale of 2 x 2 m, but the number of
   bryophyte species decreased on the scale of 0.25 x 0.25 m and the number
   of fen indicators species remained unchanged. Our survey showed that
   mowing can be used for the restoration of calcareous fens invaded by
   reed, but the total supression of reed can not be achieved in short time
   period. Furthermore, the occasional removal of shrubs on overgrown
   calcareous fens is not a feasible method of habitat management.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory is an important modulator of plant biodiversity and

   long-term (17 years) experimental site, we evaluated impacts of rabbit

   cycling, microbial diversity, structure and functional composition. Both
   rabbit and invertebrate grazing impacted soil functions and microbial
   community structure. All functional community measures (functions,
   biogeochemical cycling genes, network association between different
   taxa) were more strongly affected by invertebrate grazers than rabbits.
   Furthermore, our results suggest that exclusion of invertebrate grazers
   decreases both microbial biomass and abundance of genes associated with
   key biogeochemical cycles, and could thus have long-term consequences
   for ecosystem functions. The mechanism behind these impacts are likely
   to be driven by both direct effects of grazing altering the pattern of
   nutrient inputs and by indirect effects through changes in plant species
   composition. However, we could not entirely discount that the pesticide
   used to exclude invertebrates may have affected some microbial community

Abstract = {{Soil moisture is one of the most important environmental factors that
   affects species composition patterns in herbaceous plant communities.
   Changes in bryophyte cover along moisture gradient were recorded at two
   spatial scales in the vegetation of mown meadows and mesic pastures
   (Molinio-Arrhenatheretea class). The Slovak national dataset (SK) of
   1183 vegetation plots and a local subset of 160 plots on the Muranska
   planina Mts (MP) were analyzed. The main compositional gradient was
   determined by detrended correspondence analysis and was interpreted
   using Ellenberg indicator values for vascular plants. Variations in
   species composition in both datasets were similarly driven by moisture.
   The most common bryophytes at the national and local scales were the
   pleurocarpous mosses Brachythecium rutabulum (Hedw.) Schimp.,
   Calliergonella cuspidata (Hedw.) Loeske, Climacium dendroides (Hedw.) F.

   P.affine agg. (4.6\% SK; 23.2\% MP). The shape of the bryophyte
   cover-moisture relationship was analyzed for all five mosses using only

   groups (legumes, grasses, non-leguminous small and tall herbs) on N
   yield or soil N-min concentrations or (iii) the relationships between
   plant diversity and N yield or soil Nmin concentrations. We observed
   highest productivity under moderate management intensity which can be
   attributed to the growth-stimulating fertilizer effect associated with
   enough time for regrowth. With increasing management intensity, the
   positive effect of the presence of legumes on N yield and soil N-min
   concentrations disappeared. Plant species richness was positively
   related to N yield with the most pronounced effect in the highly
   fertilized and frequently mown treatment. In the control (mown twice a
   year, non-fertilized), competition for nutrients very likely underlie
   plant species richness effects. Under higher management intensity, a
   combination of competition for light and adaption to mowing frequency
   seemed to be responsible for plant species richness effects. The
   concurrence of highest N yield in high-diversity mixtures under most
   intensive management indicates that some plant species must have more
   than compensated for the N uptake of non-adapted species that did not
   survive frequent mowing, highlighting the value of plant diversity as an
   insurance against anthropogenic disturbances including management
   measures.}},

Abstract = {{Large areas of tropical moist forests have been converted to cattle
   pastures, generating complex landscapes where different habitats are
   represented by small patches with an uneven spatial distribution. Here,
   we describe how bird communities respond to the different elements
   present in a livestock landscape that was originally dominated by
   tropical moist forest. We surveyed six habitats: open pastures, pastures
   with shrubs, early- and middle-secondary forests, mature forest, and
   pastures invaded by bracken ferns (Pteridium aquilinum). Bird diversity
   was high in secondary and mature forests, and low in fern-invaded sites
   and open pastures. Fern-dominated sites had the lowest bird species
   richness, and trophic guild diversity of all habitats. Habitat structure
   affected both bird species richness and densities in similar ways. Tree
   species richness was the habitat attribute that had a bigger positive
   effect on bird species richness. Bird community structure varied among
   sampled habitats, separating habitats in two major groups (forests and
   pastures). Our data indicate that bracken fern-invaded pastures were the
   worst habitat condition for avian communities. To increase bird
   diversity, we recommend to eliminate or manage bracken fern and to
   increase shrub and tree cover in open pastures to provide food resources
   and shelter for birds. Finally, we encourage the maintenance of
   secondary and mature forest remnants as a strategy to conserve resident
   birds within a landscape dominated by livestock activities.}},

Abstract = {{The resilience, diversity and stability of mountain ecosystems are
   threatened by climatic as well as land-use changes, but the combined
   effects of these drivers are only poorly understood. We combine two
   high-resolution sediment records from Iffigsee (2065m a.s.l.) and
   Lauenensee (1382m a.s.l.) at different elevations in the Northern Swiss
   Alps to provide a detailed history of vegetational changes during the
   period of first pastoralism (ca. 7000-5000cal. BP, 5000-3000 BC) in
   order to understand ongoing and future changes in mountain ecosystems.
   We use palaeoecological methods (fossil pollen, spore, microscopic
   charcoal and macrofossil analysis) as well as ecological ordination
   techniques and time-series analysis to quantify the impact of fire and
   grazing on natural mountain vegetation at Iffigsee. Fire was used by
   Neolithic people to create pastures at timberline and clear forests for
   arable farming in the valley. This had a significant, long-term effect
   on the mountain vegetation and a negative impact on keystone forest
   species such as Abies alba, Larix decidua and Pinus cembra. The mass
   expansion of Picea abies at ca. 5500cal. BP (ca. 3500 BC) was
   facilitated by anthropogenic disturbance (fire, grazing and logging)
   causing an irreversible decline in Abies alba. Temperate Abies alba
   forests, which existed under warmer-than-today conditions, might be
   better adapted to projected climate change than today's
   drought-sensitive Picea abies forests, especially under low
   anthropogenic disturbance following land abandonment.Synthesis. Human
   impact for millennia has shaped mountain vegetation in the Alps and
   still continues to have a large effect on today's species composition
   and distribution. Fire and traditional pastoralism have the potential to
   mitigate the effects of climate change, maintain species-rich
   high-alpine meadows and prevent biodiversity losses.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory can affect plant community composition and diversity by
   removing biomass and reducing light competition. Herbivory may
   particularly benefit low growing species such as bryophytes, which are
   frequently limited by light competition. Gastropods are important
   herbivores of seed plants and cryptogams, furthermore, they can disperse
   propagules such as seeds and spores via endozoochory. However, whether
   gastropod herbivory can reduce the dominance of vascular plants and
   thereby promote the germination and establishment of endozoochorously
   dispersed bryophyte spores has never been tested experimentally.
   Moreover, it is unclear whether these possible interacting effects can
   influence bryophyte species richness. Here, we tested for endozoochorous
   spore dispersal by slugs, in combination with sowing of vascular plants,
   in a fully factorial common garden experiment. Enclosures contained
   either slugs previously fed with bryophyte sporophytes, control slugs,
   or no slugs. After 21 days the bryophyte cover was on average 2.8 times
   higher (3.9\% versus 1.4\%) and after eight months the bryophyte species
   richness 2.6 times higher (5.8 versus 2.2) in enclosures containing
   slugs previously fed with bryophyte sporophytes than in the other
   treatments. Furthermore, after eight months high vascular plant cover
   reduced bryophyte diversity. On average enclosures without seed sowing
   harboured 1.6 times more bryophyte species than the ones with seed
   sowing (4.2 versus 2.6), indicating competitive effects of vascular
   plants on bryophytes. Our findings suggest that slugs are important
   dispersal vectors for bryophytes and that they can increase bryophyte
   populations and maintain bryophyte diversity by reducing the dominance

Abstract = {{The intensification of agriculture has led to a dramatic decrease in
   traditional forest pastures in Northern Europe. Furthermore, the
   remaining forest pastures have often lost their typical characteristics
   due to eutrophication and forestry practices. We investigated whether
   the common management practice of fencing forest pastures within the
   same enclosures as fertilized grassland pastures leads to eutrophication
   and the consequent decline of bryophyte and vascular plant diversity in
   Finnish forest pastures, given that when cattle can freely roam between
   the fertilized grassland pastures and unfertilized forest pastures,
   nutrients are transported to the forest pastures in the feces and urine
   of the grazing animals. We found that grazing led to higher electrical
   conductivity and potassium (K) levels in the forest pastures (n = 18)
   compared to the background levels in adjacent non-grazed forests (n
   =18). Vascular plant species richness and diversity (Shannon's entropy)
   were higher and community structures different in the forest pastures
   compared to the adjacent forests. Highest species richness was observed
   in the forest pastures that were unconnected to fertilized grasslands (n
   = 7). Connection here refers to the situation where cattle can access
   both forest pasture and adjacent fertilized grassland simultaneously.
   Furthermore, many species indicative of valuable semi-natural pasture
   biotopes were found only in these traditionally managed forest pastures.
   In contrast, bryophyte species richness did not differ between the
   forests and the two types of forest pastures. Moreover, bryophyte
   communities largely overlapped between the forests and the forest
   pastures. Our results indicate that even if the forest pastures
   connected to the fertilized grasslands sustain plant communities that
   are characteristic of unfertilized semi-natural forest pastures, the
   conservational quality and diversity of vascular plant communities in
   particular may be reduced in comparison to the forest pastures without
   grassland connection. This decline can, at least partially, be caused by
   the transport of nutrients to the forest pastures and, hence, we
   recommend that forest pastures are not connected with fertilized
   grasslands. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the influences of different utilization patterns in
   different grassland types on grassland traits is essential for grassland
   conservation and improvement of grassland management. Grazing, mowing,
   and fencing have the potential to substantially affect vegetation
   characteristics. The general pattern and mechanisms for relationships
   between vegetation characteristics and abiotic factors are fundamental
   issues in ecology .The effect of the key factors on vegetation traits
   under different management practices has been rarely comprehensively
   elucidated in previous studies,especially across the temperate
   grasslands in the Hulunbuir region. Therefore, the principal purposes of
   this study were: (1) to analyze the effects of different management
   practices on vegetation characteristics using data investigated from 23
   sites across the temperate grasslands; (2) to explore the relationship
   of environmental factors with vegetation dynamics, and to identify the
   main factors using correlation analysis; and (3) to predict the
   evolution of vegetation dynamics with the major factors using the
   generalized additive modelat the landscape scale.
   The study area is situated at the western part of Mt. Daxing'anling,
   Hulunbuir, Inner Mongolia, China. Samples were collected in the
   grasslands utilized for grazing (always from 10 sampled sites), mowing
   (since 2003, from 6 sampled sites), and fencing (since 2003, from 7
   samples sites). In each site, we investigated above ground biomass,
   below ground, litter, coverage and soil properties in five plots (1 m x
   1 m) at a 10 m interval along a transect. Data pertaining to the
   environmental factors and vegetation characteristics in different
   utilization types were compared using ANOVA. The relationship of the
   main elements with vegetation traits was analyzed using CA in these
   utilization types. GAM analysis was conducted to explore the
   evolutionary trend of vegetation dynamics with respect to the critical
   factors at the landscape scale.
   Fencing and mowing practices, which can improve vegetation traits, and
   increase grassland carbon sink, should be continued to promote the
   Hulunbuir grasslands, rather than grazing management. Thus, appropriate
   reforms concerning the proper utilize the grassland (e.g. mowing and
   fencing) is necessary to ensure sustainability of the grassland
   ecological system, and what is more, the effects of the ecological
   project in the sustainable development of the temperate grasslands in
   the Hulunbuir region should be gradually explored.}},

   LocationSchwabische Alb, Hainich and Schorfheide, Germany.
   MethodsWe planted different species from the regional grassland species
   pool into extant grassland communities exposed to different levels of
   land-use intensity. Species composition was recorded across 54 sites
   comprising meadows, mown meadows and grazed grasslands located within
   the Biodiversity Exploratories' project areas in three different regions
   of Germany. New species were selected for enrichment planting in the
   plots according to four different scenarios: species with highly similar
   or dissimilar traits, species with the highest degree of co-occurrence
   (derived from vegetation records held in the German vegetation reference
   database) and randomly chosen species. The changes in community mean
   trait distances brought about by enrichment planting and the transplant
   survival were related to land-use intensity.
   Results and ConclusionLand use was found to be an important
   environmental filter, as mean trait distance consistently declined with
   increasing land-use intensity across all scenarios. The planted species
   with the highest probability of co-occurrence with the resident species
   did not change the mean pair-wise trait distances across all plots,
   which indicates that they reflected the same degree of environmental
   filtering as the resident species. Accordingly, the species that
   commonly co-occur with the resident species survived best. These

Abstract = {{Nitrogen is essential to improving agricultural production systems,

   years on estimated leaching levels using a simple computation procedure
   and measurements of soil water content and water balance, nitrate
   concentrations in drainage water and meteorological data, and to assess
   the impacts of the duration of the grassland phase and the level of
   nitrogen fertilization on grassland on the drainage water quality. The
   study was carried out at a site of the Long-term Environmental Research
   Observation and Experimentation facility (SOERE) for Environmental
   Research-Agro-ecosystems, Biogeochemical Cycles and Biodiversity, run by
   the INRA experimental unit of Lusignan. The experimental treatments were
   sequences of maize, wheat and barley with different grassland rotational
   periods (a pure arable crop rotation; three or six years of grassland
   receiving high-level nitrogen applications; six years of grassland with
   a low N application rate and long-term grassland with nitrogen
   application). The study covered the period from April 2005 to June 2013,
   during which most drainage occurred in the autumn and early winter.
   Treatments with the longest duration of grassland exhibited less
   drainage than those containing a higher proportion of arable crops. The
   average nitrate concentration was 52.7 +/- 38.63 mg NO3 L-1 under a pure
   crop rotation, compared to 14.9 +/- 14.76 mgNO(3) L-1 under a petmanent

   cumulative nitrogen leaching between the different cropping systems,
   ranging from 9 to 37 kgN ha(-1) year(-1). The introduction of mowed
   grassland sequences into this arable crop rotation caused a marked
   reduction in the nitrate levels in groundwater, and the greater the

Abstract = {{We propose the Stream Biome Gradient Concept as a way to predict
   macroscale biological patterns in streams. This concept is based on the
   hypothesis that many abiotic and biotic features of streams change
   predictably along climate (temperature and precipitation) gradients
   because of direct influences of climate on hydrology, geomorphology, and
   interactions mediated by terrestrial vegetation. The Stream Biome
   Gradient Concept generates testable hypotheses related to continental
   variation among streams worldwide and allows aquatic scientists to
   understand how results from one biome might apply to a less-studied
   biome. Some predicted factors change monotonically across the
   biome/climate gradients, whereas others have maxima or minima in the
   central portion of the gradient. For example, predictions across the
   gradient from drier deserts through grasslands to wetter forests include
   more permanent flow, less bare ground, lower erosion and sediment
   transport rates, decreased importance of autochthonous C inputs to food
   webs, and greater stream animal species richness. In contrast, effects
   of large ungulate grazers on streams are expected to be greater in
   grasslands than in forests or deserts, and fire is expected to have
   weaker effects in grassland streams than in desert and forest streams
   along biome gradients with changing precipitation and constant latitude
   or elevation. Understanding historic patterns among biomes can help
   describe the evolutionary template at relevant biogeographic scales, can
   be used to broaden other conceptual models of stream ecology, and could
   lead to better management and conservation across the broadest scales.}},

   insect community composition were studied in a three-year field
   experiment. The study included 15 field-forest ecotones, each with a 50m
   long and 25 m wide treated area and a corresponding control. At forest
   edge, a 5m wide strip was clear-cut and behind this strip, a 20m wide

   promoted all three aspects of insect diversity. Changes were more

   composition changed via increased abundance of open habitat species,

   availability at clear-cut edges. All three aspects of insect diversity
   showed a positive response to flower coverage, which in turn was
   negatively correlated with the amount of logging residue. Creating open
   field-forest ecotones is beneficial for flower-visiting insects and open

   attributes in a full factorial design, using three grassland plant
   species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Plantago lanceolata, and Lotus
   corniculatus). The impact of the three community attributes on the soil
   microbial community structure and functioning was evaluated after two
   growing seasons by ester-linked phospholipid fatty-acids analysis,
   substrate-induced respiration, basal respiration, and nitrogen
   mineralization and nitrification rates. Our results suggested that the
   dominant species identity had the most prevalent influence of the three
   community attributes, with significant effects on most of the measured
   aspects of microbial biomass, composition and functioning. Evenness had
   no effects on microbial community structure, but independently
   influenced basal respiration. Its effects on nitrogen cycling depended
   on the identity of the dominant plant species, indicating that
   interactions among species and their effects on functioning can vary
   with their relative abundance. Systems with an aggregated spatial
   arrangement had a different microbial community composition and a higher
   microbial biomass compared to those with a random spatial arrangement,
   but rarely differed in their functioning. Overall, it appears that
   dominant species identity was the main driver of soil microorganisms and
   functioning in these model grassland communities, but that other plant
   community attributes such as evenness and spatial arrangement can also
   be important.}},

Abstract = {{Several billion euros are spent in Europe every year on agri-environment
   schemes to compensate farmers for (costly) conservation measures such as
   specific mowing and grazing regimes. These measures can impact grassland
   species during their reproductive period. Therefore, it is particularly
   important when (and not only where) they are applied. However, in
   contrast to the spatial allocation of measures, their temporal
   allocation has rarely been taken into consideration. Existing modeling
   approaches suffer from two major limitations: They consume too much
   computing time for optimization procedures at the landscape scale, and
   they are too specific to be applicable to a wide variety of species and
   measures. We overcome these limitations by developing a spatially and
   temporally explicit general modeling approach that can quantify a
   species-specific habitat quality as a function of timing and location of
   grassland measures in a straightforward and general way. We apply our
   approach to the example of grassland conservation in the German Federal
   State of Saxony, demonstrate its usefulness, and identify the effects of
   the timing and location of grassland measures. We find that considerable
   heterogeneity in the timing of measures is necessary for multi-species
   conservation. This type of quantitative analysis can assist decision
   makers in improving agri-environment schemes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Native vegetation fragments embedded in anthropogenic landscapes are
   increasingly threatened by land-use intensification. Managing
   disturbance regimes and nutrient inputs may help maintain species
   diversity in such remnants. Yet, it is unclear the extent to which
   changes in resource availability due to reduced capture by resident
   plants and/or increased supply rates may trigger native community
   disassembly and exotic invasions. We examined how mowing disturbance and
   N fertilizer addition affected plant community recovery after a burning
   event in a remnant corridor of tussock pampa grassland in Argentina. The
   percentage cover and richness of native and exotic plant functional
   groups were monitored over 4years. According to the fluctuating resource
   theory', we expected invasion to be the highest when both light and N
   availability were increased simultaneously. Mowing delayed recovery by
   dominant C-4 tussock grasses and promoted subordinate, native C-3
   grasses and exotic legumes, thus enhancing both native and exotic
   species richness. Fertilization induced a transient increase in native
   forbs but decreased total plant richness. Moreover, N addition to mowed
   grassland led to rapid invasion by short-lived exotic forbs, which were
   then replaced by exotic perennial grasses. Exotic grasses eventually
   spread across the grassland corridor, although at different rates
   depending on the treatment, and in parallel to a generalized decline in
   native species cover.Synthesis and applications. Community disassembly
   patterns reflected differential responses of native and exotic
   functional groups to altered resource supply rates. Synergisms between
   canopy disturbances and N enrichment posed the greatest threat to
   preserving a pampa grassland remnant prone to invasion. Establishing

Abstract = {{Disturbances, such as fire and grazing, are often claimed to facilitate
   plant species richness and plant invasions in particular, although
   empirical evidence is contradictory. We conducted a meta-analysis to
   synthesize the literature on how non-native plant species are affected
   by disturbances. We explored whether the observed impact of disturbance
   on non-native plant communities is related to its type and frequency, to
   habitat type, study approach (observational or experimental), and to the
   temporal and spatial scales of the study. To put the results in a
   broader context, we also conducted a set of parallel analyses on a data
   set involving native plant species. The diversity and abundance of
   non-native plant species were significantly higher at disturbed sites
   than at undisturbed sites, while the diversity and abundance of native
   plant species did not differ between the two types of sites. The effect
   of disturbance on non-native plant species depended on the measure used
   to evaluate the impact (species diversity or abundance) and on
   disturbance type, with grazing and anthropogenic disturbances leading to
   higher diversity and abundance of non-native plant species than other
   disturbance types examined. The impact of disturbance on non-natives was
   also associated with study approach, habitat type and temporal scale,
   but these factors covaried with disturbance type, complicating the
   interpretation of the results. Overall, our results indicate that
   disturbance has a positive impact particularly on non-native plant
   species (at least when they are already present in the community), and
   that the strength of this impact depends primarily on the disturbance
   type.
   Synthesis Empirical evidence of the effect of disturbances on plant
   species richness is contradictory. Here we use a meta-analysis to
   synthesize the published literature on how different types of
   disturbances influence the diversity and abundance of plant species,
   focusing in particular on non-native plants. Our study supports the
   hypothesis that disturbances generally facilitate the diversity and
   abundance of non-native plant species, although the strength of this
   facilitation depends primarily on the disturbance type.}},

Abstract = {{For some decades, grazing by cattle and horses is used as a management
   tool to achieve different nature management goals. For managers there
   are still questions to be answered about the effects of herbivore
   densities on their performance, vegetation development and biodiversity.
   This study examines the effect of density on diet composition, diet
   quality and body condition of cattle and horses. We expressed density as
   the ratio between consumption and net primary production of the
   preferred grasslands. Over a period of one year, we studied sward height
   and diet composition, diet quality and body condition of free ranging
   cattle and horses in two different study areas with different ratios
   between consumption and production. Our results showed that the amount
   of preferred high quality grasses in the diet of cattle and horses was
   lower when herbivore density was higher. As a result diet quality was
   lower and as a result of that body condition was affected. In October
   body condition of cows was lower and in March body of cows and mares was
   lower in the high density area. A striking difference between cattle and
   horses was that during the growing season and at high densities, the
   amount of preferred grasses in the diet of cattle decreased whereas that
   of horses increased. This was most likely caused by sward height which
   became probably too low for cattle. As cattle prefer grass heights of
   9-16 cm, grass heights lower than those make it difficult for cattle to
   achieve a sufficient instantaneous intake rate. This means that in
   homogeneous areas and at high herbivore densities, horses can outcompete
   cattle. In this paper the effects of density dependent diet selection on
   vegetation development and conservation management are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is an important management tool in east Africa as a way
   to improve foraging conditions for herbivores, and to make wildlife
   easier for tourists to observe and photograph. Although past research
   has investigated the factors influencing herbivore use of post-fire
   vegetation, the temporal dynamics of these effects have seldom been
   documented, and use of burned areas by African carnivores has not been
   evaluated. Between 2008 and 2011, we studied responses of 8 common
   herbivores and 8 carnivore species to burns in the Mara-Serengeti
   ecosystem in southwestern Kenya by monitoring mammal abundance on 4
   transects from up to 136 days before burning, and up to 748 days after
   burning. Among herbivores, zebra, warthog, Thomson's gazelle, Grant's
   gazelle, and topi, occurred in higher densities in burned than unburned
   areas. Impala and wildebeest showed trends toward occurring in higher
   densities in burned areas. These effects lasted up to 120 days for
   Thomson's gazelle, but we did not observe a specific temporal
   relationship to burning in the other 5 herbivore species. Both small and
   large carnivores were more likely to be observed along transects after
   than before burns; we observed small carnivores including black-backed
   jackals, side-striped jackals, bat-eared foxes, and banded mongoose in
   greater numbers up to 365 days after burns but observed large
   carnivores, including African lions, spotted hyenas, leopards, and
   cheetahs, in greater numbers only for up to 120 days after burns. Our
   results indicate that wildlife responses to prescribed fire last 1 year
   in this region. Although burning stimulates vegetation growth and
   improves wildlife visibility, managers should recognize that wildlife
   responses might not persist for more than a few months in tropical
   African savannas like the one monitored here. (c) 2014 The Wildlife

Volume = {{75}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A rapid increase in grazing intensity since the 1980s has caused large
   areas of the Inner Mongolian grasslands to become degraded. Increasing
   atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition might exert an important influence
   on vegetation restoration in these degraded grasslands by increasing
   available N and relieving N limitations on productivity. However, no
   previous studies have tested the assumption that increasing N deposition
   promotes vegetation restoration in degraded grasslands. By conducting a
   4-year field restoration experiment with four N addition treatments (0,
   5, 10, and 20 g Nm (2) year (1)) and two grazing treatments (grazed and
   ungrazed), we investigated the effects of N enrichment and grazing on
   the restoration of patches in which vegetation had been degraded. N
   addition significantly accelerated the restoration of
   vegetation-degraded grassland patches regarding both plant cover and
   diversity. Moderate grazing also promoted the restoration of
   degraded-vegetation patches in term of both plant diversity and species
   similarity. Importantly, the positive effects of N addition on the
   restoration of degraded patches may be augmented by grazing. This study
   demonstrate that low levels of N enrichment (or increasing atmospheric N
   deposition) positively impact vegetation restoration in degraded
   grassland patches, particularly under moderate grazing practices. Our
   findings provide new insights into the management of severely degraded
   grasslands through the regulation of N inputs and grazing practices. (C)

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Rich fens are known for their high botanical diversity encompassing many
   endangered species. For decades, several management measures, including
   mowing and burning, have been applied to maintain a high biodiversity by
   means of slowing down the natural succession from calcareous rich fens
   to acidic poor fens or woodland. In this study, we assessed the
   long-term effects of these traditional management measures, and explored
   the effectiveness of liming as a measure to restore rich fen vegetation.
   Effects of summer mowing, and of burning after winter mowing, were
   assessed by comparing current (2013) and historical (1967) vegetation
   data. Effects of experimental liming, using different levels of lime
   addition (0, 1000, 2000, and 4000 kg Dolokal/ha), were monitored in the
   field during 7.5 years. Summer mowing led to more acidic and
   nutrient-poor conditions as indicated by a shift from rich to poor fen
   vegetation, including a well-developed bryophyte cover dominated by
   Sphagnum with some threatened species. Burning (after winter mowing)
   counteracted acidification but increased nutrient availability, as
   indicated by dominance of vascular species characteristic of productive
   tall-herb grasslands and a sparse bryophyte cover with common species.
   We conclude that the traditional measures were unable to maintain rich
   fen composition in the long term. Given the fact that the restoration of
   hydrological conditions, favouring rich fens, is not always feasible,
   liming could be an alternative to counteract acidification and improve
   rich fen conditions in the short term. This measure, however, appeared
   to be unsustainable as the re-establishment and dominance of Sphagnum
   spp. seriously complicated the development of rich fen vegetation in the
   longer term. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{76-82}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands are key habitats for biodiversity conservation
   in Central Europe. Shrub encroachment is one of the most threatening
   drivers of grassland degradation and affects soil properties,
   microclimate, and vegetation with possible impacts on higher trophic
   levels. We aimed to analyse the impact of shrub encroachment with broom
   (Cytisus scoparius) on carabid beetle diversity, species composition,
   and functional traits. In a field study on dry grasslands on the island
   of Hiddensee (Germany) we studied 15 sites along a gradient of
   increasing broom encroachment and classified them into three dry
   grassland types with low, medium, and high shrub cover. Our results
   provide evidence that shrub encroachment initially has positive effects
   on species richness and activity densities of dry grassland carabids.
   Carabid species composition differed among differently shrub-covered dry
   grassland types, and sites with low and high shrub cover were each
   characterised by unique carabid assemblages. The species composition of
   sites with a medium shrub biomass had a transitional character and
   contained species which are typical for open dry grassland, but also
   shared species with sites with a high shrub cover. Among functional
   trait parameters investigated, especially the body size of carabid
   beetles was related to environmental parameters associated with shrub
   encroachment. Body size was positively correlated to shrub biomass and
   soil humidity, but negatively to temperature. Eurytopy values of
   carabids were related to high litter cover, i.e. habitat generalist
   (eurytopic) species mainly occurred in densely shrub-encroached sites.
   In order to preserve unique carabid assemblages of open dry grasslands
   with stenotopic and smaller species, it is most important to prevent a
   shrub encroachment higher than about 60\% cover. For management we
   suggest extensive grazing (by cattle, sheep or horses) to prevent shrub
   encroachment on dry grasslands. In areas with high shrub cover
   additionally the use of goats or mechanical removal of shrubs might be
   necessary. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems is affected by various
   factors such as plant diversity and insect herbivory. While several
   studies suggest insect herbivory to depend on plant diversity, their
   interacting effect on nutrient cycling is unclear. In a greenhouse
   experiment with grassland microcosms of one to six plant species of two
   functional groups (grasses and legumes), we tested the influence of
   plant species richness (diversity) and functional composition on plant
   community biomass production, insect foliar herbivory, soil microbial
   biomass, and nutrient concentrations in throughfall. To manipulate
   herbivory, zero, three or six generalist grasshoppers (Chorthippus
   parallelus) were added to the plant communities. Increasing plant
   species richness increased shoot biomass and grasshopper performance,
   without significantly affecting root biomass or insect herbivory. Plant
   functional composition affected all of these parameters, e.g. legume
   communities showed the highest shoot biomass, the lowest grasshopper
   performance and suffered the least herbivory. Nutrient concentrations
   (dissolved mineral N, PO4-P, SO4-S) and pH in throughfall increased with
   herbivory. PO4-P and pH increases were positively affected by plant
   diversity, especially under high herbivore pressure. Plant functional
   composition affected several throughfall variables, sometimes fully
   explaining diversity effects. Increasing plant diversity tended to
   increase soil microbial biomass, but only under high herbivore pressure.
   Faeces quantities strongly correlated with changes in pH and PO4-P;
   frass may therefore be an important driver of throughfall pH and a main
   source of PO4-P released from living plants. Our results indicate that
   insect herbivory may significantly influence fast nutrient cycling
   processes in natural communities, particularly so in managed grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{In desertified regions, the mobile sand land, and afforested shrubland
   of different ages (i.e., 6, 15, 24 and 36 years) in addition to the
   naturally restored grassland were selected in order to evaluate their
   consequences on taxonomic and trophic structures, and the diversity of
   ground-active arthropods. The taxa-specific responses to the land
   conversion were found within functional groups. The activity density of
   predator Labiduridae and Carabidae, and herbivore Tenebrionidae
   decreased, while that of herbivore Melolonthidae and omnivore Formicidae
   increased markedly (p < 0.05) from the mobile sand land to the
   afforested shrubland, regardless of shrubland ages. The taxa richness of
   herbivores also increased markedly (p < 0.05) from the mobile sand land
   to the afforested shrubland, regardless of shrubland ages. However,
   there was little effect of land conversion on the activity density and
   richness of detritivores due to the lack of litter on the surface of
   soils. Different functional groups of ground-active arthropods responded
   in a different way to the land conversion. The total density and Simpson
   index decreased, while the taxa richness and Shannon index increased
   markedly (p < 0.05) from the mobile sand land to afforested shrubland,
   regardless of shrubland ages. It was suggested that the afforested shrub
   plantations of different ages had similar implications on the trophic
   structure and diversity indices as was close to the naturally restored
   grassland (except for Shannon index). The Shannon index in the grazed
   afforested shrubland of 24 years that was close to the naturally
   restored grassland was markedly (p < 0.05) lower compared with the other
   afforested plantations. In conclusion, the afforested shrubland was an
   option for the stabilization of mobile sand land and biodiversity
   recovery of degraded ecosystems, regardless of shrub ages. Furthermore,
   the grazing management on afforested shrubland could improve the
   effectiveness of this recovery process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Species richness, composition, and functional traits of carabid beetle
   assemblages (Coleoptera: Carabidae) were studied in relation to
   different grassland management. Carabid beetles were sampled during the
   summers 2008 and 2009 by 165 traps located in 11 sites in the
   central-eastern Italian Alps. Using mixed effect models to account for
   potential spatial bias, we found that mown grasslands had significantly
   more species, a lower proportion of wingless species and a lower
   proportion of species with long larval development than grazed and
   natural grasslands. Within grazed and mown grasslands, neither cattle
   density nor number of cuts had any significant effect neither on species
   richness nor on any of the traits. The influence of grassland management
   can be summarised as follows: (1) grazing does not change community
   structure and functional traits compared to natural grasslands; (2)
   mowing negatively affects the carabid beetle assemblages; (3) the
   intensity of grazing and of cutting may not affect the structure of
   species assemblages of ground beetles. Our results support the
   hypothesis that agroecosystem practices in alpine grasslands influence
   carabid beetle communities. Specifically, the species with traits
   typical of undisturbed habitats (low dispersal abilities and long larval
   development) are more sensitive to perturbations (e.g. cutting). Our
   suggestion for agricultural and environmental planning and for
   conservation schemes is that the preservation of natural grasslands
   (e.g. forest gaps) and the implementation of grazing should be promoted
   during the planning of agroecosystem mosaics.}},

Month = {{JAN 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: `Scrub-grassland' mosaics are valued owing to their notable
   biodiversity. However, they are dynamic and difficult to manage, largely
   because of our incomplete knowledge of vegetation boundary shifts.
   Aim: Increase our understanding of the ecological processes involved in
   woody plant establishment at scrub-grassland ecotones and assess whether
   current management practices in a reserve (Cressbrook Dale, UK) are
   controlling scrub encroachment.
   Methods: Vegetation structure, seed deposition and seedling density were
   studied for woody species across the scrub-grassland interface.
   Seedlings of successful colonisers were planted in the grassland to
   assess their palatability and susceptibility to grazers.
   Results: Vegetation structure changed radically at the scrub-grassland
   interface. Woody plant canopy cover decreased more sharply than did the
   density of woody species. Seed deposition was much higher within the
   scrub than in the grassland (71.3 vs. 9.0 seeds m(-2) year(-1)). Corylus
   avellana and Crataegus monogyna were the most successful grassland
   colonisers, with Corylus being less palatable but less resistant to
   grazing.
   Conclusions: Although the current grazing regime is stopping scrub
   encroachment, there is a notable density of stunted woody plants in the
   grassland adjacent to the scrub, their growth suppressed by grazers.
   This incipient scrub could rapidly become closed scrub if grazing
   pressure were relaxed.}},

Abstract = {{The interest for goats rearing has increased during last decades on the
   Italian Alps. However, feeding preferences by grazing goats have not
   undergone detailed investigation in extensive montane grazing systems.
   Our study aimed to assess plant species selection by integrating
   vegetation surveys with animal GPS tracking under two contrasting alpine
   vegetation communities: a semi-natural grassland (SG) and a grazable
   forestland (GF). Goats selected a high array of plant species (56 and 47
   species in the SG and GF, respectively), but most of their diet was
   composed by a few species (ten species accounted for 95\% and 91\% of
   the total species intake in the SG and GF, respectively). The selection
   by goats seemed to be more species-dependent rather than functional
   group-dependent. Goats appeared to be less selective within a
   homogeneous herbaceous grassland, because they selected plant species
   proportionally to their abundance (P=0.05). Conversely, in a
   heterogeneous and stratified grazable forestland they showed a more
   pronounced preference for most of the browse species, regardless of
   species abundance. Plant species selection was positively correlated
   with species height in both vegetation communities (P<0.001). Despite
   this selective behaviour, animal stocking density played a key role in
   the selection of many species and this result suggests that animal
   management (i.e., implementation of different stocking rates and
   densities) could be an important tool in modifying diet selection,
   promoting the consumption of particular plant species and thus managing
   the dynamics of plant communities in alpine environments.}},

   results seem to indicate that a mild management of set-asides,
   consisting in mowing once a year (mid July in the examined areas), may
   enhance faunal diversity, above all Arthropod diversity. After mowing,
   the set-asides managed following Standard 4.2, hosted higher levels of
   Arthropod diversity and a more balanced faunistic composition in
   comparison to unmoved set-asides and arable lands. On the contrary, we
   did not find significant effects of mowing on lizard abundance. We also

Volume = {{7}},
Abstract = {{In biodiversity experiments based on seeded experimental communities,
   species richness and species composition exert a strong influence on
   canopy structure and can lead to an improved use of aboveground
   resources. In this study, we want to explore whether these findings are
   applicable to agriculturally managed permanent grassland. Vertical
   layered profiles of biomass, leaf area (LA) and light intensity were
   measured in a removal-type biodiversity experiment (GrassMan) to compare
   the canopy structure in grassland vegetation of different plant species
   composition (called sward types). Additionally, the altered sward types
   were subjected to four different management regimes by a combination of
   the factors fertilization (unfertilized, NPK fertilized) and cutting
   frequency (one late cut or three cuts). In spite of large compositional
   differences (ratio grasses : non-leguminous forbs : leguminous forbs
   ranging from 93 : 7 : 0 to 39 : 52 : 9), the vegetation of the same
   management regime hardly differed in its canopy structure, whereas the
   different management regimes led to distinct vertical profiles in the
   vegetation. However, the allocation of biomass in response to cutting
   and fertilization differed among the sward types. Vegetation dominated
   by grasses was denser and had more LA when fertilized compared with
   vegetation rich in dicots which merely grew taller. In functionally more
   diverse vegetation, light interception was not increased compared with
   vegetation consisting of more than 90 \% of grasses in terms of biomass.
   Management had a much stronger influence on structure and light
   interception than plant species composition in this grassland

   treatments: no grazing, light grazing, moderate grazing and heavy
   grazing in the Loess Plateau of northwestern China. We found that
   diversity indices of bacterial 16S rDNA increased with grazing
   intensity, suggesting that disturbance led to higher bacterial
   diversity. The bacterial community structure, measured as species

Abstract = {{This work aims at evaluating the impacts of climate change on pastoral
   resources located along the Apennines chain. To this end, random forest
   machine learning model was first calibrated for the present period and
   then applied to future conditions, as projected by HadCM3 general
   circulation model, in order to simulate possible spatial variation/shift
   of pastoral areas in two time slices (centred on 2050 and 2080) under A2
   and B2 SRES scenarios. Pre-existent spatial database. namely Corine land
   cover map and WorldClim were integrated and harmonised in a GIS
   environment in order to extract climate variables (mean seasonal
   precipitation, mean maximum temperature of the warmest month and minimum
   temperature of the coldest month) and response variables
   (presence/absence of pastures) to be used as model predictors. Random
   forest model resulted robust and coherent to simulate pastureland
   suitability under current climatology (classification accuracy
   error=19\%). Accordingly, results indicated that increases in
   temperatures coupled with decreases in precipitation, as simulated by
   HadCM3 in the future would have impacts of great concern on potential
   pasture distribution. In the specific, an overall decline of
   pasturelands suitability is predicted by the middle of the century in
   both A2 (-46\%) and B2 (-41\%) along the entire chain. However, despite
   alarming reductions in pastures suitability along the northern (-69\%
   and -71\% under A2 and B2 scenarios respectively) and central Apennines
   (-90\% under both scenarios) by the end of the century, expansions are
   predicted along the southern areas of the chain (+96\% and +105\% under
   A2 and B2 scenarios, respectively). This may be probably due to
   expansions in pastures dominated by xeric and thermophiles species,
   which will likely benefit from warmer and drier future conditions
   predicted in the southern zone of the chain by the HadCM3. Hence, the
   expected climate, coupled with an increasing abandonment of the
   traditional grazing practices. will likely threat grassland biodiversity
   as well as pastoral potential distribution currently, dominating the

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{The vegetation of fire-prone landscapes is influenced by the frequency,
   severity, seasonality, return interval and stochastic patterning of fire
   as well as the responses of its component species. An expected increase
   in fire frequency and severity in association with global warming may
   result in compositional changes within, and spatial reorganisation of,
   plant communities; indeed, some plant communities may even face
   extinction. Vegetation dominated by fire-sensitive species may be most
   vulnerable to change in fire frequency. A landscape-scale fire in
   Kosciuszko National Park in 2003 provided an opportunity to compare
   recovery in vegetation dominated by resprouters and fire-sensitive,
   obligate seeders. We hypothesised that if plant assemblages had failed
   to recover after 10 years in terms of species richness and cover they
   would have been dominated by seeder species pre-fire. After 10 years,
   two of the six vegetation types investigated had recovered and these
   were indeed dominated by resprouter species. Two groundwater-dependent
   vegetation types (one resprouter-dominated and one dominated by
   fire-sensitive species) were close to recovery. However, the other two
   types, non-groundwater-dependent shrublands dominated by both seeder and
   resprouter species, were still far from recovery at that time, with
   shrub cover reduced and grass cover increased. The likelihood of
   recovery after 10 years therefore does not appear to be solely a
   consequence of the regeneration strategies of the dominant species.
   Post-fire environmental factors (e.g. grazing, disease, climate) may be
   just as important as regeneration strategies in determining recovery
   time. Because not all vegetation had recovered after 10 years,
   prediction of minimum tolerable fire intervals at a landscape scale is
   impossible at this time. Future fire management needs to be adaptive,
   taking into account post-fire influences, rather than prescriptive.}},

Abstract = {{We performed a survey of grassland communities in the Ukrainian
   Carpathians with the aim of: (1) syntaxonomically classifying the meso-
   and subxerophilous grassland vegetation; (2) analysing the main
   gradients in their species composition; (3) estimating the effect of
   selected environmental factors on grassland species composition; (4)
   assessing the species richness of vascular plants and bryophytes in
   relation to the measured environmental variables. We collected 46
   phytosociological releves during the growing seasons of 2010 and 2011.
   Species composition and species richness were studied at two spatial
   scales (1 m(2) and 16 m(2)) in relation to soil parameters (soil depth,
   pH (KCl), content of P, K, mg, N and C), management regime (mowing,
   grazing, ploughing in the past and burning), and other factors
   (altitude, litter cover, open soil, inclination, solar radiation and
   animal excrement). Seven grassland types were distinguished belonging to
   3 classes and 4 alliances, namely the Nardetea strictae including the
   Violion caninae (mesic pastures at altitudes of 400-600 m mostly on
   moderate slopes) and the Nardo strictae-Agrostion tennis (grasslands on
   moderate slopes at altitudes of 700-900 m usually managed by mowing and
   grazing the aftermath); the Molinio-Arrhenatheretea, including the
   Arrhenatherion elatioris (submontane grasslands originated mostly on
   former fields after their abandonment in the past) and the Cynosurion
   cristati (intensive pastures); and the Festuco-Brometea including the
   Cirsio-Brachypodion pinnati (abandoned grasslands dominated by
   Brachypodium pinnatum and Inula salicina). Detrended correspondence
   analysis indicated that the major compositional turnover was related to
   altitude and soil reaction. A canonical correspondence analysis
   confirmed that altitude had the strongest effect on species composition
   in the analysed dataset, followed by management treatments (former
   ploughing, grazing intensity). For vascular plant species richness,
   regression tree analysis identified grazing intensity as the most
   important predictor at the 1 m(2) scale. At the 16 m(2) scale, soil
   humus content was evaluated as the most important predictor of vascular
   plant species richness, followed by litter cover and grazing intensity.
   The number of bryophytes was not determined by the studied environmental
   factors at either of the two spatial scales. Although the number of
   analysed releves in this study was limited, our results significantly
   contribute to the understanding of submontane grasslands in the
   Ukrainian Carpathians.}},

   relation to grazing regime and land use history}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{35}},
Pages = {{399-416}},
Abstract = {{Steppes used to cover large areas of Hungary, but most of this
   vegetation has since been destroyed. In Central Hungary, some patches
   have survived on ridges in wet meadows. These habitat complexes face
   profound land use changes and their optimal management regime is
   uncertain. We identified seven annually mown steppe and wet meadow types
   according to their grazing regime and history and aimed to answer the
   following questions: (1) Does grazing have beneficial effects on mown
   steppes and wet meadows? (2) Should the presently homogeneous management
   of neighbouring steppes and wet meadows be maintained? (3) Is annual
   mowing sufficient in assisting the recovery of steppes and wet meadows
   on former croplands?
   We selected three localities for each of the seven vegetation types and
   sampled them with 50 quadrats (50 x 50 cm) in each locality, making a
   total of 1,050 quadrats. Vascular plant diversity relations were
   evaluated using the total number of species per habitat type (species
   richness) and the average number of species per quadrat (microsite
   diversity). The effect of grazing and history on microsite diversity was
   tested with linear mixed-effect models. We used Redundancy Analysis to
   disentangle the role of grazing intensity and management history on
   species composition. Plant species were then sorted into functional
   groups, and the proportions of these groups were used to evaluate
   community structure.
   Our results indicate that mowing alone cannot maintain as high a
   diversity as the combination of the two land use types, thus grazing
   should be introduced to non-grazed areas. Steppes, however, were found
   more sensitive to the intensity of grazing than wet meadows. Under heavy
   grazing, no increased microsite diversity was detected in the steppes
   and the proportion of disturbance indicators tended to increase. In
   contrast, the same grazing intensity resulted in only positive effects
   in wet meadows. Thus, uniform land use on adjacent steppes and wet
   meadows is not recommended but intensive grazing should be stopped on
   steppes. Secondary steppes were less diverse than primary ones and their
   community structure was also poorer, whereas wet meadows had a better
   regeneration potential. Thus, mowing alone is an incomplete tool to
   restore the plant diversity of secondary steppes; they should also be
   grazed and/or should be supported by other active interventions.}},

Abstract = {{The hump-back relationship between species diversity and productivity
   predicts highest species richness at intermediate levels of biomass, and
   low species numbers in least and most productive habitats. Sodic patches
   of semi-arid savannas are considered `nutrient hotspots' by producing
   high-quality forage. The impact of biomass reduction (due to
   overgrazing) and accumulation (in the absence of herbivores) on
   herbaceous species richness and diversity is still unknown for these
   hotspots. We tested the relationship between biomass and herbaceous
   species richness/diversity in savanna sodic sites across varying biomass
   levels obtained through different herbivore exclosures. LOWESS and
   quadratic regression analyses revealed a unimodal species
   richness/diversity-biomass relationship for biomass < 2 500 kg ha(-1).
   Species richness and diversity in the sodic zone peaked at 1 300 kg
   ha(-1), followed by a steady decline. At biomass levels exceeding 2 500
   kg ha(-1), i.e. where herbivores have been excluded for 10 years, the
   decline in species richness and diversity stabilised. Despite many
   debates surrounding unimodal relationships and the intermediate
   disturbance hypothesis, this study confirmed a peak in species richness
   and diversity at intermediate biomass levels in a herbivory-adapted
   ecosystem. Herbivores drive ecosystem heterogeneity and enhance
   herbaceous species richness and diversity by keeping biomass at
   intermediate levels (i.e. < 2 500 kg ha(-1) for this sodic site).}},

Abstract = {{Grazing could alter plant primary production and carbon (C) storage in
   Alpine meadow ecosystems. The grazing optimization hypothesis (GOH)
   suggests that aboveground net primary production increases at a moderate
   grazing intensity. In this study, GOH was tested by investigating the
   responses of plant production and ecosystem C storage to grazing
   intensity. The results indicated that both the root biomass and total
   biomass reached the highest values in moderate grazing (MG), and the
   species richness, root to shoot ratio (R:S ratio) increased in MG,
   suggesting that more assimilates allocated from aboveground to
   belowground under MG. Similar plant material carbon concentrations were
   observed for all of the grazing intensities (i.e., 40-50\%), and the
   soil organic carbon (SOC) storage depended on the root biomass. The soil
   organic C storage and ecosystem C storage both peaked with MG, which
   supported GOH. Thus, moderate grazing promoted ecosystem C sequestration
   by altering the plant community structure, plant production and R: S
   ratio in the Alpine grassland.}},

Abstract = {{The Flooding Pampas is the most important livestock region of Argentina,
   but is a region where replacement of originally natural, perennial
   tussock grasses by pasture species is changing the heterogeneity of the
   grassland system. We evaluated the response of grassland bird
   assemblages of the Flooding Pampas to planting of Lotus tenuis (Lotus)
   pasture, which mainly modifies vegetation structure by reducing vertical
   heterogeneity. Species richness and abundance of birds were compared
   between fields of Lotus pasture and semi-natural grasslands. Avian
   species richness and abundance were both greater in semi-natural
   grassland than in Lotus pasture. When grouped by nesting habits
   (grassland specialists, generalists), species richness and abundance of
   grassland specialists was greater in semi-natural grassland, whereas
   richness and abundance of generalist species was greater in Lotus
   pasture. An indicator-species analysis showed that five grassland birds
   were closely linked to semi-natural grassland vegetation, with two of
   those species - Hudson's Canastero (Asthenes hudsoni) and Bay-capped
   Wren-Spinetail (Spartonoica maluroides) of conservation concern. 1 In
   contrast, generalist species, such as Southern Lapwings (Vanellus
   chilensis) and Burrowing Owls (Athene cunicularia), were associated with
   Lotus pasture. Planting of Lotus pasture has negative effects on species
   that naturally occur in tussock grassland. Grassland management methods,
   such as intercropping and rotational grazing, could help reconcile the
   effects of livestock production and the conservation grassland bird
   conservation in the Flooding Pampas.}},

Abstract = {{The sheep industry has played an important role in Australia's
   development and economy over the 220 years since European settlement and
   remains an important land use in Australia, occupying an estimated 85
   million ha of continental land mass. Historically, deforestation was
   carried out in many sheep-rearing regions to promote pasture growth but
   this has not occurred within recent decades and many wool producers have
   invested in planting trees as well as preserving patches of remnant
   vegetation. Although the limitations of single environmental impact
   studies are recognised, this paper focuses on the contribution of carbon
   sequestration in trees and shrubs on sheep farms to the global warming
   potential impact category in life cycle assessment of wool. The analysis
   represents three major wool-producing zones of Australia. Based on
   default regional yields as applied in Australia's National Inventory
   model, FullCAM, CO2 removals in planted exotic pines and mixed native
   species were estimated to be 5.0 and 3.0 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1),
   respectively, for the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales in the
   `high-rainfall zone' and 1.4 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for mixed native
   species in the `sheep-wheat zone' of Western Australia. Applying
   modified factors allowing for the higher measured growth rates in
   regions with rainfall >300 mm, gave values for native species
   reforestation of 4.4 and 2.0 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) for New South Wales
   and Western Australia, respectively. Sequestration was estimated to be
   0.07 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) over 100 years for chenopod shrublands of the
   `pastoral zone' of South Australia but this low rate is significant
   because of the extent of regeneration. Sequestration of soil organic
   carbon in improved permanent pastures in the New South Wales Northern
   Tablelands was evaluated to be highly uncertain but potentially
   significant over large areas of management. Improved data and consistent
   methodologies are needed for quantification of these benefits in life
   cycle assessment studies for wool and sheep meat, and additional impact
   categories, such as biodiversity, need to be included if the public and
   private benefits provided by good management of vegetation resources on
   farms are to be more fully recognised.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by large herbivores may have a strong impact on plant diversity

   four different stocking rates of Tibetan sheep {[}no grazing, light (2.4

   sheep units ha(-1)) grazing] in a 5-year (2006-2010) grazing experiment
   on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. Herbage mass and aboveground net
   primary productivity of alpine steppe declined significantly with
   increasing stocking rate (P < 0.05). Over the 5 years of the experiment,
   the proportion of forbs and sedges increased significantly under light
   and moderate grazing; the proportion of grasses decreased significantly,
   whereas the proportion of S. purpurea did not change compared with the
   no grazing treatment. Species diversity was highest under moderate
   grazing and was significantly higher than the no grazing treatment in 2
   years (2008 and 2010). Moderate grazing enhanced the species diversity
   of the plant community due to an increase in the proportion of forbs.
   There were significant positive linear correlations between herbage mass
   and species diversity under no and light grazing. Species diversity was
   not related to productivity under moderate and heavy grazing. In
   conclusion, grazing by sheep reduced plant productivity; plant diversity
   increased under low and moderate grazing, and was as a result of changes

Abstract = {{Nassella trichotoma (Nees) Hack. ex Arechav. (common name, serrated
   tussock) occupies large areas of south-eastern Australia and has
   considerable scope for expansion in the Northern Tablelands of New South
   Wales. This highly invasive grass reduces pasture productivity and has
   the potential to severely affect the region's economy by decreasing the
   livestock carrying capacity of grazing land. Other potential
   consequences of this invasion include increased fuel loads and
   displacement of native plants, thereby threatening biodiversity. Rural
   property owners in the Northern Tablelands were sent a mail
   questionnaire that examined use of measures to prevent new outbreaks of
   the weed. The questionnaire was sent to professional farmers as well as
   lifestyle farmers (owners of rural residential blocks and hobby farms)
   and 271 responses were obtained (a response rate of 18\%). Key findings
   were respondents' limited capacity to detect N. trichotoma, and low
   adoption of precautions to control seed spread by livestock, vehicles
   and machinery. This was particularly the case among lifestyle farmers.
   There have been considerable recent changes to biosecurity governance
   arrangements in New South Wales, and now is an ideal time for regulators

Abstract = {{The northern slopes of the Central Great Caucasus of Georgia were
   covered by birch (Betula litwinowii) forests in the past, but forest
   degradation resulted in subalpine secondary meadows. Over the past 20
   years birch forest natural reforestation processes have taken place. The
   aim of this study was to determine the changes in plant species
   diversity during reforestation. Different habitat types were selected to
   trace the development of birch forests from subalpine meadows. Species
   richness was determined in 100 research plots (25 m(2) each) of
   different habitat types. Pioneer succession was distinguished by the
   highest level of species richness due to the mixture of two habitat
   types. Degraded forest showed the lowest species richness. At the
   initial stages of forest restoration we observed several species of
   subalpine dwarf shrubs. They grow only in open canopy areas and are
   absent in closed forests. The alpine treeline habitat type and pioneer
   succession of subalpine meadows revealed close relations in species
   composition and diversity. These similarities show forest restoration in
   lower elevations as it is restricted in the treeline ecotone by local
   climatic conditions. The natural regeneration is apparently in close
   relation with the global climate change, but the most important factor
   is the reduction of uncontrolled sheep grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing systems in the high Himalayas are changing in response to
   socioeconomic factors and policy decisions. As well as effects on

   were to explore how plant species richness and composition respond to
   livestock grazing in the high Himalayan rangelands. The study was
   conducted in three mountainous Protected Areas of Nepal viz. Sagarmatha
   (Mt Everest) National Park, Gaurishankar Conservation Area and Khaptad
   National Park. Species and environmental data were collected along
   perpendicular transects outwards from goths (semi-permanent stopping and
   camping points). It was found that the distance from goths generally
   represents a grazing disturbance gradient. The core areas near goths had
   low species richness per plot (alpha-diversity) where nitrophilous and
   grazing-tolerant species were commonly found. However, the highest
   species richness, total numbers of species and occurrences of rare
   species at mid- and farther distances from goths within 800m suggest
   that negative effects of summer livestock grazing were small and
   confined to limited areas near goths. Altitude, soil moisture content,
   percentage shrub cover and distance from goths were the variables
   significantly correlated with species composition, although the relative
   importance of these factors varied across study sites. This research can
   be used to inform decision-making about seasonal livestock grazing in
   the Himalayan rangelands, which should incorporate both ecological as

Abstract = {{Since the contribution of total belowground bud bank and different bud
   types to community regeneration has rarely been explored, the vegetative
   offspring recruited from different belowground bud types was
   investigated in four plant communities along a grassland degradation
   gradient in northeastern China (Inner Mongolia). This gradient, between
   1000 and 1500 m a.s.l., has been caused by overgrazing. It is a Leymus
   chinensis steppe which occupies about 3.0x10(5) ha. Recruitment from
   tiller buds was dominant (>80\%) in determining the total vegetative
   offspring density along the whole grassland degradation gradient.
   However, the proportional contribution of tiler-ramets to total ramet
   recruitment was significantly greater (P <0.05) during earlier than
   later stages of grassland degradation, while that of rhizome-ramets
   showed an opposite pattern. While the percentage contribution and

Abstract = {{Due to decrease in the area of extensively managed, semi-natural

   conversion of highly productive meadows to extensively managed,
   species-rich grasslands is now regarded as an important task for nature
   conservation. The aim of this long-term study was to assess the
   significance of restoration measures for diversity and trophic structure
   of above-ground insect community That study challenges some weaknesses
   of previous studies as it was conducted with the use of suction trap
   enabling quantitative analyses of the changes in most insect taxa, and
   in a long time-span (1992-2005) in a set of permanent plots. The study
   area was located in a subalpine zone in Bavaria, near Laufen (Germany).
   The restoration process was initiated in 1996 by a cessation of
   fertilization and reduction of number of mowing to 1-2 per year. The
   changes in insect density and diversity (number of families) were
   monitored in ten restored and two reference plots with the aid of a
   suction trap. The changes in the insect community recorded during 14
   years support findings from other studies that response of insect
   community to restoration process is usually slow on average. The
   short-term comparison in 2004-2005 between the restored and reference
   plots show that the first ones were characterized by more diverse (in
   term of family number) insect communities (as a whole as well as in
   guilds of predatory and parasitic species). From the other side, the
   long-term trend analysis shows that since 1998-2000 insect diversity and
   abundance was declining. Also trophic structure is fluctuating without
   clearly defined trend. These findings are in line with the results of
   the analyses of taxonomic composition similarity They did not support
   the expectations neither that difference between initial and current
   taxonomical composition in a restored plot increases in time (mainly
   because of incoming new species), nor that spatial heterogeneity of
   insect assemblages should increase. However, spatio-temporal insect
   interactions between sample plots (located close to each other), linked
   to high movement ability of many insect taxa, could mask the changes in

   indicated that the manual mowing effect could be rapid. In comparison
   with the surrounding landscape, we found that: (i) the manually mowed
   site was most similar to strictly protected area, (ii) some species of
   high conservation value could reach higher abundance in restored than
   protected site, and (iii) manual mowing could bring a new type of
   habitat (i.e., spatial heterogeneity) compared to the other management
   types (abandonment, conservation and agri-environmental mowing). The
   main implication seems to be optimistic for practice: The manual mowing
   of long-term abandoned fen is leading to the creation of habitat with

Volume = {{68}},

Abstract = {{Landscapes are complex creative systems that continually transform due
   to ever-changing relationships among environments and organisms
   including human beings. During the past half-century, those who study
   these relationships and those who manage them have become increasingly
   isolated from one another in their attempts to understand and manage
   landscapes. As we have come to rely on experimental science to
   understand principles, we have diminished the importance of experiential
   knowledge in understanding and implementing practices. In this paper, we
   discuss convergence of the knowledge of herders from Southeastern France
   with the science of foraging behavior. We review insights of researchers
   gained through interviews with herders, surveys, and in situ recordings
   of the foraging behavior of closely herded sheep and goats. Though years
   of hands-on experience, herders have come to understand processes
   involved in food and habitat selection. Using a conceptual model of four
   steps, which represent four intertwined processes for a given
   herder-herd-fodder resource, we describe how herders 1) teach their
   animals to use the full range of forages, 2) train the herd to respect
   the boundaries of grazing areas, 3) modulate what they call the
   ``temporary palatability scoring{''} of forages, and 4) establish daily
   grazing circuits to stimulate appetite and intake through meal
   sequencing. This knowledge is also valuable when the objective is to
   boost appetite for particular forages, such as coarse grasses, scrub,
   and invasive species. The practices of herders are consistent with
   scientific studies that show the importance of plant biodiversity for
   enabling animals to select nutritious diets and the significance of

Abstract = {{In this study, the impacts of cattle grazing with differing grazing
   rates on species composition, canopy structural traits, standing crop of
   canopy biomass, and plant species diversity were examined in a meadow
   steppe of the Hulunber grasslands, Northeastern China. Six stocking-rate
   treatments (0, 0.23, 0.34, 0.46, 0.69, and 0.92 AU.ha(-1)) with three
   replicates were established, and observations were conducted from 2009
   to 2011. Our findings demonstrate that short-term grazing substantially
   altered the species composition and relative dominance, standing crop of
   aboveground biomass, and canopy structural traits, whereas no
   significant changes in species diversity and evenness occurred in
   response to different-rated grazing in this meadow steppe, which has a
   long-term evolutionary grazing history and high-resources
   availabilities. We found that perennial graminoid significantly
   decreased, while forbs and annuals increased at the same time, with
   increasing grazing intensity and duration; canopy height and coverage
   decreased substantially with increasing stocking rates, whereas
   significant changes in plant density occurred only at heavy grazing in
   the second and third years; and significant negative linear relations
   were found between the standing crop of biomass and grazing intensity in
   each individual year or for 3 years on average. Significantly highest
   species richness and canopy dominance occurred only at the intermediate
   grazing rate in the third year, and intermediate grazing intensity also
   maintained a highly constant standing crop of canopy biomass in the 3
   years, all being in accordance with the intermediate disturbance
   hypothesis. Our findings imply that monitoring changes in species
   composition, canopy traits, and standing crop of biomass in grassland
   communities can provide important references for assessing current
   grazing management scenarios and conducting timely adaptive practices to
   maintain the long-term ability of grassland systems to perform their
   ecological functions. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of

Abstract = {{Ecological theory suggests that several nested environmental filters,
   acting at different spatial scales, shape the assemblages of local plant
   species. However, it is unclear whether different biodiversity
   components, that is, taxonomy, function and phylogenetic, respond
   similarly to these filters. The integration of these different
   components into coherent and comprehensive analytical frameworks also
   remains unclear. In this study, we developed an approach to test the
   relative effects of elevation, habitat fragmentation and grazing
   management on the functional, phylogenetic, and taxonomic structures of
   mountain pastures. Thirty summer farms, distributed along an elevational
   gradient were surveyed in the Italian Alps. Within these farms (around
   100 ha), we identified all areas as one of two types of management
   (intensive or extensive), and we sampled three plots for each area, a
   total of 180 plots. Using the same mathematical framework, we quantified
   the functional (FD), phylogenetic (PD) and taxonomic (TD) diversity of
   each plot. We tested the influences of three environmental filters
   (elevation, habitat fragmentation and grazing management), using a
   series of partial regression analyses within a univariate and
   multivariate framework, as well as specific permutation schemes that
   accounted for our nested design. We found that elevation, habitat
   fragmentation, and grazing management affected the community structure,
   but in different ways. This finding confirmed that these filters operate
   at different scales and, despite some similarities, have different
   effects on various biodiversity components. Interestingly, FD was the
   only component that responded to all three types of predictors.
   Regarding functional aspects, elevation, as a broad-scale environmental
   gradient, showed a greater influence on dominant trait values, whereas
   at finer scales, grazing management had a primary effect on both
   dominant trait values and diversity measures. Habitat fragmentation
   showed a primary influence on TD, probably because the effect on
   dispersal limitations concerned mostly species availability. The
   hierarchical, multi-faceted approach adopted in this study yielded
   insights into the factors influencing biodiversity and community
   assembly processes in mountain pastures, thereby highlighting the
   importance of considering multiple facets of diversity in assessing the
   role of environmental filtering in vegetation structure. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Saltmarshes of Spartina densiflora in south-eastern South America have

   livestock. We examined the effect of the intensity of cattle production
   on the structure of saltmarsh vegetation and the effect of these changes
   to vegetation on the richness, composition and size of the avian
   populations and the abundance of nests. The levels of cattle production
   were based on the combined intensity of prescribed burning and cattle
   grazing, classed as: (1) High grazing - High burning (HH), (2) Low
   grazing - Low burning (LL) and (3) No grazing - No burning (NN). Cattle
   production altered the vegetation structure of saltmarshes and
   indirectly modified the richness, composition and size of their avian
   populations and the abundance of nests. Saltmarshes with either LL or NN
   production levels were inhabited by tall grassland specialists and
   generalists and by species specialised to live in a mosaic of short and
   tall grassland patches. Conversely, saltmarshes with HH production
   levels were inhabited by short-grassland specialists. That avian species
   diversity does not differ between S. densiflora saltmarsh subject to low
   or no human impacts has several potential interpretations, which are
   discussed. These findings have implications for management of grasslands

Abstract = {{The Altun National Nature Reserve, located on the northern edge of the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of China, is one of 35 most important
   biodiversity sites worldwide. Land-use and cover change are affecting
   this alpine ecosystem. A supervised classification was used to classify
   types containing meadow, steppe, sparse rangeland, and non-rangeland
   environments based on Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery data. By
   conducting an aggregation analysis using a Geographic Information System
   an analysis of changes from 1990 to 2010 was conducted. The results
   demonstrated that sparse rangeland was the most widespread vegetation
   type and underwent significant changes over the period. The area of
   sparse rangeland increased by 64.4km(2) from 1990 to 1995 and by
   49.3km(2) from 1995 to 2000. However, the area of sparse rangeland
   decreased by 99.2km(2) from 2000 to 2005 and by 247.4km(2) from 2005 to
   2010. The major areas of change were primarily located in the vicinities
   of the Yishakipati central inspection station, the Kardun inspection
   station, and Ayakkum, Aqqikkol and Jingyu Lakes. There was a positive
   correlation between the change in area of sparse rangeland and the
   amount of livestock grazing. The change in non-rangeland was
   significantly negatively correlated with the amount of livestock grazing
   during the period in the grazing area. Appropriate livestock grazing may
   be essential for promoting the resilience of the predominant ecosystems
   and key habitats of wildlife in the Altun National Nature Reserve.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial patterns formed by thousands of red-brown fairy circles
   (FCs) amidst green or yellow Namib Desert grassland offer a majestic
   landscape view. These FCs are not simply circular gaps in the grass
   vegetation. Each of these bare circles forms an oasis that stores water
   in its soil even during extended periods of drought and over many years
   (Juergens 2013). Together with the surrounding belts of grass they form
   `fairy circle ecosystems' that enable perennial life of many organisms
   thereby increasing biodiversity by one or two magnitudes if compared to
   the surrounding desert (Juergens 2013). At the same time they are the
   subject of a scientific puzzle and an ongoing debate on the causation of
   the circles. Presently three main lines of interpretation see the bare
   patches a) as a result of a damage caused by toxic gases (Naude et al.
   2011), b) as a result of competition for scarce resources (Getzin et al.
   2014) or c) as a result of an ecosystem design by herbivorous sand
   termites (Juergens 2013). All these hypotheses have strengths and
   weaknesses the latter ones leading to a number of open questions. This

Title = {{Agricultural diversity to increase adaptive capacity and reduce
   vulnerability of livestock systems against weather variability - A
   farm-scale simulation study}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{199}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Greater diversity (i.e., variety, balance and disparity) within
   agricultural systems is often suggested as a solution to promote
   redundancy within such systems and therefore increase their adaptive
   capacity and reduce their vulnerability against climate change and
   variability. Yet this assumption relies upon the gathering and
   integration of field- and herd-scale results at the farm scale. We have
   conducted a farm-scale simulation-based study to evaluate the potential
   for increasing adaptive capacity and reducing vulnerability of livestock
   systems to weather variability through increase of their agricultural
   diversity. We manipulate in the simulation, factors of change in the
   livestock systems resulting in less diverse and more diverse livestock
   systems to be simulated. We assume, a priori, that certain combinations
   of the factored system components bring redundancy in the system and in
   turn increase its adaptive capacity and reduce its vulnerability against
   weather variability. Simulated factors of change are: F1: a change in
   the ratio of the area mechanically harvested (vs. grazed) to the whole
   farm area; F2: a change in the crops and grassland types grown or in the
   distribution of the area between crops and/or grassland types; F3: a
   change in calving periods from one season to another. The simulation
   plan includes a baseline scenario without changes and scenarios
   corresponding to all possible combinations of F1-F3. These scenarios are
   applied to four livestock systems located on a diagonal across France
   over a succession of four years with varying weather conditions. In
   these systems, self-sufficiency for forage is jeopardized by unfavorable
   years, and this may increase animal feeding costs. Thus we consider that
   adaptive capacity increases and vulnerability decreases as long as
   self-sufficiency for forage is achieved without increasing animal
   feeding costs. Results confirm the potential for increasing adaptive
   capacity and reducing vulnerability of livestock systems to weather
   variability through increase of their agricultural diversity. For
   instance, F2 has three main kinds of impacts on self-sufficiency for
   forage: (i) it yields significant average improvements by 34\%, 43\%,
   36\% and 36\% across livestock systems for the four successive years,
   (ii) it buffers year-to-year variations and (iii) the final level of
   self-sufficiency is higher than the initial one even after two years
   with unfavorable weather conditions. Moreover, simulated changes do not
   increase animal feeding costs. Thus our results provide empirical
   evidence at the farm scale to supplement literature reviews based on
   field- and herd-scale results. They also confirm that through easily
   implementable on-farm changes, adaptive capacity can be increased and
   vulnerability of agricultural systems to weather variability decreased.

Abstract = {{In this survey, we studied the response of plant functional traits to
   calcareous grassland restoration in the Calestienne region, Southern
   Belgium (restoration protocol: forest clear-cutting followed by grazing
   at all sites). We considered traits related to dispersal, establishment,
   and persistence that integrate the main challenges of plants to
   re-establish and survive in restored areas. Functional traits were
   compiled from databases and compared among (i) pre-restoration and young
   restoration forests; (ii) restoration areas of different ages; and (iii)
   old restorations and reference grasslands. The following questions were
   addressed: (i) What is the early response (2-4 years) in terms of plant
   functional trait following one restorative clear-cut event? (ii) What
   plants functional trait responses occur from restorative management
   (i.e., sheep and goat grazing)? (iii) Which differences still persist
   between the oldest restored parcels (10-15 years), and the historical
   reference grasslands? Forest clear-cuts induced several changes among
   functional traits, including decreased mean seed mass and certain
   vegetative traits (i.e., decreased phanerophytes, branching species; and
   increased short lifespan species i.e., annuals and biennials). During
   restorative management, clonal, epizoochorous and autumn germinating
   species were favored. Despite numerous other changes during this phase,
   many differences remained compared to reference grasslands. In
   particular, geophytes, mycorrhizal and evergreen species abundance were
   not approaching reference grassland values. The observed pattern helped
   to draw inferences on the possible mechanisms operating under vegetation
   recovery following restorative forest clear-cut and subsequent
   management were identified and described in this study. Results
   indicated grazing was an important factor, which increased epizoochorous
   species, and autumn germinating taxa that filled niches in vegetation
   opened by summer grazing animals. Finally, differences between old
   restoration and reference grasslands emphasized that management should
   focus on reduction in soil fertility, and geophyte rhizomatous grasses.
   Long-term monitoring is vital to assess if management plans are
   effective in the complete restoration of species functional trait
   assemblages. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{As a rule, communities consist of few abundant and many rare species,
   which is reflected in the characteristic shape of species abundance
   distributions (SADs). The processes that shape these SADs have been a
   longstanding problem for ecological research. Although many studies
   found strong negative effects of increasing land-use intensity on
   diversity, few reports consider land-use effects on SADs. Arthropods
   (insects and spiders) were sampled on 142 grassland plots in three
   regions in Germany, which were managed with different modes (mowing,
   fertilization and/or grazing) and intensities of land use. We analysed
   the effect of land use on three parameters characterizing the shape of
   SADs: abundance decay rate (the steepness of the rank abundance curve,
   represented by the niche-preemption model parameter), dominance
   (Berger-Parker dominance) and rarity (Fisher's alpha). Furthermore, we
   tested the core-satellite hypothesis by comparing the species' rank
   within the SAD to their distribution over the land-use gradient. When
   data on Araneae, Cicadina, Coleoptera, Heteroptera and Orthoptera were
   combined, abundance decay rate increased with combined land-use
   intensity (including all modes). Among the single land-use modes,
   increasing fertilization and grazing intensity increased the decay rate
   of all taxa, while increasing mowing frequency significantly affected
   the decay rate only in interaction with fertilization. Results of single
   taxa differed in their details, but all significant interaction effects
   included fertilization intensity. Dominance generally increased with
   increasing fertilization and rarity decreased with increasing grazing or
   mowing intensity, despite small differences among taxa and regions. The
   majority of species found on <10\% of the plots per region were
   generally rare (<10 individuals), which is in accordance with the
   core-satellite hypothesis. We found significant differences in the
   rarity and dominance of species between plots of low and high intensity
   for all three land-use modes and for the combined land-use intensity. We
   conclude that effects of land-use intensity on SADs lead to a stronger
   dominance of the most abundant species. Furthermore, species which have
   restricted distributions are more likely to also be rare species in the
   local SAD and therefore are at high risk of being lost under intensive
   land use.}},

Abstract = {{Institute, In ruminants, methane (CH4) is a by-product of digestion and
   contributes significantly to the greenhouse gas emissions attributed to
   agriculture. Grazed grass is a relatively cheap and nutritious feed but
   herbage species and nutritional quality vary between pastures, with
   management, land type and season all potentially impacting on animal
   performance and CH4 production. The objective of this study was to
   evaluate performance and compare CH4 emissions from cattle of dairy and

   0.05) in CH4 emissions per unit of feed intake when expressed either on
   a DM basis (20.7 and 21.6 g CH4 per kg DM intake for UG and LG,
   respectively) or as a percentage of the gross energy intake (6.0\% v.
   6.5\% for UG and LG, respectively). However, cattle grazing UG had
   significantly (P < 0.001) greater mean daily CH4 emissions than those
   grazing LG when expressed relative to BWG (261 v. 197 g CH4/kg,
   respectively). The greater DM intake and BWG of cattle grazing LG than
   UG reflected the poorer nutritive value of the UG grassland. Although
   absolute rates of CH4 emissions (g/day) were lower from cattle grazing
   UG than LG, cattle grazing UG would be expected to take longer to reach
   an acceptable finishing weight, thereby potentially off-setting this
   apparent advantage. Methane emissions constitute an adverse
   environmental impact of grazing by cattle but the contribution of cattle
   to ecosystem management (i.e. promoting biodiversity) should also be
   considered when evaluating the usefulness of different breeds for
   grazing semi-natural or unimproved grassland.}},

   habitat}},

Abstract = {{Fire is widely used as a management strategy in grasslands to maintain
   vegetation structure and improve grazing quality for large herbivores.
   The impacts of burning on invertebrates in South Africa remain poorly
   understood. A study was initiated in spring 2005 to determine the impact
   of a fast hot burn on ground-dwelling spider assemblages in a grassland
   habitat in the central Free State. Pitfall traps were set out at six
   sites in the reserve, with three sites each in the burnt and unburnt
   areas, to sample spiders over a 12-month period. A total of 5 253
   spiders were collected, representing 33 families and 120 species. Spider
   abundance was significantly lower in the burnt (n = 1 956) than unburnt
   sites (n = 3 297), and burnt sites had, on average, considerably fewer
   species than unburnt sites. The dominant families in the burnt sites
   were Lycosidae (29.5\%), Gnaphosidae (16.9\%), Ammoxenidae (9.6\%) and
   Zodariidae (5.7\%), whereas Ammoxenidae (22.7\%), Lycosidae (20.6\%),
   Gnaphosidae (15.3\%) and Amaurobiidae (10.2\%) dominated the unburnt
   sites. Of the nine most abundant families collected, only Caponiidae
   were more abundant in the burnt than unburnt sites. Our data suggest
   that fast-burning hot spring fires cause a considerable initial
   post-fire decline in spider abundance, and have a negative influence on
   the abundance as well as the resistance of assemblages to disturbances
   other than fire (e.g. rain). However, most of the dominant families had
   abundances comparable to unburnt areas within a year post-burn.}},

Title = {{Salix transect of Europe: latitudinal patterns in willow diversity from
   Greece to arctic Norway}},
Journal = {{BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Willows (Salix spp.) are ecosystem ``foundation species{''} that are
   hosts to large numbers of associated insects. Determining their patterns
   of distribution across Europe is therefore of interest for understanding
   the spatial distribution of associated fauna. The aim of this study was
   to record species composition at multiple sites on a long latitudinal
   gradient (megatransect) across Europe as a baseline for the future
   detailed analysis of insect fauna at these sites. In this way we used
   willow stands as comparable mesocosms in which to study floristic and
   faunistic changes with latitude across Europe.
   New information
   To determine spatial patterning of an ecologically important group on a
   latitudinal gradient across Europe, we sampled willows at the stand
   level in 42 sites, approximately 100 km apart, from the Aegean (38.8
   degrees N) to the Arctic Ocean (70.6 degrees N), but at a similar
   longitude (21.2 to 26.1 degrees E). The sites were predominantly lowland
   (elevations 1 to 556 metres amsl, median = 95 m) and wet (associated
   with rivers, lakes, drainage ditches or wet meadows). The median number
   of willow taxa (species and hybrids) per stand was four, and varied from
   one to nine. There is a progressive increase in willow diversity from
   south to north with the median number of taxa per stand in southern
   Europe being three, and in northern Europe six. A total of 20 willow
   species were recorded, along with 12 hybrids. The most widespread willow
   in the transect was Salix alba L. (occurring in 20 sites out of 42)
   followed by S. triandra L. (15 sites), S. caprea L., S. phylicifolia L.
   (14 sites) and S. myrsinifolia Salisb., Salix xfragilis L. (13 sites).
   Voucher specimens from this study are deposited in the herbaria of the
   Natural History Museum (BM) and the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (K). These
   samples provide a ``snapshot{''} of willow diversity along a latitudinal
   gradient and an indication of the geographically changing taxonomic
   diversity that is presented to willow-feeding herbivores across Europe.
   It is anticipated that further papers will examine the insect fauna
   collected from these sites as part of this study.}},

Abstract = {{The appropriate management of natural riparian zones can provide
   numerous ecosystem services within an agricultural landscape, including
   the enhancement of regional biodiversity. Management of riparian zones
   has featured in Irish agri-environment schemes. We investigated the
   biodiversity of riparian field margins which had been fenced to provide
   water quality and biodiversity benefits. Surveys of plants, carabid
   beetles and spiders were conducted in typical habitat types that occur
   in riparian zones (grassland, scrub and woodland) on intensively-managed
   grassland systems in the south-east of Ireland.
   Distinct assemblages of plants and spiders were identified in each
   habitat type, but this was not the case for carabids. There were higher
   abundances of carabids and spiders in grass dominated riparian margins,
   while scrub dominated margins provided the highest regional carabid
   species richness.
   Riparian zones in intensively farmed areas in this study had a low
   incidence of specialised fauna. Proportional abundances or frequencies
   of riparian or wetland species for the surveyed flora and fauna were low
   when compared to the national flora and fauna and other similar studies.
   Management prescriptions in addition to those currently employed, such
   as limited grazing of fenced watercourse zones, may increase the
   abundance and/or species richness of some taxonomic groups. These
   results highlight the need for more appropriate management prescriptions
   and targeting of management actions if agri-environment measures aim to
   conserve farmland biodiversity in riparian zones.}},

Journal = {{CYBERGEO-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{The Crau Plain, a dried paleo delta of the Durance river, is a steppe
   grazed by sheep since over 4000 years, which has allowed the formation
   of a unique ecosystem. Since the construction of irrigation channels in
   the late sixteenth century, a part of the plain was transformed into hay
   meadows which produce highly nutritious fodder. It allowed the
   establishment of a ``Pastoral system - Foin de Crau{''} and the creation
   of a connection between this irrigated part and the steppe; secondly, it
   enabled the formation of abundant groundwater which is necessary to 270
   000 people and local economic activities. Since the early twentieth
   century, the plain has seen the intensification of artificial surfaces
   to the detriment of the steppe but also of irrigated areas at the
   benefit of urbanization and economic activities (military,
   transportation, logistics platform, garbage, market gardening,
   arboriculture...). The main activities and traditional functions of the
   plain, which are related to each other, change quickly in a context of
   strong pressure on the territory: (1) the surface used for the regular
   flooding of the hay meadows has shrinked, even though the flood supplies
   a large groundwater in which 80 million cubic meters of water are
   withdrawn each year; (2) similarly, the pastoralism reserved area for
   seasonal sheep grazing that allows to maintain a unique biodiversity in
   the arid steppe has dwindled. These rapid changes in land use now
   question both the sustainability of the aquifer which provides many
   ecosystem advantages to people and the upkeep, and even the
   reconstruction, of a unique biophysical environment of major ecological
   interest.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance and soil fertility are some of the main drivers influencing
   the dynamics of herbaceous communities. Such communities are among the

   up to evaluate the effects of compost and mowing on the dynamics of

   spontaneously growing in the nearby rural areas. Both soil properties
   (organic carbon, total nitrogen content, bulk density and pH) and plant
   species characteristics (density, biomass, height, functional traits)
   were determined. Our results showed that the addition of compost
   countered the soil compaction process with a positive effect on soil
   bulk density. Irrespective of compost and mowing, the amount of carbon
   and nitrogen in the soil was greatly influenced by the vegetation. Early
   season mowing increased the Shannon index and decreased the Simpson
   index, while over the years, with the increase in productivity,
   biodiversity decreased. Compost and mowing had a species-specific effect

Abstract = {{Butterflies belong to one of the most intensively studied invertebrate
   groups. However, detailed information on the larval ecology is still
   lacking in many species. This is especially true for the grass-feeding
   subfamily Satyrinae, to which our study species, the Woodland Ringlet
   (Erebia medusa Fabricius, 1787), belongs. At the habitat level, E.
   medusa exhibits a clear preference for abandoned grasslands with litter
   accumulation. In this study, we assessed the host-plant and oviposition
   preferences of E. medusa at the microhabitat level, i.e., within
   occupied habitat patches, in the Diemel Valley (Central Germany). Only
   two species of grass, Festuca ovina agg. and F. rubra agg., were
   systematically used for oviposition. Egg density was positively
   correlated with patchiness of herb layer, potential daily length of
   sunshine, and abandonment. However, the explanatory power of these
   parameters was low. We attribute this primarily to an ample supply of
   host plants growing under suitable conditions in the occupied habitat
   patches of E. medusa. The positive effect of abandonment is probably due
   to the fact that the average height of oviposition sites of E. medusa is
   greater than in most other satyrine species, which renders the eggs more
   vulnerable to mechanical disturbance. Moreover, thick layers of litter,
   which develop after the cessation of grazing or mowing, might be
   important as they modify the microclimate at the locations of the
   immature stages.}},

Abstract = {{The rich species pool in semi-natural grasslands is associated with high

   larger time-scale, grasslands managed by mowing once every year, and
   especially by a combined regime of mowing and grazing, supported the
   highest species richness of butterflies and beetles. Most functional
   diversity measures reached maximum values soon after mowing. Both strips
   of grass and belts of trees substantially affected the invertebrate
   community structure as the majority of taxa were positively associated

Abstract = {{Ecosystem services are typically valued for their immediate material or
   cultural benefits to human wellbeing, supported by regulating and

   and novel shocks, `climate adaptation services', are defined as the
   benefits to people from increased social ability to respond to change,
   provided by the capability of ecosystems to moderate and adapt to
   climate change and variability. They broaden the ecosystem services
   framework to assist decision makers in planning for an uncertain future
   with new choices and options. We present a generic framework for
   operationalising the adaptation services concept. Four steps guide the
   identification of intrinsic ecological mechanisms that facilitate the
   maintenance and emergence of ecosystem services during periods of
   change, and so materialise as adaptation services. We applied this
   framework for four contrasted Australian ecosystems. Comparative
   analyses enabled by the operational framework suggest that adaptation
   services that emerge during trajectories of ecological change are
   supported by common mechanisms: vegetation structural diversity, the
   role of keystone species or functional groups, response diversity and
   landscape connectivity, which underpin the persistence of function and
   the reassembly of ecological communities under severe climate change and
