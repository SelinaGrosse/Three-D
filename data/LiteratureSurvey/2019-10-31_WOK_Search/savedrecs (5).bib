Abstract = {{Species-rich native grasslands are frequently converted to species-poor
   exotic grasslands or pastures; however, the consequences of these
   changes for ecosystem functioning remain unclear. Cattle grazing
   (ungrazed or intensely grazed once), plant species origin (native or
   exotic), and species richness (4-species mixture or monoculture)
   treatments were fully crossed and randomly assigned to plots of
   grassland plants. We tested whether (1) native and exotic plots
   exhibited different responses to grazing for six ecosystem functions
   (i.e., aboveground productivity, light interception, fine root biomass,
   tracer nitrogen uptake, biomass consumption, and aboveground biomass
   recovery), and (2) biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationships
   depended on grazing or species origin. We found that native and exotic
   species exhibited different responses to grazing for three of the
   ecosystem functions we considered. Intense grazing decreased fine root
   biomass by 53\% in exotic plots, but had no effect on fine root biomass
   in native plots. The proportion of standing biomass consumed by cattle
   was 16\% less in exotic than in native grazed plots. Aboveground biomass
   recovery was 30\% less in native than in exotic plots. Intense grazing
   decreased aboveground productivity by 25\%, light interception by 14\%,
   and tracer nitrogen uptake by 54\%, and these effects were similar in
   native and exotic plots. Increasing species richness from one to four
   species increased aboveground productivity by 42\%, and light
   interception by 44\%, in both ungrazed and intensely grazed native
   plots. In contrast, increasing species richness did not influence
   biomass production or resource uptake in ungrazed or intensely grazed
   exotic plots. These results suggest that converting native grasslands to
   exotic grasslands or pastures changes ecosystem structure and processes,
   and the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification, including changes in cutting, grazing and
   fertilizer regimes, has led to declines in UK and NW European grassland
   biodiversity. We aimed to develop field margin management practices that
   would support invertebrate diversity and abundance on intensively
   managed grassland farms, focusing on planthoppers and leafhoppers
   (Auchenorrhyncha). Replicated across four farms in south-west England,
   we manipulated conventional management practices (inorganic fertilizer,
   cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to create seven
   treatments along a gradient of decreasing management intensity and
   increasing sward architectural complexity. Auchenorrhyncha were sampled
   annually between 2003 and 2005. Auchenorrhyncha abundance and species
   richness was highest in the most extensively managed treatments.
   Abundance was lowest with frequent cutting, while species richness was
   lowest where cattle grazing occurred. Unexpectedly, application of
   inorganic fertilizer had no effect on Auchenorrhyncha abundance or
   species richness. Management options that enhance invertebrate
   diversity, while allowing the remainder of the field to be managed
   conventionally, represent a potentially important conservation tool for
   many lowland improved grasslands. Extensification of conventional
   management in field margin areas of such grasslands are likely to
   benefit this numerically dominant component of grassland invertebrate
   fauna. These management practices have the potential to be incorporated
   into existing UK and European agri-environment schemes. (C) 2011

   diversity in highly fragmented landscapes}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2011}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The grasslands of central North America have experienced drastic
   reductions in extent, removal of historic disturbance patterns, and
   homogenization of remaining fragments. This has resulted in steep
   declines for a broad swath of grassland biodiversity. Recent work in
   relatively extensive grasslands has demonstrated that mimicking historic
   disturbance patterns using a fire-grazing interaction can increase the
   abundance and diversity of grassland birds through increased habitat
   heterogeneity. We examined the efficacy of this management strategy for
   promoting avian diversity in highly fragmented landscapes, which
   represent the bulk of remaining grassland bird habitats in the tallgrass
   prairie region. We quantified the population density of obligate and
   facultative grassland bird species along transects in 13 experimental
   research pastures in the Grand River Grasslands of Iowa and Missouri
   (USA), divided among three treatments: 1) spatially discrete fires and
   free access by cattle ({''}patch-burn grazed''), 2) free access by
   cattle and a single complete burn ({''}grazed-and-burned''), and 3) a
   single complete burn with no cattle ({''}burned-only''). We expected
   that patch-burn grazing would produce a bird community that overlapped
   that of the grazed-and-burned and burned-only treatments, because it
   would provide habitat for species associated with both. However, an
   analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) showed that community structure on
   pastures managed using patch-burn grazing instead diverged significantly
   from both of the other treatments. Differences in community structure
   were most highly correlated with visual obstruction and wooded edge
   density in the landscape, suggesting bird communities are differentiated
   not only by their structural habitat requirements, but also by the
   varying degrees of sensitivity to landscape fragmentation of their
   component species. The future success of this management scheme for
   fragmented grasslands hinges on if, after an optimal stocking rate is
   identified, adequate habitat can be maintained for a diverse bird
   community, or whether fragmentation will perpetually limit the efficacy
   of this method in these landscapes.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{80}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Polyphagous predatory invertebrates play a key role in the top-down
   control of insect herbivores. However, predicting predation risk for
   herbivores is not a simple function of predator species richness.
   Predation risk may be reduced or enhanced depending on the functional
   characteristics predator species. We predict that where predator species
   spatially overlap this will reduce predation risk for herbivores by
   allowing negative inter-specific interaction between predators to occur.
   Where increased predation risk occurs, we also predict that this will
   have a cascading effect through the food chain reducing plant growth.
   2. We used a substitutive replicated block design to identify the effect
   of similarity and dissimilarity in predator hunting mode (e.g. `sit and
   wait', `sit and pursue', and `active') and habitat domain (e.g. canopy
   or ground) on the top-down control of planthoppers in grasslands.
   Predators included within the mesocosms were randomly selected from a
   pool of 17 local species.
   3. Predation risk was reduced where predators shared the same habitat
   domain, independent of whether they shared hunting modes. Where
   predators shared the same habitat domains, there was some evidence that
   this had a cascading negative effect on the re-growth of grass biomass.
   Where predator habitat domains did not overlap, there were substitutable
   effects on predation risk to planthoppers. Predation risk for
   planthoppers was affected by taxonomic identity of predator species,
   i.e. whether they were beetles, spiders or true bugs.
   4. Our results indicated that in multi-predator systems, the risk of
   predation is typically reduced. Consideration of functional
   characteristics of individual species, in particular aspects of habitat
   domain and hunting mode, are crucial in predicting the effects of
   multi-predator systems on the top-down control of herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{1. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the stability of ecosystem
   processes is not governed by diversity per se, but by multitrophic
   interactions in complex communities. However, experimental evidence
   supporting this assumption is scarce.
   2. We investigated the impact of plant diversity and the presence of
   above- and below-ground invertebrates on the stability of plant
   community productivity in space and time, as well as the
   interrelationship between both stability measures in experimental
   grassland communities.
   3. We sampled above-ground plant biomass on subplots with manipulated
   above- and below-ground invertebrate densities of a grassland
   biodiversity experiment (Jena Experiment) 1, 4 and 6 years after the
   establishment of the treatments to investigate temporal stability.
   Moreover, we harvested spatial replicates at the last sampling date to
   explore spatial stability.
   4. The coefficient of variation of spatial and temporal replicates
   served as a proxy for ecosystem stability. Both spatial and temporal
   stability increased to a similar extent with plant diversity. Moreover,
   there was a positive correlation between spatial and temporal stability,
   and elevated plant density might be a crucial factor governing the
   stability of diverse plant communities.
   5. Above-ground insects generally increased temporal stability, whereas
   impacts of both earth., worms and above-ground insects insects depended
   on plant species richness and the presence of grasses. These results
   suggest that inconsistent results of previous studies on the
   diversity-stability relationship have in part been due to neglecting
   higher trophic-level interactions governing ecosystem stability.
   6. Changes in plant species diversity in one trophic level are thus
   unlikely to mirror changes in multitrophic interrelationships. Our
   results suggest that both above- and below-ground invertebrates decouple
   the relationship between spatial and temporal stability of plant
   community productivity by differently affecting the homogenizing
   mechanisms of plants in diverse plant communities.
   7. Synthesis. Species extinctions and accompanying changes in
   multitrophic interactions are likely to result not only in alterations
   in the magnitude of ecosystem functions but also in its variability
   complicating the assessment and prediction of consequences of current
   biodiversity loss.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing demand for the sustainable management of
   old-field communities in northern China, which have developed on
   abandoned cropland on formerly converted natural steppe sites, to regain
   forage yield, biodiversity, and soil fertility. In thus study we
   examined how two management options-clipping and nitrogen (N)
   addition-may affect net >microbial N mineralization
   (ammonification+nitrification), microbial biomass carbon (MBC),
   microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), and microbial respirations (MR) in
   grass dominated, herb dominated, and grass-herb mixed patches in an
   old-field community in northern China. Topsoil (0-10 cm) net N
   mineralization rate was 177\% and 69\% higher in mixed grass and herb
   patches (patch B) as compared to unmixed grass (patch A) or herb (patch
   C) patches, respectively. Topsoil MBN was significantly different among
   the three patches with the highest value for soils taken from umixed
   grass patches. However, patches with mixed grass and herb or herb
   dominated patches had 12\% higher microbial respiration (MR) than
   unmixed grass patch. Clipping and N addition had no effects on net N
   mineralization or MBC, but both treatments decreased MBN and MR and
   increased the ratio between microbial biomass C and microbial biomass N
   (MBC/MBN) in the growing season. Incubation of soil cores under optimal
   water and temperature conditions in the laboratory showed that the
   response of microbial N transformations in soils under different
   vegetation patches to experimental N addition and clipping was limited
   by soil water availability. Our results strongly highlight the need to
   further study the importance of belowground C supply as a control of
   microbial N cycling processes. It also suggests that during the
   restoration process of degenerated croplands N cycling rates are
   stimulated, but that the magnitude of this stimulation is modulated by
   plant community composition of the old-fields.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of herbivores on species richness is important for the

   findings on this are far from consistent. The main objective of this
   study is to analyze how the cessation of grazing by goats affects the

   was conducted in the Teno Rural Park in the northwest corner of
   Tenerife, Canary Islands. The studied areas have been grazed by

   by local farmers, mainly for extensive goat production. In these areas
   we selected four blocks and in each block four 100 m(2) plots were

   exclosures) and two control plots. The analyses showed an accumulation

   plots at small scales. Power function parameters such as c and z only
   showed differences in function for the sampling year and not for the
   treatment. Although the results showed an increase in species richness

Abstract = {{With the increase in urban development, forest fragments are becoming
   more prevalent. In urban areas, there is a tendency to hide power-lines
   within or on the edges of these fragmented forests; however, it is
   unknown how the maintenance of vegetation under and along power-lines
   impacts the forest composition and structure of an adjacent fragmented,
   urban forest. An urban, fragmented maple-oak-hickory forest is located
   on the Meredith College campus, Raleigh, NC. A 1-ha plot with a hundred
   10- x 10-m subplots was established in 2007 to initiate a long-term
   project supporting undergraduate research. An adjacent meadow is cut and
   maintained regularly up to the forest and plot edge for power-line
   clearance and access. We identified, tagged, and measured all of the
   trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) >= 5 cm in this permanent
   plot, and compared the tree species richness (S), Shannon-Weiner
   diversity index (H), Sorenson's similarity index (Ss), DBH, stem
   density, and basal area along the 100-m gradient from the forest edge.
   We also used a non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analysis to
   describe how species composition changed along the gradient. Our
   findings showed that S, H, and Ss did not change along the 100-m
   gradient. The NMS confirmed that species composition was not different
   in the edge subplots (0-10 m from edge) compared to all other subplots
   and therefore was not impacted by continual, local disturbance along
   forest edges. However, we found that forest structure changed along the
   gradient with the exception of mean DBH; stem density and total basal
   area varied along the 100-m gradient. There was greater stem density
   along the edge of the forest (0-5 m and 10-20 m from edge) compared to
   the other interior subplots. Some of the interior subplots (10-20 m and
   60-70 m from the edge) had a higher total basal area than the remaining
   plots. As expected, we also found that there was a negative linear
   relationship between DBH and stem density for all subplots. Our results
   confirm trends found in previous studies that community structure
   parameters (stand density and basal area) differ between forest edges
   and their respective forest interiors, but did not agree with previous
   research, which found species composition to be affected by edges. We
   believe the regular pruning of the forest edge adjacent to the
   power-lines explains our observed differences in forest structure, but
   tree species richness, diversity, similarity, and composition may be
   determined by the disturbance of larger-scale ecological processes. Our
   results show how power-line placement within a fragmented urban forest
   can affect the structure of the adjacent forest, and we recommend that
   the ecological effects of power-line corridors should be further
   investigated and incorporated into the larger body of literature on
   forest fragmentation.}},

Abstract = {{Goat grazing management is a powerful ecological force structuring plant
   communities which effects are highly different depending on factors such
   as climatic conditions, grazing intensity, type of plant community, etc.
   Pastures in the Canary Islands have important heritage, socioeconomic
   and landscape values because they are the remains of traditional
   livestock management and a key element of local economy. An experimental
   study of goat grazing exclusion has been carried out in an area of La
   Gomera Island to determine the main effects of grazing abandonment on
   species richness and species composition. The species composition of La
   Gomera pastures is more sensitive to grazing than to climatic
   variability, though effects in the species richness in relation to
   grazing were not detected. Because the pasture origin in this area
   involved artificial, removing of non useful plants in order to provide
   land for agriculture more than 300 years ago, and using it for pastures
   around 80 years ago, the sustainable use has maintained this rich plant
   community. Grazing abandonment can have a negative effect on the
   pastures' diversity, as grazing has been a strong force in the
   maintenance of certain species. Public promotion of this primary
   activity is suggested to allow the continuation with minimal effects on
   the vegetation composition. This will help to conserve the high
   diversity of this area and the promotion of natural values as well as

Abstract = {{Several studies have proven the importance of field margins in
   sustaining biodiversity and other work has been done on the effect of
   field management on field margin flora. However few models have been
   built to predict the effects of field management on the flora. Our
   project addresses this need for a model capable of predicting the effect
   of cropping techniques and their timing on the flora of field margins.
   Primula vulgaris is a biodiversity indicator, characteristic of
   undisturbed flora and found in field margins and woodlands: its
   population has been declining for several years. We created a temporal
   matrix model of P. vulgaris populations on field margins, taking into
   account the effects of field, field margin and roadside management based
   on literature and expert knowledge. We then analysed its sensitivity to
   demographic parameters by comparing lambda (growth rate) sensitivity and
   elasticity. We compared the management parameter effect using the
   relative growth rate of the population after 6 years of simulation.
   Sensitivity analysis to biological parameters showed the importance of
   adult survival and seed production and germination. Results show that P.
   vulgaris is particularly sensitive to broad-spectrum herbicides and that
   other management techniques like early mowing, scything and scrub-killer
   (diluted broad-spectrum herbicide or specific herbicide) are less
   aggressive. Our simulations show that management of cash crops in
   Brittany is too aggressive for P. vulgar-is populations and that 4-5
   years of grassland in the adjacent field are necessary to maintain
   populations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the fact that the establishment and maintenance of blue gum
   plantations can potentially result in the removal of riparian
   vegetation, the presence of increased levels of sediments, pesticides,
   and nutrients, and consequently, the loss of in-stream biodiversity, few
   studies exist that have looked at the impacts of timber plantations on
   in-stream biota. The goals of this study were thus to determine water
   quality, riparian condition, and in-stream biodiversity values of local
   streams draining blue gum plantations in the Marbellup Brook catchment
   in Western Australia and to compare these values with those of streams
   associated with other land uses. Selected water quality and habitat
   variables and in-stream macroinvertebrate biodiversity were measured in
   2006 and 2007 at 28 sites falling into five broad categories based on
   the predominant land use within 200 m of each study reach. Overall, the
   results indicated that ``blue gum plantation{''} sites often had better
   water quality, riparian condition, and biodiversity values than
   ``pasture unfenced.{''} and sometimes ``pasture fenced{''} sites, but
   water quality and biodiversity values at these sites were not as good as
   those associated with ``remnant{''} native vegetation sites. The
   location of the blue gum plantation sites along the disturbance gradient
   investigated was attributed to both present management and past land
   uses in the subcatchments investigated. As this study was conducted at a
   time when blue gum plantations were in an on-growing phase, it was
   recommended that future research on the impact of blue gum plantations
   on waterways in southwestern Australia should include an investigation
   of the impacts of timber clear-cutting and extraction. Longer-term
   cumulative and downstream effects of blue gum plantations on local
   waterways also need to be investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Studies examining the interacting effects of ungulate herbivore pressure
   and site productivity on vegetation are mostly on grassland-grazing
   systems and have shown conflicting patterns. Here we examine the effects
   of deer density (>30 years differences in density between two
   landowners), site productivity (site index, SI) and stand age on
   subcanopy vegetation characteristics in 60 closed canopy, clear-cut
   origin Populus tremuloides dominated stands, Michigan, USA. Stand age
   effects were included because age varied among stands and can affect
   subcanopy vegetation patterns. Compared with fewer deer, stands with
   more deer had greater total forest floor vegetation mass, and its major
   components bracken fern (Pteridium aquilinum), sedge (mostly Carex
   pensylvanica) and trees/shrubs <0.25 m tall, but lower forb mass and
   lower forest floor vegetation species richness and diversity. Deer
   density and SI had strong interacting effects on total forest floor
   mass, forb mass, and species richness. Forb mass increased with SI, but
   only in stands with fewer deer, whilst total vegetation mass was greater
   in stands with more deer at lower SI and declined with SI more sharply
   than for stands with fewer deer. Species richness increased with SI but
   more so at lower than higher deer density. Deer density and age had
   interacting effects on mass of trees/shrubs <0.25 m tall and sedge.
   Compared with fewer deer, stands with more deer had greater sedge and
   tree/shrub mass, and sedge mass decreased and tree/shrub mass increased
   more sharply with age. In lower deer stands there was a dense subcanopy
   tree and shrub strata within and beyond the reach of deer 0.9-10 m tall
   whereas in higher deer stands this vegetation layer was nearly absent.
   We conclude that higher deer browse pressure in early successional
   Populus stands (1) strongly limits the recruitment of woody stems to
   larger (>0.9 m tall) size classes, which could affect long-term
   successional trajectories, and (2) diminishes forb density and species
   richness, especially at higher site productivity, but increases total
   forest floor vegetation mass (mostly bracken fern and sedge), especially
   at lower site productivity. Given associations of bracken fern and sedge
   with poorer and/or more open sites and assuming high palatability of
   forbs, this pattern may result from the combination of selective
   herbivory and higher light availability caused by limited recruitment of
   trees and shrubs to taller strata. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Plantations of native timber species established on former pasture are a
   potential strategy to reduce the logging pressure on remnant natural
   forests in the tropics. Such plantations may help to mitigate or reverse
   the negative impacts of land degradation, and they may contribute to the
   long-term livelihood of livestock farmers. Planting native trees is,
   however, perceived as a risky activity due to limited knowledge of their
   performance and due to marked losses of newly established seedlings
   attributed to insect pests. Our study focuses on the small-scale effects
   of environmental heterogeneity, tree diversity and insecticide treatment
   on the performance of three native Central American timber species two
   years after establishment, and on damage inflicted by insect herbivores.
   Growth, survival and herbivore leaf damage were quantified for
   Anacardium excelsum (Anacardiaceae). Cedrela odorata (Meliaceae) and
   Tabebuia rosea (Bignoniaceae) planted in an experiment in Panama as (1)
   monocultures, (2) mixed stands, and (3) mixed stands protected by
   insecticides. Our study revealed that small-scale effects can have a
   substantial impact on the success of timber trees planted on former
   pasture. Growth performance and survival of the three species was
   strongly affected by small-scale environmental heterogeneity, which was
   expressed as significant differences in growth and survival among
   different plantation plots at the same study site. Establishment of
   trees in mixed stands did not have significant effects on tree survival
   and growth compared to pure stands, although it reduced herbivore
   pressure in one of the studied tree species. All tree species grew best
   and suffered lowest leaf damage when protected by insecticides,
   indicating a general influence of insect herbivory on growth of newly
   established trees. In contrast to growth performance, survival was not
   significantly affected by different management practices or herbivory.
   The large variability among plots in tree survival and growth, and also
   in the effects of management practices such as planting design and
   insecticide treatment, emphasizes the importance of small-scale
   environmental heterogeneity on tree survival and growth. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The disappearance of low-intensity types of agricultural land use such
   as mowing and grazing is a global phenomenon which leads to changes in
   species composition and interactions in plant communities. In central
   Germany, formerly species-rich, semi-natural dry grasslands have been
   converted into species-poor communities dominated by Festuca rupicola or
   Poa angustifolia. As a consequence, several forbs have become
   endangered, and biodiversity has decreased. In a 5-year competition
   experiment (replacement design; pots were placed outdoors at Halle
   Botanical Garden), we evaluated the performance of plant-plant
   interactions between the rare forb Campanula glomerata, F. rupicola and
   P. angustifolia, respectively. The response of C. glomerata to the
   presence of the two grass species were measured by stem length, number
   of flowers and above-ground biomass annually harvested. We did not find
   significant differences in C. glomerata stem lengths between years and
   treatments, but flower production, which was highest in the first year,
   strongly decreased in the subsequent years. Moreover, flower production
   was lower in combination with P. angustifolia than with F. rupicola.
   Biomass production showed significant differences between years, but not
   between treatments. The positive and negative interactions between C.
   glomerata and the two grass species was estimated by calculating
   Relative Neighbour Effect Index (RNE). In combination with F. rupicola,
   interactions switched between facilitation and competition from year to
   year. In the presence of P. angustifolia, competitive effects on C.
   glomerata were highest in the second year, but declined from year to
   year. Curiously, there were no significant correlations between positive
   and negative interactions with climatic conditions (annual temperature,
   precipitation and relative air humidity). Our results showed that the
   response of the rare forb C. glomerata varies with neighbour species,
   and that fecundity is more prominently affected by competition than stem
   height or biomass. Our data indicate that biomass removal by traditional
   land use methods would facilitate the restoration of species-rich dry
   grassland communities.}},

Abstract = {{Question
   Which environmental and historical variables affect epiphytic lichen
   diversity in managed and unmanaged wooded meadows?
   Location
   The island of Gotland located in the Baltic Sea east of the Swedish
   mainland.
   Methods
   We examined total epiphytic lichen diversity (crustose, foliose and
   fruticose species) on 1148 trees in eight grazed, eight traditionally
   managed (mowing, hay gathering and pollarding) and seven unmanaged
   wooded meadows. In addition to management, data on site location,
   habitat structure, history and adjacent habitat were analysed.
   Results
   Lichen species richness increased with wooded meadow area and was
   greater within managed sites than in unmanaged meadows. Historic crown
   cover (ca. 1930) also influenced present-day lichen richness. Geographic
   location, distance to sea, wooded meadow area and average tree
   circumference were important determinants of lichen species composition.
   Tree circumference was the strongest overall predictor of the number of
   species on individual trees. However, tree circumference interacted with
   management regime, whereby cessation of management appeared to reduce
   species richness most on large trees. Traditionally managed sites, on
   average, supported the greatest richness of red-listed species.
   Conclusions
   Management regime, wooded meadow area and canopy cover were the main
   drivers of lichen species richness, while geographic location, wooded
   meadow area, distance to sea and average tree circumference were
   important determinants of species composition.}},

Abstract = {{Human land use, through forest management and conversion of natural
   habitats into agroecosystems, has often resulted in loss of
   biodiversity. Spiders are important predators in terrestrial ecosystems,
   biological control agents against pests in agroecosystems and forests,
   and useful indicators due to their sensibility to changes in habitat
   structure and microclimate. Effects of land use on spiders have been
   reviewed several times but existing reviews are narrative and usually
   focused on one single kind of management. We summarize the impacts of
   land use on spider abundance and species richness using meta-analysis.
   The main ecosystems where the effect of management on spiders has been
   studied were forests, agroecosystems and rangelands (including meadows
   and grasslands). Although our survey retrieved studies from all parts of
   the world and climatic zones, a dominance of studies from temperate
   habitats in Europe and North America was evident. The meta-analysis
   showed negative effects on spider species richness and abundance for
   agroecosystems and rangelands, but were less evident for forests. From
   10 kinds of land management identified, all but forest plantation showed
   effects on spider richness or abundance. These land management scenarios
   affected either species richness (forest fragmentation and logging,
   farmland abandonment, and miscellaneous management including plowing,
   cutting and fire), or spider abundance (forest fragmentation, forest
   fire, conventional farming, insecticides, grazing, and farmland
   abandonment), but not both. Edge effects had contrasting effects
   depending on the ecosystem, affecting spider species richness in
   agroecosystems and abundance in rangelands and forests. Direct
   destruction of spiders or negative effects on habitat heterogeneity or
   prey populations were the most likely causes of the negative effects
   detected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Livestock grazing is an important form of land use across the globe
   and changes in grazing pressure can have profound effects on vertebrate
   populations.
   2. In Scotland, over the last decade sheep numbers in many areas have
   declined from historically high levels, providing an opportunity to
   explore the implications of these declines for biodiversity.
   3. The hen harrier Circus cyaneus is a bird of high conservation
   importance in the UK, and a species that may be heavily influenced by
   the indirect effects of sheep on habitat and prey. The hen harrier
   population on the Orkney Islands in Scotland has been monitored since
   1975 and represents an ideal case study for considering the impact of
   sheep de-stocking on a key predator.
   4. Declines in the harrier population were associated with a doubling in
   sheep numbers between the early 1980s and the late 1990s. Subsequently,
   as sheep numbers have fallen the harrier population has recovered. These
   changes indicate an association but no clear mechanism, so we tested
   whether reductions in sheep numbers have led to increases in harrier
   prey or preferred foraging habitat. We then tested whether breeding
   output over the last 33 years correlates with sheep stocking levels or
   variation in weather conditions (rainfall and temperature).
   5. Orkney sheep numbers declined by about 20\% between 1998 and 2008.
   Surveys in 1999/2000 and repeated in 2008 showed increases in rough
   grassland, the preferred harrier foraging habitat, and increases in a
   key prey species, the Orkney vole Microtus arvalis orcadensis.
   6. Overall, hen harrier breeding output over the last 33 years was
   significantly negatively correlated to both sheep abundance and spring
   rainfall.
   7. Synthesis and application. This study provides strong evidence for
   the consequences of changes in sheep numbers on a top predator. Our
   results indicate that reductions in sheep numbers are likely to prove
   beneficial for some upland species, particularly small mammals and their
   predators.}},

Abstract = {{P>1 Spontaneous succession is often underappreciated in restoration
   after the cessation of intensive agricultural management. Spontaneous
   succession could improve the success of restoration programmes, and
   offers a cost-effective option with little active intervention.
   2 We studied the spontaneous recovery of loess grasslands in extensively
   managed lucerne Medicago sativa fields mown twice a year using space for
   time substitutions to highlight the importance of spontaneous processes
   in grassland restoration.
   3 With increasing field age a gradual replacement of lucerne by
   perennial native grasses and forbs and increase of mean species richness
   was detected. As the age of fields increased, lucerne decreased from
   75\% to 2\% of total vegetation cover, whereas perennial graminoids
   increased from 0 center dot 5 to 50\% cover. Mean total cover showed no
   significant differences between the age groups; weed cover was less than
   10\%.
   4 The phytomass of lucerne was negatively correlated with graminoid
   phytomass. As the age of the fields increased, lucerne phytomass
   decreased and grass phytomass increased. We found a negative correlation
   between litter and forb phytomass but there was no relationship with the
   age of the field. There was no litter accumulation and no increase of
   mean total phytomass as the age of fields increased.
   5 Synthesis and applications. Native grasses within loess grasslands
   recovered within 10 years, but characteristic native forbs remained
   rare. The advantages of spontaneous succession in lucerne fields
   compared to technical reclamation include: (i) no early stages dominated
   by weeds, (ii) minimal litter accumulation, (iii) a spontaneous decrease
   in lucerne over time, and (iv) negligible cost. In addition, the
   requirement for twice yearly mowing in the early years will guarantee
   farmer involvement because of the high forage value of lucerne. The
   complete restoration of species rich grasslands will require more active
   management such as propagule transfer by hay and/or moderate grazing to
   encourage the return of native forbs.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Does long-term grazing exclusion affect plant species
   diversity? And does this effect vary with long-term phytomass
   accumulation across a regional productivity gradient?
   Location: Lowland grassy ecosystems across the state of Victoria,
   southeast Australia.
   Methods: Floristic surveys and phytomass sampling were conducted across
   a broad-scale productivity gradient in grazing exclusion plots and
   adjacent grazed areas. Differences in species richness, evenness and
   life-form evenness between grazed and ungrazed areas were analysed. The
   environmental drivers of long-term phytomass accumulation were assessed
   using multiple linear regression analysis.
   Results: Species richness declined in the absence of grazing only at the
   high productivity sites (i.e. when phytomass accumulation was > 500 g
   m(-2)). Species evenness and life-form evenness also showed a negative
   relationship with increasing phytomass accumulation. Phytomass
   accumulation was positively associated with both soil nitrogen and
   rainfall, and negatively associated with tree cover.
   Conclusions: Competitive dominance is a key factor regulating plant
   diversity in productive grassy ecosystems, but canopy disturbance is not
   likely to be necessary to maintain diversity in less productive systems.
   The results support the predictions of models of the effects of grazing
   on plant diversity, such as the dynamic equilibrium model, whereby the
   effects of herbivory are context-dependent and vary according to
   gradients of rainfall, soil fertility and tree cover.}},

Abstract = {{The intensive discussion on the importance of biodiversity for the
   stability of essential processes in ecosystems has prompted a multitude
   of studies since the middle of the last century. Nevertheless, research
   has been extremely biased by focusing on the producer level, while
   studies on the impacts of decomposer diversity on the stability of
   ecosystem functions are lacking. Here, we investigate the impacts of
   decomposer diversity on the stability (reliability) of three important
   aboveground and belowground ecosystem functions: primary productivity
   (shoot and root biomass), litter decomposition, and herbivore
   infestation. For this, we analyzed the results of three laboratory
   experiments manipulating decomposer diversity (1-3 species) in
   comparison to decomposer-free treatments in terms of variability of the
   measured variables. Decomposer diversity often significantly but
   inconsistently affected the stability of all aboveground and belowground
   ecosystem functions investigated in the present study. While primary
   productivity was mainly destabilized, litter decomposition and aphid
   infestation were essentially stabilized by increasing decomposer
   diversity. However, impacts of decomposer diversity varied between plant
   community and fertility treatments. There was no general effect of the
   presence of decomposers on stability and no trend toward weaker effects
   in fertilized communities and legume communities. This indicates that
   impacts of decomposers are based on more than effects on nutrient
   availability. Although inconsistent impacts complicate the estimation of
   consequences of belowground diversity loss, underpinning mechanisms of
   the observed patterns are discussed. Impacts of decomposer diversity on
   the stability of essential ecosystem functions differed between plant
   communities of varying composition and fertility, implicating that
   human-induced changes of biodiversity and land-use management might have
   unpredictable effects on the processes mankind relies on. This study
   therefore points to the necessity of also considering soil feedback
   mechanisms in order to gain a comprehensive and holistic understanding
   of the impacts of current global change phenomena on the stability of
   essential ecosystem functions.}},

Title = {{Plant Diversity Surpasses Plant Functional Groups and Plant Productivity
   as Driver of Soil Biota in the Long Term}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: One of the most significant consequences of contemporary
   global change is the rapid decline of biodiversity in many ecosystems.
   Knowledge of the consequences of biodiversity loss in terrestrial
   ecosystems is largely restricted to single ecosystem functions. Impacts
   of key plant functional groups on soil biota are considered to be more
   important than those of plant diversity; however, current knowledge
   mainly relies on short-term experiments.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We studied changes in the impacts of
   plant diversity and presence of key functional groups on soil biota by
   investigating the performance of soil microorganisms and soil fauna two,
   four and six years after the establishment of model grasslands. The
   results indicate that temporal changes of plant community effects depend
   on the trophic affiliation of soil animals: plant diversity effects on
   decomposers only occurred after six years, changed little in herbivores,
   but occurred in predators after two years. The results suggest that
   plant diversity, in terms of species and functional group richness, is
   the most important plant community property affecting soil biota,
   exceeding the relevance of plant above-and belowground productivity and
   the presence of key plant functional groups, i.e. grasses and legumes,
   with the relevance of the latter decreasing in time.
   Conclusions/Significance: Plant diversity effects on biota are not only
   due to the presence of key plant functional groups or plant productivity
   highlighting the importance of diverse and high-quality plant derived
   resources, and supporting the validity of the singular hypothesis for
   soil biota. Our results demonstrate that in the long term plant
   diversity essentially drives the performance of soil biota questioning
   the paradigm that belowground communities are not affected by plant
   diversity and reinforcing the importance of biodiversity for ecosystem
   functioning.}},

Title = {{Assessing long-term land-use legacies in subalpine grasslands by using a
   plant trait-based generic modelling framework}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY \& DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4, SI}},
Pages = {{391-402}},
Abstract = {{Background: In European mountains, where semi-natural grasslands have
   high cultural and nature conservation value, land-use legacies from past
   ploughing are associated with distinct floristic compositions and
   ecosystem properties. It remains unknown if these differences are stable
   or if post-arable grasslands are only transient states that eventually
   follow a predictable successional pathway.
   Aims: We use a generic vegetation dynamics model based on plant traits
   to test these alternative hypotheses in subalpine grasslands of the
   central French Alps.
   Methods: We classified dominant graminoids into trait-based Plant
   Functional Types (PFTs) and simulated their long-term response to
   fertility, annual mowing and past ploughing.
   Results: Simulations demonstrated that a temporary dispersal limitation
   of long-lived tussock grasses could have allowed species-rich hay
   meadows to develop as alternative communities. We also show that when
   they are regularly mown, meadows are resistant to colonisation by
   long-lived tussock grasses.
   Conclusions: Our results thus support traditional management based on
   regular mowing, but also highlight the key role of landscape history
   through its effects on dispersal. Our study also demonstrates the
   usefulness of easy-to-measure plant traits and a widely applicable
   generic modelling framework for testing hypotheses on the long-term
   interactions of multiple drivers of vegetation dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Investigations were carried out in wet and dry pasture. Coenological
   recordings were taken in three zones. The first zone ({''}A{''}) located
   0-50 m near the stable, second zone ({''}B{''}) located 50-150 m from
   the stable, while the third zone ({''}C{''}) located farther than 150 m.
   We have carried out analyses of ecological and environmental factors and
   life form types. Based on our results for both dry and wet grasslands,
   quadrates of ``A{''} zone were well isolated from the rest of the zones.
   Overgrazing, which involves considerable trampling, vanishes differences
   among vegetations, thereby promotes weed and disturbance tolerant rich
   vegetation. The lowest species number and diversity could be found here.
   Due to the nitrogen enrichment due to the constant presence of
   livestock, drier and less heat demanding habitat developed in the
   ``A{''} zones, according to the environmental indicators. Because of the
   change in management, conservation and diversity values of ``C{''} zone
   increased, however, according to nature protection values it
   underperformed compared to ``B{''} zone. According to the sample area,
   wet grasslands from the sandy areas of Kiskunsag, preserve nature
   protection values and grass composition better moving away from stables,
   due to less grazing pressure. Drier backgrounds tolerate stronger
   grazing pressure.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the relative importance of a variety of climatic and habitat
   variables in structuring ant communities along a 300-km climatic
   gradient. Sampling was conducted in semiarid, transitional and cool
   temperate climatic zones in New South wales, Australia. Ants were
   sampled at three paired sites of two habitats (pastures and conservation
   `remnants') in each of the climatic zones (herein referred to as
   `zones') using pitfall traps. Remnants represented original open
   forests, while pastures were a mix of grassland vegetation and cleared
   woodland. We tested the effects of habitat type, region (representing
   different climatic zones) and environmental variables on assemblages
   using distance-based similarity measures (PERMANOVA and PERMDISP) and
   canonical analysis of principal coordinates. Assemblage composition
   differed between habitats and zones, but we found no interaction
   effects. Assemblage dispersion (between-site heterogeneity) differed
   between habitats but not among zones. Pasture habitats supported more
   homogeneous assemblages than remnant habitats. Our findings suggest that
   habitat type, and structure, homogenise assemblages in pastures, thus
   overriding the effects of local climate apparent in remnants. As
   remnants are isolated within the biologically homogeneous pastures,
   movement of unique species between remnants in response to climate
   changes may be limited, thus landscape connectivity is likely to be
   important in reducing species loss.}},

Abstract = {{Deforestation and conversion of native habitats to exotic pasture and
   crops, plus inefficient agricultural and cattle management practices,
   are placing great pressures on natural resources in the Pantanal and
   Cerrado. To prevent further deforestation and protect biodiversity,
   areas already developed for farming and ranching need to be managed more
   efficiently and profitably, so that economic incentives for additional
   deforestation are minimized. To that end, the Wildlife Conservation
   Society (WCS) has been working with rural community partners to promote
   best-management practices that optimize profitability and efficient use
   of developed lands, while minimizing pressures on natural resources. To
   improve pasture conditions and reduce cattle impacts, we evaluated the
   use of rotational grazing as a management tool by monitoring native
   pasture and cattle within continuous and rotational grazing areas on a
   southern Pantanal ranch. Monthly comparisons of the grazing systems
   showed that forage dry mass in the rotational area was greater compared
   to that of continuously grazed areas. After 17 months, mean cattle
   weights were 15\% heavier and pregnancy rates 22\% higher for the herd
   using the rotational system. Based on forage allowance estimates, the
   potential stocking rates of the rotational system were 2 to 6 times
   higher than rates typical of continuously grazed areas in the Pantanal.
   Results support the use of rotational grazing in native pasture areas of

Abstract = {{Regeneration of seminatural grasslands are often threatened by the

   experiment designed to suppress the spread of C. epigejos in
   mid-successional grasslands in Hungary. The experimental design
   consisted of 16 permanent plots of 363 m. Half of the plots were mowed
   twice a year (in June and September), the other half was left as
   control. Vegetation was sampled in 262 m quadrates before mowing in each
   year between 2001 and 2009. The effects of mowing were tested using
   repeated-measure analyses of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey HSD for post hoc
   tests. Significant decrease of C. epigejos appeared after 2 years of
   mowing. Species richness increased after 4 years, while diversity after
   8 years. By this time the target native species Brachypodium pinnatum
   become dominant. Similar trends appeared in the control plots during
   spontaneous succession but at much slower rates. Our results suggest
   that C. epigejos disappears spontaneously in secondary grassland
   succession after ca. 40-50 years. However, mowing twice a year can speed
   up this process by opening a ``colonization window{''} to the valuable
   target species. For successful control, mowing should be maintained for
   approximately 8 years.}},

   Shrub land specialists were positively affected by shrub cover and

Abstract = {{In sandy grassland vegetation of Central Europe, extensive grazing is
   often a management tool to maintain and improve nature conservation
   value. As part of a long-term field experiment lasting 10 years we
   investigated the effects of sheep grazing as a type of moderate
   disturbance. As ``experiments by nature{''} happened in this time period
   we were also able to study severe biotic (rabbit grazing) and abiotic
   (drought) disturbances, examining the recovery and resilience of the
   system after these severe disturbances.
   Within a six-fold replicated randomised split-plot design, 25-m(2) plots
   of Armerio-Festucetum trachyphyllae vegetation were studied from 2000 to
   2009 in the northern upper Rhine valley (Germany). We analysed
   sheep-grazed and non-grazed plots (both with very low rabbit impact
   until the first half of 2005). In 2005 we established an additional plot
   type without rabbit and sheep grazing. Severe rabbit impact was studied
   in detail from 2006 to 2008 concerning flower resources, seed
   production, endozoochorous seed dispersal and phytomass extraction. Data
   were analysed by ordination methods and mixed linear models.
   In times of low rabbit densities moderate disturbance by sheep grazing
   maintained species diversity. Severe drought in 2003 resulted in a
   marked decrease of species numbers, but the system recovered already in
   2004. The subsequently analysed ``high rabbit impact{''} resulted in
   decreases of species numbers, cover of bryophytes, flower quantities and
   seed content in faeces. Species numbers also declined on plots without
   rabbit grazing, but for different reasons. Shifts in phenological phases
   due to rabbit grazing were not observed, but the sum of flowers and
   number of flowering species decreased. After the decline of the rabbit
   population, species numbers slightly increased in 2009. Non-grazed plots
   showed an increase of litter.
   Despite severe disturbances by rabbits or drought, the community

Abstract = {{Over the last 20 years, a change in traditional land use practices has
   taken place in central Germany. Formerly species-rich dry grassland
   communities have been converted into communities with greatly reduced
   diversity in many places. Whereas grass species have expanded, several
   forbs have declined in abundance. For the present study, plant-plant
   interactions were assessed between the expanding grass Festuca rupicola
   and the forb Dianthus carthusianorum - two typical, companion grassland
   species - to ascertain any associated effects of land use change. A
   competition experiment was set up with replacement design, in which pots
   were placed in the open field and monitored over two consecutive years.
   In order to assess the performance of both species in monoculture (D9,
   F9) and mixture (D3F6, D6F3) the parameters biomass, length of flowering
   stems, number of flowering stems and number of flowers per individual,
   or length of panicles, were analyzed. Positive and negative interactions
   were evaluated using the ``Relative Neighbour Effect{''} index (RNE). To
   simulate land use by grazing or mowing, individuals in half of the pots
   were clipped in the first year after sowing. At this time, performance
   of D. carthusianorum - in terms of length of flowering stems, number of
   flowering stems and number of flowers - was significantly affected:
   whereas the first parameter increased, both of the other parameters
   decreased with increasing presence of the grass species. However, RNE
   indicated facilitation with a low number of F. rupicola individuals, and
   competition with a high number of F. rupicola individuals. In contrast,
   F. rupicola did not show any significant differences in performance with
   increasing presence of D. carthusianorum, and the RNE switched from
   neutral interaction to facilitation. In the second year after sowing,
   the performance of D. carthusianorum in the various treatments did not
   differ, except for the length of the flowering stems. The simulation of
   land use practices did not affect the performance of D. carthusianorum,
   but F. rupicola showed significant differences in biomass and in length
   of the panicles, as was the case also between monocultures and mixtures.
   The performance of the grass species was clearly improved in the
   unclipped treatments. The RNE reflected competition against D.
   carthusianorum which became reduced in unclipped treatments, while F.
   rupicola became facilitated. There were no interactions between the
   different treatments (monocultures and mixtures) and the simulated land
   use change (clipped and unclipped). Our data suggest that although
   traditional land use practices, i.e. grazing and mowing, do not affect
   the development of D. carthusianorum, the abandonment of these practices
   has improved F. rupicola performance, which has led to the increasingly
   invasive character of this grass species over the last 20 years. (C)

Volume = {{108}},

Abstract = {{The creation of improved areas is one way of increasing the productivity
   of livestock on Cantabrian heathland (NW Spain), a habitat that is
   frequently located in less favourable mountainous areas where the
   development of sustainable husbandry is limited. The effect of this on
   the biodiversity of heathland is unclear and likely to depend on several
   factors, such as the grazing regime. In order to clarify this situation,
   the effects of type of vegetation, species of grazer and grazing regime
   on the composition of the ground-dwelling arthropod fauna of partially
   improved heathland were determined. The effects of grazing by cattle or
   sheep and two grazing regimes (cattle or sheep, or both of them together
   with goats) were studied in eight plots (two replicates per treatment).
   Each plot included two types of vegetation, gorse (Ulex
   gallii)-dominated shrubland and improved grassland (Lolium
   perenne-Trifolium repens). Arthropods were surveyed using pitfall traps.
   Overall, the composition of the arthropod fauna did not differ between
   plots grazed by different species of grazer or using different grazing
   regimes but was significantly associated with the type of vegetation.
   Most of the opilionids and several carabids clearly preferred shrubland,
   while lycosids and various carabids were mainly associated with
   grassland. While the species of grazer affected the faunal composition
   of grassland, grazing regime was more important in shrubland. Arthropod
   responses to the grazing treatments were determined by the grazing
   behaviour of the large herbivores and the habitat requirements of each
   arthropod taxon. The great structural heterogeneity of the vegetation
   and the more micro-habitats in shrubland grazed by mixed flocks was
   mainly a result of the goats preferring to browse on the woody
   vegetation in these areas. The grazing by either sheep or cattle had
   less of an affect on the fauna of shrubland than grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims Re-introduction of large grazers in the few
   remaining natural and semi-natural grasslands are thought to be an
   effective management tool to prevent dominance of late successional
   plant species and restoration of plant biodiversity. The main objective
   of this study was to test whether the introduction of large herbivores
   retard the succession by reducing the abundance of highly competitive
   tall species and whether it is accompanied with changes in plant
   community composition and spatial distribution of plant species.
   Methods In order to test this hypothesis, we studied the effect of
   grazing by large herbivores on vegetation at three hierarchical levels:
   individual plant species, emergent groups of functionally similar
   herbaceous plant species, and the main gradients of plant community
   composition. Study sites were thirteen spatially separated, dry coastal
   dune grasslands in western Belgium and north-western France.
   Key results Grazing had a predominantly negative effect on high
   competitive dominant species and led to changes in composition of
   emergent groups toward less competitive plant species. Additionally,
   these changes in plant community composition were accompanied with
   changes in spatial distribution patterns of individual plant species and
   community richness.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that the current grazing management
   applied in these nature reserves is able to prevent the expansion of
   dominant highly competitive species and establishment of functionally
   different plant species.}},

Volume = {{165}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Bison (Bos bison) were a keystone species in the tallgrass prairie
   region of the Great Plains of North America. Cattle (Bos taurus) have
   been described as a functional equivalent to bison and have replaced
   bison in most of the grassland that remains intact. However, non-grazing
   behaviors influence grassland dynamics and are dissimilar between bison
   and cattle. Wallowing behavior (a non-grazing behavior by bison, but not
   cattle) creates disturbances (wallows) that were a common feature (may
   have numbered more than 100 million) of tallgrass prairie prior to
   extirpation of bison and conversion of most land to row-crop
   agriculture. We hypothesized that wallows are a unique disturbance that
   significantly influence both the structure and function of tallgrass
   prairie. We examined the response of plants to wallowing disturbances on
   Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas, where a herd of approximately
   200 bison had year-round access to 1000 ha of native tallgrass prairie.
   We determined the influence of this disturbance type on aboveground net
   primary production (ANPP), plant species richness and diversity, and
   plant life form richness and diversity. The ANPP at the edge of
   wallowing disturbances was double the production in wallows and in
   adjacent prairie, which were not different from year to year. Plant
   species richness and diversity were significantly lower in wallows than
   at the edge of wallows and in adjacent prairie during all years of the
   study. However, composition of species were dissimilar among locations
   (e.g., 16\% of all plant species samples were found only in the
   wallows); and, therefore, wallows increased the local and likely
   regional diversity of plant species. Likewise, wallowing disturbances
   increased local richness and diversity of plant life forms. It appears
   that these once common wallowing disturbances increase the diversity of
   tallgrass prairie beyond that of prairie that is grazed only (i.e.,
   prairie with cattle).}},

Abstract = {{A multi-factorial experiment was carried out in the alpine zone of the

   following treatments were applied in exclosures and grazed plots: (i)
   artificial microsite creation; (ii) addition of seeds; (iii) a
   combination of microsites + seed addition. 1-m(2) permanent plots were
   marked in fenced exclosures and grazed areas of a Nardus
   stricta-grassland and two fen sites at 2300 m a.s.l. The three sites
   were selected along a soil moisture gradient from dry to wet conditions.
   The number and species of seedlings, percent cover of vegetation and
   percent cover of litter in the 1-m2 plots were recorded. Total seedling
   number increased significantly after seed addition in the fen sites
   suggesting that seed limitation occurred. In the Nardus
   stricta-grassland, however, seed addition was not effective probably due
   to competition by the highly dominant Nardus stricta-tussocks and dry
   soil conditions. Microsite creation significantly affected seedling
   recruitment in the fen; in the Nardus stricta-grassland the disturbance
   did not significantly affect seedling establishment. Grazing exclusion
   exerted significant effects on seedling flora composition in the Nardus
   stricta-grassland, but in the fen, no such effects were detected. This
   may be ascribed to the longer time of exclusion in the Nardus
   stricta-grassland (six years) compared to the fen (one year). Total
   cover of vegetation and litter cover had negative effects on seedling
   recruitment except for a fen site with temporarily surface water where
   positive interactions resulted. Thus the role of vegetation and litter
   cover can be regarded as site-specific, depending on soil moisture and

Abstract = {{Wetlands are ecologically and economically important ecosystems with

   determined by abiotic factors, grazing disturbance may also be an
   important influence on this community. We evaluated the effects of
   livestock grazing on wetland vegetation in marsh and wet meadow zones in
   intermountain depressional wetlands in the southern interior of British
   Columbia, Canada. We sampled marshes and wet meadows in 36 wetlands
   along a grazing intensity gradient ranging from fully fenced and
   ungrazed wetlands to unfenced wetlands heavily grazed by livestock. The
   amount of bare ground was used as a surrogate measure of the intensity
   of livestock grazing. Vegetation community structure and composition was
   strongly associated with grazing intensity. Increased livestock grazing
   favored shorter-lived and smaller plants: conversely, the frequency of
   tall and rhizomatous species, which constitute the dominant plant
   species in these systems, declined with higher livestock use. The
   effects of grazing were more pronounced in the marsh than in the wet
   meadow. Associations between species richness and grazing differed
   between zones: native and exotic species richness showed a unimodal
   response in the marsh while in the wet meadow exotic richness increased
   and native richness showed no response. The relationship between exotic
   frequency and grazing was also inconsistent between zones, with a
   negative association in the marsh and a positive but weak association in

   conditions in a dry tropical peri-urban region in India. From four study
   sites that covered contrasting land uses: abandoned brick kiln (ABK),
   grazing land (GL), Kali river bank (KRB), and agricultural land (AL), a
   total of 360 monoliths were randomly extracted in three seasons, and dry
   weights were estimated for aboveground and belowground parts of species

Abstract = {{Natasa Pipenbaher, Mitja Kaligaric \& Sonja Skornik: Floristic and
   Functional comparision of karst pastures and karst meadows from the
   North Adriatic Karst
   In the present study, we compared the species richness and the floristic
   and functional composition of two types of extensively managed, species
   rich dry grasslands (class Festuco-Brometea) from the North Adriatic
   Karst: karst pastures (alliance Satureion subspicatae) and karst meadows
   (alliance Scorzonerion villose). Karst pastures are characterized by
   shallow rocky soils, high pH, and dry, warm conditions, whereas karst
   meadows have developed on deeper soil, with more humus and moisture and
   neutral to alkaline pH. The data set included a table with 100
   phytosociological releves of the studied grasslands and a matrix with 15
   functional traits determined for 180 plant species. We found high
   species richness in these grasslands but no statistically significant
   differences in species richness between karst pastures and meadows.
   Differences in floristic composition were analysed with Detrended
   Correspondence Analysis, which supported a clear division between the
   two vegetation types and indicated that species composition could best
   be explained in terms of soil humidity and nutrient availability. We
   also detected several differences in plant functional traits between
   meadows and pastures. Some of the traits indicate greater resource
   availability on karst meadows (in particular, high SLA, low LDMC). In
   contrast, karst pastures have more slow-growing species with a
   combination of traits that can be interpreted as an avoidance strategy
   in relation to disturbance (e.g., grazing) in low productive habitats
   (e.g., low SLA, high LDMC, early flowering species and plants with
   rosette). A lower relative proportion of competitors (C) and ruderals
   (R), and a higher relative proportion of stress-tolerators (S) in karst
   pastures also suggested that these grasslands generally experience
   higher intensities of stress when compared to karst meadows, presumably
   owing to lower resource availability on stony, shallow soil. We could
   conclude that karst meadows and pastures differ significantly in both
   floristic composition and functional trait means, owing to their
   distinctive land-use (disturbance) and environmental conditions.}},

   variety of true bugs was sampled by pitfall traps. Altogether 1396 adult
   individuals belonging to 49 species were collected. Some species
   occurred exclusively at forest habitats and significant indicator
   species were found in both forest and grassland habitats. However,
   distinct Heteroptera assemblages were found only at grasslands. The
   response of the grassland Heteroptera assemblages to the proximity of
   the edge differed between the two sites. At site one, an approximately
   seven-meter wide transition zone could be observed from the grassland
   into the forest, which was characterized by the dissolution of the
   grassland true bug assemblage. The species richness decreased
   significantly toward the edge. At site two, an abrupt change in the
   structure of the Heteroptera assemblage denoted a sharp boundary near to
   the edge in the juniper forest. The species richness did not changed
   toward the juniper edge. We found that the cover of dicotyledonous
   plants, mosses and lichens, bare soil surface and leaf litter had a
   significant joint effect on true bug assemblages. The characteristic
   species of the grasslands responded differently to the edges. Specialist
   herbivour bugs seemed to be affected more strongly and negatively by

   endangered Bloemfontein Dry Grassland at the Free State National
   Botanical Gardens between April 2009 and March 2010. Interaction
   strengths between plants and arthropods varied within a calendar year;
   being strongest in winter months (July and August), initiation of the
   growth season (November) and peak growth season (February and March). It
   was hypothesised that variation was caused by changing primary
   productivity. The trophic composition of the arthropod community
   supported this hypothesis as the ratio between primary consumers
   (herbivores) and secondary consumers (predators and parasitoids) showed
   patterns that coincided with periods of strong arthropod-plant
   interactions. Patterns were explained by multiple theories linking plant
   and arthropod diversity. It was concluded that arthropod assemblages are
   closely linked to primary producers, the abiotic environment and
   top-down trophic forces at different times of the year. Future
   arthropod-based studies should be performed with clear objectives and
   seasonal benchmark conditions to overcome these variations.}},

Abstract = {{Emerging ecological theory predicts that vegetation changes caused by
   introduction of livestock grazing may be irreversible after livestock
   are removed, especially in regions such as Australia that have a short
   evolutionary exposure to ungulate grazing. Despite this, fencing to
   exclude livestock grazing is the major tool used to restore vegetation
   in Australian agricultural landscapes. To characterise site-scale
   benefits and limitations of livestock exclusion for enhancing
   biodiversity in forb-rich York gum (Eucalyptus loxophleba Benth. subsp.
   loxophleba)-jam (Acacia acuminata Benth.) woodlands, we compared 29
   fenced woodlands with 29 adjacent grazed woodlands and 11 little-grazed
   `benchmark' woodlands in the Western Australian wheatbelt. We explored
   the following two hypotheses: (1) fencing to exclude livestock
   facilitates recovery of grazed woodlands towards benchmark conditions,
   and (2) without additional interventions after fencing, complete
   recovery of grazed woodlands to benchmark conditions is constrained by
   ecological or other limits. Our first hypothesis was supported for
   vegetation parameters, with fenced woodlands being more similar to
   benchmark woodlands in tree recruitment, exotic plant cover, native
   plant cover, native plant richness and plant species composition than
   were grazed woodlands. Further, exotic cover decreased and frequency of
   jam increased with time-since-fencing (2-22 years). However, we found no
   evidence that fencing led to decline in topsoil nutrient concentrations
   towards concentrations at benchmark sites. Our second hypothesis was
   also supported, with higher topsoil nutrient concentrations and exotic
   plant cover, and lower native plant richness in fenced than in benchmark
   woodlands, and different plant species composition between fenced and
   benchmark woodlands. Regression analyses suggested that recovery of
   native species richness is constrained by exotic species that persist
   after fencing, which in turn are more persistent at higher topsoil
   nutrient concentrations. We conclude that fencing to exclude livestock
   grazing can be valuable for biodiversity conservation. However,
   consistent with ecological theory, additional interventions are likely
   to be necessary to achieve some conservation goals or to promote
   recovery at nutrient-enriched sites.}},

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{125-133}},
Abstract = {{Wild boar rooting is considered one of the main large soil disturbances
   affecting the structure and composition of plant communities in alpine
   grasslands. While direct consequences on plant community have been
   widely studied, their effects on soil seed banks have received little
   attention although rooting is assumed to determine the successional
   processes and ultimately the ecological recovery of the communities. The
   aim of this study is to assess the effect of wild boar rooting on
   species and community soil seed banks. The rooting effect was studied in
   terms of seed abundance and diversity in the most disturbed plant
   communities by wild boar in Pyrenean alpine grasslands. Two hundred soil
   core samples were collected at two depths to account for (short/long
   term) persistent and transient seed banks within and outside wild boar
   rooting in those grasslands. The `seedling emergence method' was used to
   identify and quantify seeds from the germinable seed bank. The soil seed
   bank found within disturbances was smaller than expected. At the species
   level, the main type of seed bank represented in these grasslands was
   long-term persistent, comprising 75\% of the seeds found. Rooting turned
   long-term persistent seed bank into short-term persistent and transient,
   by exposing seeds from the deepest part of the soil to germination
   conditions at the surface of disturbed areas. At the community level we
   found that rooting homogenized soil seed banks by increasing seed
   abundance and species richness in species-poor communities, while
   decreasing seed species dominance in nitrophilous communities. These
   results suggest a deep alteration of the structure of seed banks by wild
   boar rooting, which in turn, may not represent a real chance for
   colonization from soil seed banks.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of data on the combined effects of livestock species and
   grazing intensity makes it difficult to propose recommendations for the
   management of biodiversity and production in grassland ecosystems. We
   therefore divided a fertile grassland into 12 plots that were grazed by
   either cattle at a high or a low stocking density or by sheep at the
   same low stocking density. Grazing management had an immediate and
   direct impact on sward structure. We infer that dominant forbs
   (Taraxacum officinale) and legumes (Trifolium repel's) were strongly
   disadvantaged by biomass accumulation in lightly grazed plots.
   Consequently, stocking density affected plant community composition
   right from the start of the second year of the survey. There was direct
   and indirect evidence that the selection made by sheep on forbs and
   legumes could be stronger than the selection made by cattle. The impact
   of this difference in selectivity took six years to manifest, when
   legume abundance became lowest and grass abundance peaked in
   sheep-grazed pastures. Conversely, neither species richness nor evenness
   of the plant community was modified over the first six years of the

Abstract = {{The relationship between resource availability and biodiversity of

   before and after the first mowing in relation to network specialisation,
   species richness and composition of flower visitors.
   We studied 40 meadows, simultaneously sampling one meadow of low

   a separate interaction network, comprising all flower visitors found
   during 6 h in an area of 1000 m(2).
   In total we recorded 105 plant species and 586 flower visitor species.
   Species composition of plants and flower visitors differed considerably
   between the two management regimes, with species overlaps of 43\% in
   plants and 42\% in flower visitors. Complementary specialisation of
   flower visitors differed between taxa: dipterans were significantly less
   specialised than beetles and butterflies, and bees had the highest
   degree of specialisation. Earlier in the season (before mowing), meadows
   of low-intensity land use were significantly richer in flowering plant,
   bee and butterfly species. They also showed more plant flower visitor
   interactions, greater flowering areas and higher individual numbers of
   butterflies than meadows of high-intensity land use. However, later in
   the season (after mowing) management types differed only in plant
   species richness, being higher on meadows of low-intensity land use.
   We conclude that variations in plant species composition resulting from
   differences in grassland management may alter plant flower visitor

   stronger effects on the diversity and species composition of specialised
   flower visitor groups than on little or unspecialised flower visitors.}},

   affected plant survival, growth and performance in terms of shoot

   competition for light and different levels of herbivory in mixtures as
   compared with monocultures. Effects of the original environment were
   smaller and less consistent, but indicated differential selection in
   monocultures vs. mixtures. The interaction between actual and original

   better demonstrate the selection of genotypes specifically adapted to

Abstract = {{The most common management practices in European grasslands are grazing

   the effect of land use on the population genetic structure in the common

   The breeding system of V chamaedrys turned out as self-incompatible and
   outcrossing. Its genetic diversity did not differ among land-use types.
   This may be attributed to large population sizes and the strong
   dispersal ability of the species, which maintains genetically diverse
   populations not prone to genetic drift. Genetic differentiation among
   populations was low (overall F(ST) = 0.075) but significant among the
   three regions. Land use had only weak effects on population
   differentiation in only one region. However, land use affected
   small-scale genetic structure suggesting that gene flow within plots was
   more restricted on meadows than on mown and unmown pastures. Our study
   shows that land use influences genetic structure mainly at the small

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{609-619}},
Abstract = {{The fine-scale spatial structure of plant communities is a key component
   for understanding the dynamics in vegetation following changes in land
   management but needs to be assessed at an appropriate scale. We studied
   the response of plant diversity and spatial variability of species and
   trait composition to grazing vs. non-grazing (>20 years) using different
   grain sizes of sampling in three subalpine plant communities. Species
   composition, diversity, and the aggregated values of 4 leaf traits were
   assessed at 7 grain sizes (within quadrats ranging from 25 cm(2) to 1
   m(2)) in 9 grazed and ungrazed paired plots. Evenness and species
   richness showed a strongly community-dependent response as they
   increased following grazing exclusion in the less productive community
   and decreased in the two more productive ones. Although species richness
   was influenced by grazing exclusion at grains larger than 625 cm(2),
   evenness was affected at the finest grain investigated (25 cm(2)). In
   contrast, spatial variability of species composition was similarly
   affected across the three plant communities and increased following
   grazing exclusion from the 100 cm(2)-grain size. Grazing led to a
   sharper decline of spatial variability with increasing quadrat size
   revealing that the grain of spatial heterogeneity was finer in grazed
   plots relative to that in ungrazed ones. The response of spatial
   variability of aggregated trait values was less consistent, possibly
   because of functional redundancy between species. However, grazing
   exclusion increased the spatial variability of the aggregated values of
   leaf dry matter content and leaf carbon and nitrogen content. We suggest
   that spatial variability of species composition could be useful for
   detecting within-community changes in response to grazing management as
   it was detectable using a very fine scale of sampling and responded
   similarly to grazing treatment in every community. Such spatial
   variability in species composition can induce spatial organization of
   plant traits that may be important for community functioning.}},

Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{703-712}},
Abstract = {{Interactions between aboveground vertebrate herbivores and subterranean
   yellow meadow ants (Lasius flavus) can drive plant community patterns in
   grassland ecosystems. Here, we study the relative importance of the
   presence of ants (L. flavus) and ant mounds under different simulated
   grazing regimes for biomass production and species composition in plant
   communities. We set up a greenhouse experiment using intact soil cores
   with their associated vegetation.
   We found that plant biomass production in the short term was affected by
   an interaction between simulated grazing (clipping) and ant mound
   presence. Clipping homogenized production on and off mounds, while in
   unclipped situations production was higher off than on mounds. During
   the experiment, these differences in unclipped situations disappeared,
   because production on unclipped mounds increased. Plant species richness
   was on average higher in clipped treatments and patterns did not change
   significantly over the experimental period. Plant community composition
   was mainly affected by clipping, which increased the cover of
   grazing-tolerant plant species. The actual presence of yellow meadow
   ants did not affect plant community composition and production.
   We conclude that the interaction between ant mounds and clipping
   determined plant community composition and biomass production, while the
   actual presence of ants themselves was not important. Moreover, clipping
   can overrule effects of ant mounds on biomass production. Only shortly
   after the cessation of clipping biomass production was affected by ant
   mound presence, suggesting that only under low intensity clipping ant
   mounds may become important determining plant production. Therefore,
   under low intensity grazing ant mounds may drive the formation of
   small-scale plant patches.}},

Abstract = {{Calcareous grasslands, most of which are man made and therefore depend
   on some kind of human interference for their maintenance, are among the
   most species-rich communities on Earth at a small scale. For many
   centuries, most of these grasslands have been used as extensive pasture.
   However, after 1900, and particularly from 1940 onwards, livestock
   grazing has declined throughout Europe leading to the abandonment of low
   intensity grasslands over large areas. To conserve the remaining
   grasslands or to restore recently abandoned grasslands, better insights
   about the effects of grassland management on above and belowground
   species diversity are needed. Here, we describe the results of an
   11-year experiment to investigate the role of grassland management
   (grazing, mowing and abandonment) in determining species composition and
   diversity both in the aboveground vegetation and the seed bank of a
   calcareous grassland in Belgium. Species diversity declined by about
   60\% 11 years after abandonment, from 29 species m(-2) to as few as 12
   species m(-2). Plots that were grazed remained constant in species
   richness, whereas mown sites lost about 20\% of their original species.
   Abandoned plots were largely dominated by a few grass species, in
   particular Festuca nibra. Concomitant with changes in the aboveground
   vegetation, both the number of species found in the seed bank and seed
   density (number of seeds m(-2)) had changed significantly 11 years after
   abandonment. Species diversity and seed density were significantly lower
   in abandoned plots than in grazed or mown plots. We conclude that
   abandonment of calcareous grasslands may lead to rapid decline of plant
   species diversity both in the aboveground vegetation and in the seed
   bank. As a result, seed banks probably have a limited role to play in
   the restoration of recently abandoned grasslands. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Capsule Population response of breeding waders to agri-environment
   management varied between management options and species; implementation
   has been on too small a scale to reverse national population declines.
   Aims To test whether numbers of five breeding wader species have shown a
   more positive response between 1992 and 2005, at sites with appropriate
   agri-environment management, than at sites that have remained outside
   such schemes.
   Methods Using data from 60 pairs of farmland study areas in Scotland
   first surveyed in 1992/93, before agri-environment scheme (AES)
   implementation, and again in 2005, after scheme implementation, we
   tested at both site and field scales whether changes in the abundance of
   five breeding wader species were associated with AES management options
   designed to benefit these species.
   Results Changes in breeding wader abundance were more positive on sites
   in AES, especially for Northern Lapwings Vanellus vanellus and Common
   Redshanks Tringa totanus, even though management had not been targetted
   specially at breeding waders on those sites. However, AES management was
   associated only with modest population increase for Common Redshanks,
   and a reduction in the magnitude of decline for Northern Lapwings. At
   the field scale, there was evidence for Northern Lapwings, Common
   Redshanks and Common Snipe Gallinago gallinago that options which
   limited grazing and other agricultural activity were associated with
   more positive outcomes than those which also manipulated water levels.
   Conclusions AES management for breeding waders slowed, and in some cases
   reversed, breeding wader decline at field and farm scales. These
   benefits were from options that limited grazing and agricultural
   operations during the breeding season, but not those that also aimed to
   raise water levels. A possible explanation is that when wetland options
   are applied to agriculturally marginal fields, grazing reduction or
   abandonment, and succession to rank vegetation cover then occur over the
   course of 5-year agreements, with detrimental effects for breeding
   waders. Verification arrangements need to be robust enough to guard
   against this. Levels of agri-environment provision in 2005 were too
   limited and too poorly targeted at remaining key areas for breeding
   waders to be able to halt or reverse national population declines.}},

Abstract = {{For many decades the semiarid Chaco ecosystems of Argentina have
   experienced anthropogenic disturbances, such as fire and cattle grazing,
   that have shaped the present-day vegetation in concert with climatic and
   edaphic conditions. For example, the dynamic relationship between
   grassland and woodland may be altered by the frequency and intensity of
   fire and cattle grazing. We analyzed woody vegetation among sectors of
   two ancient watercourses with similar geomorphological histories; one
   undisturbed for some time (Copo National Park) and the other with a long
   history of cattle grazing and fire (Copo Provincial Reserve). The
   undisturbed site had lower total species richness, diversity, basal
   area, density of both adults and seedlings, and cover of woody
   vegetation than the disturbed site, and doubled the number of branches
   per adult shrub or tree. Species composition of woody plants was notably
   different between the two sites. Considering the similar

Abstract = {{Clonal plant species dominate meadow vegetation where grazing can
   generate spatial heterogeneity at different scales and can select for
   species that express particular sets of clonal traits. This in situ
   study aimed to characterize fine-grained spatial patterns of defoliation
   (<1 m) induced by contrasting cattle grazing intensities and to link
   these spatial patterns with the abundance of species-specific clonal
   traits. Using correlogams and synthetic spatio-temporal indices, the
   heterogeneity of vegetation height and leaf damage was monitored along a
   cattle grazing gradient. Species were identified and their clonal traits
   retrieved from the database CLO-PLA3. Under moderate grazing,
   fine-grained spatial patterns of defoliation were not stable over time.
   Defoliation was heterogeneous during the first months of the grazing
   season and then became homogeneous. Intensive grazing generated
   homogeneous defoliation, regardless of the date. In the study meadow,
   grazing gave rise to communities containing a greater abundance of
   annual species. However, clonal traits assumed to enable clonal
   fragments to benefit from heterogeneity do not seem advantageous.
   Increasing grazing intensity promoted species with clonal traits
   expected to minimize costs associated with clonality (aboveground clonal
   growth forms, short-distance lateral spread, and (or) short-lived
   connections). Ungrazed conditions favoured species with clonal traits
   associated with a high competitive ability.}},

Abstract = {{P>Insect outbreaks in forest and agriculture monocultures led Charles
   Elton to propose, a half-century ago, that higher plant diversity

   hypothesis by studying arthropod community dynamics in a long-term
   experimental manipulation of grassland plant species diversity. Over the
   course of a decade, we found that higher plant diversity increased the
   stability (i.e. lowered year-to-year variability) of a diverse (> 700
   species) arthropod community across trophic levels. As the number of
   plant species increased, the stability of both herbivore and predator
   species richness and of total herbivore abundance increased. The
   underlying mechanisms driving these diversity-stability relationships
   were plant diversity, via effects on primary productivity and plant
   community stability, and portfolio effects. Taken together, our results
   show that higher plant diversity provides more temporally consistent
   food and habitat resources to arthropod foodwebs. Consequently, actively

Abstract = {{Seagrass beds have higher biomass, abundance, diversity and productivity
   of benthic organisms than unvegetated sediments. However, to date most
   studies have analysed only the macrofaunal component and ignored the
   abundant meiofauna present in seagrass meadows. This study was designed
   to test if meiobenthic communities, especially the free-living
   nematodes, differed between seagrass beds and unvegetated sediments.
   Sediment samples from beds of the eelgrass Zostera capricorni and nearby
   unvegetated sediments were collected in three estuaries along the coast
   of New South Wales, Australia. Results showed that sediments below the
   seagrass were finer, with a higher content of organic material and were
   less oxygenated than sediments without seagrass. Univariate measures of
   the fauna (i.e. abundance, diversity and taxa richness of total
   meiofauna and nematode assemblages) did not differ between vegetated and
   unvegetated sediments. However multivariate analysis of meiofaunal
   higher taxa showed significant differences between the two habitats,
   largely due to the presence and absence of certain taxa. Amphipods,
   tanaidacea, ostracods, hydrozoans and isopods occurred mainly in
   unvegetated sediments, while kinorhyncs, polychaetes, gastrotrichs and
   turbellarians were more abundant in vegetated sediments. Regarding the
   nematode assemblages, 32.4\% of the species were restricted to Z.
   capricorni and 25\% only occurred in unvegetated sediments, this
   suggests that each habitat is characterized by a particular suite of
   species. Epistrate feeding nematodes were more abundant in seagrass
   beds, and it is suggested that they graze on the microphytobenthos which
   accumulates underneath the seagrass. Most of the genera that
   characterized these estuarine unvegetated sediments are also commonly
   found on exposed sandy beaches. This may be explained by the fact that
   Australian estuaries have very little input of freshwater and experience
   marine conditions for most of the year. This study demonstrates that the
   seagrass and unvegetated sediments have discrete meiofaunal communities,
   with little overlap in species composition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Apart from forests, the landscape of the Alps is dominated by
   grasslands, where they account for up to 40\% of the agricultural area.
   This study focuses on the main man-made grassland plant communities of
   the Eastern Alps, shows their current spatial distribution and examines
   how strongly the influence of land use and site factors determines the
   communities. Discriminant analysis was used to harmonize the
   phytosociological classification of 1502 vegetation releves from the
   literature and 375 own recorded inventories from Western Austria and
   Northern Italy. Land-use intensity, altitude, slope and pH were also
   recorded, in order to assess the impact of the factors to plant
   communities, as calculated in nonmetric multidimensional scaling. We
   identified 39 plant communities and generated a table with the main
   ecological and floristic parameters as well as a map showing their
   present spatial distribution. Contrary to the literature, the pasture
   communities Crepido-Festucetum commutatae, Deschampsio cespitosae-Poetum
   alpinae and Rumicetum alpini occur also in fertilized meadows. On the
   other hand we found meadow communities occurring in pastures, such as
   the Angelico-Cirsietum oleracei, the Pastinaco-Arrhenatheretum, the
   Ranunculo repentis-Alopecuretum pratensis and the Trisetetum
   flavescentis. The most species-rich communities - the Caricetum
   ferruginei and the Seslerio-Caricetum sempervirentis occur in
   unfertilized meadows above calcareous bedrock. Further species-rich
   communities - the Campanulo scheuchzeri-Festucetum noricae, the
   Gentianello anisodontae-Festucetum variae, the Pulsatillo
   alpinae-Festucetum noricae, the Trifolio thallii-Festucetum nigricantis
   and the Hypochoerido uniflorae-Festucetum paniculatae - are endangered:
   they are regionally restricted and depend on the absence of fertilizer
   and on mowing once annually or every second or third year. Therefore
   agri-environmental measures should focus on unfertilized mountain
   meadows, in order to conserve these rare grassland communities. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to identify changes in the plant species
   richness, diversity and composition of a mountain hay meadow (alliance
   Polygono bistortae-Trisetion flavescentis) after abandonment in
   comparison with a control cut once per year. The experiment was carried
   out from 1999 to 2008 in a mountain hay meadow in the Bukovec nature
   reserve in the north-eastern part of the Jizera Mountains (Jizerske
   hory, Gory Izerskie, Isergebirge), Czech Republic.
   The number of vascular plants species with cover greater than or equal
   to 1\% remained almost the same throughout the study period: however,
   the total number of vascular plants was higher in the cut treatment
   after the first four years of the study. The cover of Festuca
   rubra,Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Briza media and
   Trifolium repens was positively affected by cutting. On the other hand,
   the cover of Cirsium heterophyllum, Geranium sylvaticum, Hypericum
   maculatum, Trisetum flavescens and Luzula luzuloides was higher on the
   abandoned treatment plots.
   The main effect of the abandonment on plant species composition was the
   shift in cover of the dominant species. Despite ten years of contrasting
   management, changes in the vegetation were relatively small with no
   shift to a different plant community. Therefore the cutting regime
   combined with several years of no management may be a suitable
   management strategy for the maintenance of Polygono-Trisetion grasslands

Abstract = {{Andean grasslands of the La Araucania Region are used every year by
   Pehuenches communities as forage resources for their livestock. Grazing
   is one of the most important disturbances which affect natural meadows

   plant composition. With the aim of determining the floristic composition
   of the Andean grasslands in the Alto Bio-Bio National Reserve (37
   degrees S y 70 degrees W) and its relationship with the cattle load, we
   studied five sites within the reserve: Cuchares Grande, Cajon Chileno,
   Tralilhue, Cuchares Chico and Mancha de Pinos. In each site, we sampled
   20 random plots recording all the species and their relative cover. We
   recorded a total of 89 species of vascular plants. Taxonomic richness is
   represented by two Pteridophyta and 87 Magnoliophyta species. In this
   last group, 25 species are Liliopsida and 62 are Magnoliopsida. All
   flora is distributed ill 37 families and 72 genera. Greatest families,
   in species number, are Asteraceae (13), Poaceae (11), Cyperaceae (6) and
   Rosaceae (6). About the origin, 88 species are native and only 11 are
   introduced, representing 88\% and 12\%, respectively. Life forms are
   represented mostly by hemicryptophytes with 53\%, then cryptophytes
   arround 17\% and finally chamaephytes (15\%). Grasslands wich have
   greater livestock density, have a higher proportion of introduced
   species and hemicryptophytes and a greater floristic similarity between
   them, while those with lower livestock densities have a higher native
   species proportion. These results suggest that cattle use could have a
   significant impact in the floristic composition of Andean grasslands.
   Even though, the low proportion of introduced species found, the high
   percentage of hemicryptophytes indicates an intermediate level of

Abstract = {{The Little Bustard has undergone a steep reduction of its Western
   Palaearctic range over the last century. In the west of France, breeding

   Little Bustard abundance and nest productivity have been monitored since
   1995 in a 450-km(2) site in western France. We assessed the proximate
   causes of the decline of Little Bustards in French farming landscapes
   and quantified the effectiveness of conservation measures that aimed to
   reverse the decline. The decline of Little Bustard, from about 65 males
   in 1995 to just six males in 2003, could be related to a near absence of
   recruitment over this period. Since 2004, the establishment of more than
   1300 ha of specifically targeted agri-environment schemes (AES) in the
   study site has led to a sharp increase in female productivity, mainly
   associated with nesting in AES fields. By imposing constraints on mowing
   dates, AES have prevented nest destruction and female mortality during
   mowing and, by increasing plant species diversity, provided chicks with
   a higher abundance of grasshoppers. This has contributed to reversing
   the trend, and increasing the population to around 30 males in 2009.
   Conservation strategies involving specifically targeted AES based on the
   identification of limiting factors can help to reverse the decline of

Abstract = {{Semiarid rangelands often respond slowly to rest/relaxation of grazing
   pressure by large herbivores, and the effects of grazing are most often
   inferred from this direction of study because the imposition of grazing
   onto previous ungrazed/lightly grazed areas occurred prior to the age of
   scientific studies. These rangelands host a diversity of small and large
   herbivores, but grazing studies most often concern effects of the large
   generalists. Here, the effects of herbivore body size on plant species
   richness and dominant species, and imposition and relaxation of grazing
   by large herbivores were studied by opening half of exclosures
   established in 1939 and building new exclosures to large herbivores, and
   to small-plus-large herbivores. Plant richness using sensitive
   species-area sampling was studied in a dry and a wet year, about 62
   years after initiating the long-term experiment and about 6-10 years
   after initiating the altered designs. Convergence of the newly opened to
   large herbivore grazing treatment to the long-term grazed treatment
   occurred within 10 years, but convergence of the newly excluded to large
   herbivore treatment to the long-term excluded treatment had only partly
   occurred. This indicated that recovery from grazing is slow relative to
   imposition of grazing by large herbivores, but effects of the additional
   exclusion of small-plus-large herbivores occurred relatively rapidly.
   These results were mirrored by trajectories of convergence of the
   dominant species, and this is discussed with respect to implications for
   state-and-transition models. Short-term exclusion of small-plus-large
   herbivores resulted in greater richness than even long-term exclusion of
   only large herbivores, even though quantities consumed by small
   herbivores are much less than by large. Grazing effects on plant
   richness were large in the wet year, but the very dry year suppressed
   richness on all treatments. When sampling effort and area are the same,
   the numbers and attributes of species unique to a treatment are
   indicators of rareness of the richness and traits selected for by the
   treatment. More unique species were sampled in the small-plus-large
   herbivore exclosures when comparing body size, and the long-term large
   herbivore exclosures when comparing time of exclosure. Unique species
   encountered during sampling the ungrazed treatments were generally
   forbs, exotic and/or weedy invasive species, and often tall, annual
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Regenerating sclerophyllous shrubby and woody vegetation on uncultivated
   land in the Mediterranean region is a source of browse for goats,

   shrubland was intensively grazed by mixed herds, predominantly goats
   that maintained an open landscape. In addition, the vegetation supplied
   timber for fuel and construction, as well as culinary and medicinal
   plants. Patches of deeper soil were cultivated, often on terraces. In
   recent years, goat husbandry has declined and the establishment of
   protected areas has favored the regeneration of a dense woodland
   dominated by Quercus calliprinos. Commercial beef husbandry has largely
   replaced the traditional management system. After initial thinning to
   open up the thickets, the oak woodland can sustain a viable beef herd
   with moderate supplementation. Appropriate management of grazing,
   control of the shrub component and, in some cases, soil nutrient
   amelioration, can lead to the development of relatively stable, open
   woodland with nutritious and usually attractive herbaceous patches. In
   addition to animal production, these rangelands have significant
   recreational, conservation, and landscape values that are becoming
   increasingly important as urbanization increases. Such landscapes
   provide a wide range of ecological services and are less of a fire
   hazard than the undisturbed regenerating successional shrub thickets.
   The multiple benefits of the open landscape can justify the expense of
   necessary interventions that cannot be borne by any single benefit.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the potential contribution of the persistent soil seed
   bank in post-disturbance restoration of the herb layer in a long-term
   overgrazed, mixed oak forest (NW Greece). We examined the impacts of
   grazing on plant richness and density in the soil seed bank in regard to
   the different dispersal and life strategy types of the herb layer taxa.
   Soil seed bank was qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed and
   contrasting plant guilds were defined according to life strategy type
   and dispersal mode. Soil seed bank differences between a) the upper and
   lower soil layers and b) plant functional guild pairs (ruderals vs. non
   ruderals, including typical forest taxa, and physically-vs.
   animal-dispersed plants) were statistically tested in overgrazed and
   sporadically grazed plots. Moreover, correlations in soil seed bank
   species dominance between overgrazed and sporadically grazed plots were
   examined by Spearman's Rank correlation. The majority of seeds were
   found in the upper (0-5 cm) soil layer. Seed density in the deeper (5-10
   cm) soil layer was rather poor and did not differ significantly between
   overgrazed and sporadically grazed plots. In the upper soil layer, both
   seed density and plant species richness were significantly lower in the
   overgrazed plots. Overgrazing reduced both species richness and seed
   density of non-ruderal species in general and typical forest herbs in
   particular, while it did not affect ruderal species richness and
   density. Plant species richness and seed density of animal-dispersed
   taxa were reduced by overgrazing while physically-dispersed species were
   not affected; it is therefore concluded that large herds of grazers
   fenced in relatively small areas cannot act as efficient dispersal
   vectors of the former species. Our findings suggest that, upon cessation
   of grazing, the soil seed bank is rather inadequate to restore the herb
   layer of overgrazed forest sites.}},

Title = {{Using plant functional traits to understand the landscape distribution
   of multiple ecosystem services}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Spatially explicit understanding of the delivery of multiple
   ecosystem services (ES) from global to local scales is currently
   limited. New studies analysing the simultaneous provision of multiple
   services at landscape scale should aid the understanding of multiple ES
   delivery and trade-offs to support policy, management and land planning.
   2. Here, we propose a new approach for the analysis, mapping and
   understanding of multiple ES delivery in landscapes. Spatially explicit
   single ES models based on plant traits and abiotic characteristics are
   combined to identify `hot' and `cold' spots of multiple ES delivery, and
   the land use and biotic determinants of such distributions. We
   demonstrate the value of this trait-based approach as compared to a pure
   land-use approach for a pastoral landscape from the central French Alps,
   and highlight how it improves understanding of ecological constraints
   to, and opportunities for, the delivery of multiple services.
   3. Vegetative height and leaf traits such as leaf dry matter content
   were response traits strongly influenced by land use and abiotic
   environment, with follow-on effects on several ecosystem properties, and
   could therefore be used as functional markers of ES.
   4. Patterns of association among ES were related to the dominant traits
   underlying different ecosystem properties. The functional decoupling
   between height and leaf traits provided alternative pathways for high
   agronomic value, as well as determining hot and cold spots of ES.
   Traditional land uses such as organic fertilization and mowing or
   altitude summer grazing were also linked with ES hot spots, because
   functional characteristics supporting fodder production and quality are
   compatible with species and functional diversity.
   5. Synthesis. Analyses of ES using plant functional variation across
   landscapes are a powerful approach to understanding the fundamental
   ecological mechanisms underlying ES provision, and trade-offs or
   synergies among services. Sustainable management of species and
   functionally diverse grassland could simultaneously aim at conserving
   biodiversity and locally important ES by taking advantage of
   correlations and trade-offs among different plant functional traits.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand how mammalian herbivory affects tallgrass prairie,
   I set up field exclosures to test effects of above-ground herbivory

   below-ground herbivory (BGH) (Geomys bursarius and Spermophilus
   tridecemlineatus are potential below-ground herbivores), and the
   interaction of the exclusion of both, on tallgrass prairie plant
   species, plant community parameters, and soil parameters in the Flint
   Hills of Northeastern Kansas. I found that (1) AGH reduced the cover of
   some forbs but increased the cover of others while both AGH and BGH
   decreased the cover of dominant C-4 grasses, (2) no treatments
   significantly affected species richness but ABH reduced total cover and
   maximum height of the vegetation while BGH reduced species evenness and
   maximum height, and (3) no treatments affected soil pH or soil nitrogen
   but BGH reduced soil organic matter, soil phosphorus, and soil
   potassium. Whereas above-ground mammalian herbivory has significant
   effects on individual plant populations and plant community structure,
   it is BGH that mainly affects soil parameters. Results suggest that for
   prairie patches where both kinds of herbivory are present, these effects
   may be additive leading to cumulative effects on tallgrass prairie
   plants both directly, through herbivory, and indirectly, through soil
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing is one of the most important factors influencing the

   showed the following: (i) the vegetation height, coverage, and
   above-ground biomass significantly declined with increased grazing
   intensity, but the species richness reached the highest level in a
   moderate grazing intensity meadow; (ii) grazing had a significant
   positive effect on soil properties in that the soil moisture content,
   soil organic carbon concentration, soil total nitrogen concentration,
   soil available nitrogen, soil total phosphorus, and soil available
   phosphorus significantly increased with increased grazing pressure; and
   (iii) soil C and N storage also significantly increased with increased

   results indicated that higher grazing intensity might have a potentially
   positive effect to increase the soil C and N storage in alpine meadows.

Abstract = {{Most studies of small mammal responses to habitat alterations focus on
   dominant species, with a resulting lack of information for rare species.
   jumping mice (Order Rodentia: Dipodidae) tend to be rare in small mammal
   trapping studies; thus, little is known of their response to habitat
   alterations, such as clear-cut logging. We examined the spatial
   distribution of meadow jumping mice (Zapus hudsonius) captured in 3
   upland habitat types (forest interior, forest edge, and logged forest)
   in the boreal forest of southeastern Yukon, Canada. Meadow jumping mice
   were the third most common rodent captured, and consistently constituted
   19.7\% of captures in all of the habitat types. Meadow jumping mice may
   not be rare in some boreal mammal assemblages. Significantly less
   animals were captured in the forest interior compared to the forest edge
   or logged forest (P < 0.05). A preference or avoidance of sharp habitat
   edges created by logging was not detected. Logged areas may be more
   preferred over unlogged areas by meadow jumping mice because they
   provide relatively diverse and abundant food resources and cover. To
   provide data more useful for biodiversity conservation, we suggest that
   studies of small mammals in forest ecosystems deploy a variety of trap
   types and sample at sufficient intensity to provide information on both
   dominant and rare species. (C) 2011 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur

Abstract = {{A number of factors have combined to diminish ecosystem integrity in New
   Zealand indigenous lowland forest fragments surrounded by intensively
   grazed pasture. Livestock grazing, mammalian pests, adventive weeds and
   altered nutrient input regimes are important drivers compounding the
   changes in fragment structure and function due to historical
   deforestation and fragmentation. We used qualitative systems modelling
   and empirical data from Beilschmiedia tawa dominated lowland forest
   fragments in the Waikato Region to explore the relevance of two common
   resilience paradigms engineering resilience and ecological resilience
   for addressing the conservation management of forest fragments into the
   future. Grazing by livestock and foraging/predation by introduced
   mammalian pests both have direct detrimental impacts on key structural
   and functional attributes of forest fragments. Release from these
   perturbations through fencing and pest control leads to partial or full
   recovery of some key indicators (i.e. increased indigenous plant
   regeneration and cover, increased invertebrate populations and litter
   mass, decreased soil fertility and increased nesting success) relative
   to levels seen in larger forest systems over a range of timescales.
   These changes indicate that forest fragments do show resilience
   consistent with adopting an engineering resilience paradigm for
   conservation management, in the landscape context studied. The relevance
   of the ecological resilience paradigm in these ecosystems is obscured by
   limited data. We characterise forest fragment dynamics in terms of
   changes in indigenous species occupancy and functional dominance, and

   vegetation in 6 different grazing lands including coastal pasture,
   reseeded pasture, artificial pasture, lowland shrubland, ungrazed
   pasture, and hillside shrubland. Forty-eight soil samples were taken by
   cores with a diameter and depth of 10 cm from each of grazing lands in
   August of 2007. A vegetation survey was conducted using a 0.5 x 0.5-m
   quadrant in both the spring and fall. Eighty species were observed in
   soil seed hanks and aboveground vegetation. The largest seed bank was
   observed in reseeded pasture (7,715 seed/m(2)), while the smallest seed
   bank was found in coastal pasture (2,755 seed/m(2)). Coastal pasture
   also possessed the least amount of aboveground vegetation (131
   plants/m(2). The most aboveground vegetation was found in ungrazed
   pasture (155 Plano/m(2)). The most common species in seed banks were
   annual and perennial grasses in reseeded pasture, annual forbs in
   artificial pasture and hillside shrubland, and perennial forbs in low
   shrubland and ungrazed pasture. Species richness, diversity, and
   uniformity in seed banks were highest in lowland shrubland and lowest in
   artificial pasture. The seed bank and aboveground vegetation were
   similar in ungrazed pasture, coastal pasture, reseeded pasture, low
   shrubland, hillside shrubland and artificial pasture. Shrublands play an
   important role in species richness and the number of germinated seeds

Abstract = {{The pastoral area of Romania, covering of over 4.8 million ha, has been
   influenced, over the last decades, by natural and human factors, which
   affect the normal functioning of the grassland ecosystem. The aim of
   this paper is to point out the dynamics of phytocoenotic biodiversity,
   as a result of applying grassland technical measures, in order to
   improve the yield and quality of grassland ecosystems with minimum
   effects on the environment. Therefore, the main aim of our study is to
   establish a positive relationship between biodiversity and the optimum
   quantity of organic fertilizers, which would improve the quality and
   quantity of the yield, without diminishing the floristic biodiversity.
   In the case of the studied grasslands, the phytocenotic biodiversity is
   influenced by the type of fertilization, the used rates and by the soil
   and climatic conditions. These grasslands may be improved by manure
   fertilization and reasonable usage, if proper management is applied. In
   Gradinari, Caras-Severin county, the dominant species are Festuca
   rupicala and Calamagrostis epigram, in Magurele. Brasov county, Agrostis
   Festuca pratensis, Poa pratensis and Trifolium repels, and in Pojorata,
   Suceava county, Agrostis Trisetum flavescens, Trifolium repens and

Abstract = {{The African elephant (Loxodonta africana) is a large-bodied, generalist
   herbivore that eats both browse and grass. The proportions of browse and
   grass consumed are largely expected to reflect the relative availability
   of these resources. We investigated variations in browse (C(3) biomass)
   and grass (C(4)) intake of the African elephant across seasons and
   habitats by stable carbon isotope analysis of elephant feces collected
   from Kruger National Park, South Africa. The results reflect a shift in
   diet from higher C(4) grass intake during wet season months to more C(3)
   browse-dominated diets in the dry season. Seasonal trends were
   correlated with changes in rainfall and with nitrogen (\%N) content of
   available grasses, supporting predictions that grass is favored when its
   availability and nutritional value increase. However, switches to dry
   season browsing were significantly smaller in woodland and grassland
   habitats where tree communities are dominated by mopane (Colophospermum
   mopane), suggesting that grasses were favored here even in the dry
   season. Regional differences in diet did not reflect differences in
   grass biomass, tree density, or canopy cover. There was a consistent
   relationship between \%C(4) intake and tree species diversity, implying
   that extensive browsing is avoided in habitats characterized by low tree
   species diversity and strong dominance patterns, i.e., mopane-dominated
   habitats. Although mopane is known to be a preferred species,
   maintaining dietary diversity appears to be a constraint to elephants,
   which they can overcome by supplementing their diets with less abundant
   resources (dry season grass). Such variations in feeding behavior likely
   influence the degree of impact on plant communities and can therefore
   provide key information for managing elephants over large, spatially
   diverse, areas.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding changes in biodiversity in agricultural landscapes in
   relation to land-use type and intensity is a major issue in current
   ecological research. In this context nutrient enrichment has been
   identified as a key mechanism inducing species loss in Central European
   grassland ecosystems. At the same time, insights into the linkage
   between agricultural land use and plant nutrient status are largely
   missing. So far, studies on the relationship between chemical
   composition of plant community biomass and biodiversity have mainly been
   restricted to wetlands and all these studies neglected the effects of
   land use. Therefore, we analyzed aboveground biomass of 145 grassland
   plots covering a gradient of land-use intensities in three regions
   across Germany. In particular, we explored relationships between
   vascular plant species richness and nutrient concentrations as well as
   fibre contents (neutral and acid detergent fibre and lignin) in the
   aboveground community biomass.
   We found the concentrations of several nutrients in the biomass to be
   closely linked to plant species richness and land use. Whereas
   phosphorus concentrations increased with land-use intensity and
   decreased with plant species richness, nitrogen and potassium
   concentrations showed less clear patterns. Fibre fractions were
   negatively related to nutrient concentrations in biomass, but hardly to
   land-use measures and species richness. Only high lignin contents were
   positively associated with species richness of grasslands. The N:P ratio
   was strongly positively related to species richness and even more so to
   the number of endangered plant species, indicating a higher persistence
   of endangered species under P (co-)limited conditions. Therefore, we
   stress the importance of low P supply for species-rich grasslands and
   suggest the N:P ratio in community biomass to be a useful proxy of the
   conservation value of agriculturally used grasslands. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{We report evidence of hierarchical resource selection by large
   herbivores and plant neighbouring effects in a Mediterranean ecosystem.
   Plant palatability was assessed according to herbivore foraging
   decisions. We hypothesize that under natural conditions large herbivores
   follow a hierarchical foraging pattern, starting at the landscape scale,
   and then selecting patches and individual plants. A between- and
   within-patch selection study was carried out in an area formed by
   scrubland and pasture patches, connected by habitat edges. With regard
   to between-patch selection, quality-dependent resource selection is
   reported: herbivores mainly consume pasture in spring and woody plants
   in winter. Within-patch selection was also observed in scrub habitats,
   influenced by season, relative patch palatability and edge effect. We
   defined a Proximity Index (PI) between palatable and unpalatable plants,
   which allowed verification of neighbouring effects. In spring, when the
   preferred food resource (i.e. herbs) is abundant, we observed that in
   habitat edges large herbivores basically select the relatively scarce
   palatable shrubs, whereas inside scrubland, unpalatable shrub
   consumption was related to increasing PI. In winter, a very different
   picture was observed; there was low consumption of palatable species
   surrounded by unpalatable species in habitat edges, where the latter
   were more abundant. These outcomes could be explained though different
   plant associations described in the literature. We conclude that optimal
   foraging theory provides a conceptual framework behind the observed
   interactions between plants and large herbivores in Mediterranean

   environmental factors explaining the compositional variation were
   related to the altitude, sheep grazing and soil depth. Pastureland
   abandonment led to an increase in vegetation height and of the richness
   of mesophytes and leafy plants, and red-list species. Grazed plots had
   higher total species richness, more xerophytes, rosette forming and

   second evaluated another seed mixture applied using three different
   seeding methods: (1) hand sown; (2) hydroseeding (high-pressure spray
   technique for applying a homogeneous slurry of seed and mulch); and (3)
   hydroseeding combined with transplantation of a single species extracted
   from the surrounding natural grassland. The success of revegetation
   treatments was analyzed in relation to vegetation cover, plant height
   and density, grass production, floristic composition, species richness
   and Shannon index. The results indicate that several techniques
   succeeded in establishing vegetation cover, but none were sufficient to
   achieve full restoration. Seeding treatments achieved high vegetation
   cover but did not result in the floristic composition of native
   grasslands. Plots with the transplantation of a native fescue displayed
   the highest proportion of native species.}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims - Livestock grazing exclusion was widely used to
   manage degraded grassland ecosystems, but little is known on the effects
   of long-term grazing exclusion on aboveground and belowground species
   diversity of the steppe vegetation in China.
   Material and methods - The species composition of the aboveground
   vegetation and the soil seed bank were examined on sites after a 25-year
   grazing exclusion in a typical steppe on the Loess Plateau, NW China.
   Key results - Results showed that long-term grazing exclusion
   significantly improved vegetation cover, biomass and aboveground species
   evenness. Long-term grazing exclusion significantly increased species
   richness and seed density in the soil seed bank, but significantly
   decreased belowground species evenness. The seeds were mainly present in
   the litter and the topsoil (0-5 cm), accounting for about 76\% of the
   total seed number.
   Exclusion of grazing significantly decreased seed depletion in soil seed
   bank from April to July as compared to grazed sites. The Sorensen
   similarity index between aboveground and belowground species composition
   was low in the typical steppe, and long-term grazing exclusion did not
   significantly improve this similarity.
   Conclusion - Our results suggest that long-term grazing exclusion can
   significantly improve both aboveground and belowground species diversity
   in the steppe vegetation of the Loess Plateau, but has little or no
   effect on the similarity in composition between the two compartments.}},

Abstract = {{The disturbances defined as an external factor causing biomass removal
   are a key component of all ecosystems. In phytocenoses with a continuous
   vegetation cover and a large proportion of perennial plants the
   fine-scale disturbances create gaps, which are the temporary
   competitor-free microsites suitable for plant recruitment. The
   investigations of natural colonization of different size gaps in
   Molinietum caeruleae meadows were carried out in patches dominated by
   small species creating delicate, erect or procumbent stems (MC),
   prevailed by large-tussock grasses (GR), and overgrown by willows (SA).
   Each patch was represented by ten plots, divided into four square
   subplots of 0.16 m(2), 0.09 m(2), 0.04 m(2) and 0.01 m(2). In each of
   them the above-ground parts of plants were clipped and removed with the
   litter. The seedlings recruitment was observed in 2007-2009.
   The highest species richness in gaps was observed in the MC patch and
   might be caused by week competition for light from neighbouring plants
   with delicate, procumbent stems and narrow leaves. The smaller rate of
   recruitment in SA and GR patches could be caused by overshading willows
   as well as by the competition from large and dense tussocks of
   Deschampsia caespitosa and Molinia caerulea. At all patches species
   richness declined with the decreasing gap size. The developed seedling
   pool represented both species occurring in the surrounding canopy and
   such which were not found there. However, their contribution varied
   between particular patches. Regardless gap size, the MC seedling pool
   was dominated by species which did not occur in the established
   vegetation, whereas in GR gaps both groups were represented by similar
   numbers of taxa and the SA gaps become dominated by species present in
   the surrounding canopy. Irrespective of patch character, in each subplot
   the medium-seeded species were represented most abundantly. The
   recruitment of genets of large-seeded species decreased, while the
   abundance of individuals of small-seeded taxa increased with the
   increasing gap size.
   In the light of the performed study, one might suggest that
   extent-controlled disturbances can be used as an effective way of the

Abstract = {{European semi-natural calcareous grasslands are species-rich ecosystems,
   considered as priority habitats by the European Union (92/43/EEC
   Directive) and judged worthy of conservation. They are in strong decline
   in extension and are threatened by abandonment throughout Europe. It is
   known that grasslands management (grazing, mowing) acts as driving force
   in plant community diversity, which in turn is an important conservation
   aim of European environmental policies. The area of current pastoral
   landscape (about 1000 ha) of the North Adriatic (Cicarija, Croatia) was
   studied in order: 1/ to understand which factors drive floristic
   differentiation - environmental features and/or grassland management
   conditions, 2/ to identify indicator species sets linked to those
   factors and 3/ to appraise the effects of management type on the
   coenological and functional composition of indicator species. 73
   phytosociological releves were carried out; for each of them field data
   (altitude, aspect, slope and land form), productivity measurements and
   information on grassland management were collected. Redundancy analysis
   (RDA) identified a productivity-related soil moisture gradient as the
   environmental driving force of grassland floristic differentiation.
   Indicator species analysis (ISA) detected the indicator species sets
   related to environmental features and management type. The results
   indicate that undergrazing and the lack of periodic mowing are
   responsible for the higher total variance of floristic data set
   explained by environmental parameters rather than by management (use/not
   use). For the same reasons, the variations that emerged from comparison
   of the functional characteristics of the indicator species of grazing
   and of mowing (avoidance strategy, life form, and storage organs) proved
   more important than those observed in comparing used and abandoned
   grasslands. The management system adopted (grazing or mowing) appears in
   turn to be conditioned by the soil moisture/productivity gradient.}},

Abstract = {{The invasion of exotic pasture species into intact woodlands has the
   potential to affect native fauna by altering habitat structure and
   ecosystem function. The spread of these weeds is generally in concert
   with cattle grazing, so that fauna or habitat change is due to multiple
   interrelated causes.
   In this study we investigated whether the spread of the introduced
   pasture grass Bothriochloa pertusa and replacement of the native
   bluegrass B. ewartiana in eucalypt woodlands of northern Queensland has
   had an effect on terrestrial vertebrate fauna. We located 40 sites that
   sampled a range of native and introduced pastures cover, and
   investigated the spatial pattern of abundance with canonical analysis of
   principle coordinates, and correlation of the habitat attributes on the
   ordination space. We then selected a subset of four habitat attributes
   (eliminating highly colinear variables) and modelled species response to
   each using an information-theoretic approach. Thirty-one species (26
   birds, one mammal and four reptiles) and two summary variables (bird
   abundance and richness) had best subset Akaike Information Criteria
   models with reliable parameters estimates.
   Seventeen models contained the B. pertusa frequency term and a further
   16 had a term relating to upper storey cover (tree cover > 10, 5-10 or
   3-5 m). Though pasture grass cover, grazing and habitat features were
   correlated and thus we cannot ascribe B. pertusa as the sole determinant
   of fauna species change, this study has demonstrated that tropical
   savanna woodlands with changing Bothriochloa dominance from native to
   introduced species have different fauna species composition. In
   particular bird species richness, ground nesting species (e.g. rufous
   songlark Cincloramphus mathewsi, golden-headed cisticola Cisticola
   exilis) and terrestrial reptiles (e.g. Carlia munda and Ctenotus
   taeniolatus) declined. Disturbance-tolerant species such as Australian
   magpie Cracticus tibicen and yellow-throated miners Manorina flavigula
   increased in abundance in exotic pasture-dominated sites. As pastoral
   intensification continues in northern Australian rangelands there is a
   potential for significant change in the relative abundance and
   composition of vertebrate fauna and the reduction or loss of some
   species in the landscape.}},

   of species richness, and the relative value of managed and unmanaged
   grasslands, by studying closely located and floristically similar mown
   and abandoned stands of fen and dry-mesophilous meadows. We found that a
   higher proportion of the target species detected in aboveground
   vegetation possessed persistent seed banks in fen meadows than in
   dry-mesophilous ones (44 and 29\%, respectively). The proportion of
   target species found exclusively in the seed bank was much lower (11\%
   for both meadow types). Conversely, common rushes (Juncus conglomeratus
   and J. effusus), mostly missing from the vegetation, dominated the seed
   banks in all fen meadow plots (50-94\% of total seed densities) and were
   also detected in seed banks of dry-mesophilous meadows. We found that
   resumed mowing on previously abandoned meadows has promoted species
   richness and the flowering success of several species in comparison with
   unmanaged ones in both meadow types. Vegetation type had a stronger
   influence on seed bank richness and density than management status and

Abstract = {{An evaluation of changes in nematode populations in response to

   Four levels of decreasing intensity were measured over three growing
   seasons. The treatments included: 1) intensive grazing management where
   cows were allowed to graze for each grazing cycle, followed by routine
   clipping and harrowing; 2) semi-intensive grazing where cows were
   allowed to graze for each grazing cycle, with only one clipping event
   per year; 3) extensive grazing where cows were allowed to graze during
   every 2nd grazing cycle and no clipping or harrowing was performed; 4)
   stockpiling treatment where cows were permitted to graze only during the
   final grazing cycle, followed by clipping at the end of the season. Most
   indices (MI, PPI, Sigma MI, and Sigma MI25) resulted in significant
   seasonal differences; however, only familial diversity (H') and the
   total number of families showed significant season by treatment
   interaction. Bacterivores comprised most of the nematode population with
   Cephalobidae being the most common family. Abundance of plant feeders
   was affected by season and soil moisture, whereas bacterivore abundance
   was associated with total organic N and soil pH. Nematode body length
   increased slightly in most families through time, and was associated
   with season, bulk density, soil moisture, and total N and C. Although
   omnivore numbers were highest in the extensive and semi-intensive
   treatments, there was a significant increase in dorylaimid body length

   rate was 32\% (SD = 14) when meadows were mown with rotary mowers

   the estimated mortality caused by the machineries, presumably because
   orthopteran reduction includes a small emigration and natural mortality.

Abstract = {{The increasing world population and demand for food and other products

   lands, plantations and urban areas. Changes in habitat and landscape
   characteristics due to land-use change can have a significant effect on
   species presence, abundance, and distribution. Multi-scale approaches
   have been used to determine the proper spatial scales at which species
   and communities are responding to habitat transformation. In this
   context, we evaluated medium and large mammal species richness and
   composition in gallery forest (n = 10), grassland (n = 10), and exotic
   tree plantation (n = 10) in a region where grasslands have been
   converted into exotic tree plantations. We quantified mammal species
   richness and composition with camera traps and track surveys. The
   composition of the mammal community was related with local habitat
   variables, and landscape variables measured at seven spatial scales. We
   found 14 mammal species in forest, 11 species in plantation, and 7
   mammal species in grassland. Two species are exotics, the wild boar Sus
   scrota Linnaeus, 1 758 and the European hare Lepus europoeus Pallas,
   1778. The most common species are the crab-eating fox Cerdocyon thous

   1 758 and the gray brocket deer Mazama gouazoubira G. Fischer, 1814

   in mammal species richness and composition among the three habitat
   types. Plantations can have positive and negative effects on the
   presence of species restricted to grasslands. Positive effects are
   reflected in a wider local distribution of some forest species that
   rarely use grassland. The most important habitat and landscape variables
   that influenced mammal species richness and composition were vertical
   structure index, canopy cover, tree species diversity, percentage of
   grass, and the percentage of forest and grassland at the landscape scale
   of 0.1 km. We advise the following important measures for conservation
   of this mammal community: 1) reduce logging and cattle grazing in

Abstract = {{Hydroids are broadly reported in epiphytic associations from different
   localities showing marked seasonal cycles. Studies have shown that the
   factors behind these seasonal differences in hydroid richness and
   abundance may vary significantly according to the area of study.
   Seasonal differences in epiphytic hydroid cover and richness were
   evaluated in a Sargassum cymosum C. Agardh bed from Lazar beach, at
   Ubatuba, Brazil. Significant seasonal differences were found in total
   hydroid cover, but not in species richness. Hydroid cover increased from
   March (early fall) to February (summer). Most of this pattern was caused
   by two of the most abundant species: Aglaophenia latecarinata Allman,
   1877 and Orthopyxis sargassicola (Nutting, 1915). Hydroid richness seems
   to be related to S. cymosum size but not directly to its biomass. The
   seasonal differences in hydroid richness and algal cover are shown to be
   similar to other works in the study region and in the Mediterranean.
   Seasonal recruitment of hydroid species larvae may be responsible for
   their seasonal differences in algal cover, although other factors such
   as grazing activity of gammarid amphipods on S. cymosum must be taken
   into account.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions affect virtually all ecosystems on earth, but the
   degree to which different regions and biomes are invaded, and the
   quality of information from different regions, varies greatly. A large
   body of literature exists on the invasion of savannas in the Neotropics
   and northern Australia where invasive plants, especially African
   grasses, have had major impacts. Less has been published on plant
   invasions in African savannas, except for those in South Africa.
   Negative impacts due to plant invasions in African savannas appear to be
   less severe than in other regions at present. As savannas cover about
   60\% of the continent, with tens of millions of people relying on the
   services they provide, it is timely to assess the current status of
   invasions as a threat to these ecosystems. We reviewed the literature,
   contrasting the African situation with that of Neotropical and
   Australian savannas. A number of drivers and explanatory factors of
   plant invasions in savannas have been described, mostly from the
   Neotropics and Australia. These include herbivore presence, residence
   time, intentional introductions for pasture improvements, fire regimes,
   the physiology of the introduced species, and anthropogenic disturbance.
   After comparing these drivers across the three regions, we suggest that
   the lower extent of alien plant invasions in African savannas is largely
   attributable to: (1) significantly lower rates of intentional plant
   introductions and widespread plantings (until recently); (2) the role of
   large mammalian herbivores in these ecosystems; (3) historical and
   biogeographical issues relating to the regions of origin of introduced
   species; and (4) the adaptation of African systems to fire. We discuss
   how changing conditions in the three regions are likely to affect plant
   invasions in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The rivers and streams in the pampean plains are characterized by a low
   flow rate due to the low slope of the surrounding terrain, high levels
   of suspended solids, silty sediment in the benthos, and reduced rithron;
   the riparian forest of this region has been replaced by low-altitude
   grasslands. Many of these environments contain a wide coverage of
   aquatic reeds, both submerged and floating, making the pampas
   limologically extraordinary. These terrains have undergone a gradual
   transformation in response to the progress of urbanization and
   agricultural activity in recent years with a resulting loss of
   biodiversity, leaving only few sites that continue to reflect the
   original characteristics of the region. Because of human activities in
   combination with the global climate change, variations have occurred in
   biological communities that are reflected in the structure and function
   of populations and assemblages of algae, macrophytes, and invertebrate
   fauna or in the eutrophication of affected ecosystems. The objective of
   this article is to describe the principal limnologic characteristics of
   the streams that traverse the Buenos Aires Province and relate these
   features with the predicted future global changes for the area under
   study. Considering the future climate-change scenarios proposed for the
   pampean region, the projected increment in rainfall will affect the
   biological communities. Higher rainfall may enhance the erosion and
   generate floodings; increasing the transport of sediments, nutrients,
   and contaminants to the ocean and affecting the degree of water
   mineralization. Changes in discharge and turbidity may affect light
   penetration in the water column as well as its residence time. The
   modifications in the use of the soil will probably favor the input of
   nutrients. This latter effect will favor autotrophy, particularly by
   those species capable of generating strategies for surviving in more
   turbid and enriched environments. An accelerated eutrophication will
   change the composition of the consumers in preference to herbivores and
   detritivores. The increase in global population projected for the next
   years will demand more food, and this situation coupled with the new
   scenarios of climate change will lead to profound socioeconomic changes
   in the pampean area, implying an increase in demand for water resources
   and land uses.}},

Abstract = {{Changes of pasture communities consequent to management practices
   resulting from land abandonment considerably affect the structure and
   function of the ecosystem. This study analyses the consequences of
   grazing abandonment in terms of plant and soil microbial diversity and
   fertility, on a Mediterranean upland sheep pasture, over a short period
   (five years). Grazing was experimentally excluded by fencing ten 10x10 m
   permanent plots within an area that had supported grazing until 2000, by
   0.23 sheep ha-1. Plant and soil microbial communities and
   physicochemical parameters were monitored within the fenced and unfenced
   control plots, during three sampling times from 2000 (before the
   fencing) to 2005. Grazing cessation notably altered the floral
   composition, with an average dissimilarity of 96.7\% between the
   vegetation communities, over five years. No significant change occurred
   in the control plots that were grazed throughout the sampling period.
   This work highlighted that, over a short term, the structural change in
   the specific plant composition affected only the grass species,
   confirming that grazing favours the small-sized species over the annual
   species. Further, it was evident that species groups of conservational
   and phytogeographic interest, like the endemic and
   Mediterranean-Atlantic species, tended to disappear with pasture
   abandonment and were substituted by more widespread species throughout
   the Mediterranean or even the world. Pasture abandonment was accompanied
   by an increase of soil pH and a decrease in soil organic matter and soil
   nitrogen. The microbial parameters recorded at three different sampling
   times revealed a substantial effect of the plant community, or the time
   of grazing abandonment, on soil microbial abundance and diversity.
   Considerable importance is given to the consequences of pasture
   abandonment on the conservation of plant and microbial diversity and on
   soil fertility. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three years after a river restoration scheme in the Syr Valley
   (Luxembourg) we investigated habitat development and habitat use of
   Galloway cattle deployed in a low-intensity grazing system on a
   permanent floodplain pasture. Habitats were delimited with a mobile
   GPS/GIS mapping system and their spatial development was assessed over
   three consecutive years. During these three years, the patches of the
   six habitats decreased to 40\% of mean initial size, and a rapid net
   area expansion of wetland habitats (large sedge swamps: +100\%, marsh
   and tall forb grasslands: +43\%) was observed. The behavioural patterns
   and grazing preferences of the cattle were observed directly during the
   vegetation period in June, August and November. These observations were
   complemented by a transect analysis of cattle impact indicators in June
   and November. The cattle grazed the different habitats very selectively,
   as they preferred the mesophilic, and ruderal grasslands 1.6, and 5.6
   times more than expected respectively. During the growing season, the
   grazing niche breadth declined (3.92 in June to 2.68 in November), and
   less preferred forage habitats like large sedge swamps were grazed
   primarily in the autumn. We used bite and step rates to investigate
   grazing intensity by habitat type. During summer, grazing intensity
   correlated with forage quality in the different habitat patches, whereas
   in autumn it was obviously influenced by the effort required to access
   the desired forage plants in a given habitat. The impact indicators
   revealed a matter transfer from riparian areas to the valley edge. Here,

Abstract = {{1. Temperate semi-natural grasslands are characterized by high levels of
   species diversity and have a high conservation value. Plant species
   diversity in grazed semi-natural grasslands is known to be influenced by
   management intensity and habitat connectivity. Both grazing pressure and
   between-patch connectivity are expected to depend on the movement
   patterns of livestock in the landscape.
   2. The present study examines associations between fine-scale (within
   0.25 m(2) plots) plant species diversity in semi-natural grasslands and
   present grazing intensity, present and historical habitat connectivity,
   and the (present and historical) distance from the nearest village. The
   study area was a local (4.5 x 4.5 km) agricultural landscape on the
   island of Oland, Sweden.
   3. Fine-scale (Shannon) diversity and species richness were unimodally
   associated with the distance from the nearest historical (ad 1800)
   village, with maximum values c. 1-1.5 km from villages. These
   associations suggest that the distance from historical villages behaves
   as an integrated descriptor of variation in long-termmanagement
   intensity (livestock movements) and reflects aspects of the functional
   connectivity between plant communities in semi-natural grasslands.
   4. Groups of variables characterizing village distances, grazing
   pressure and habitat connectivity had overlapping effects on species
   diversity. Grazing intensity had the largest individual impact on
   diversity, followed by the distance from the nearest historical village
   and present-day habitat connectivity.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The study indicates the importance of
   viewing grassland diversity in the context of local landscape history.
   Unimodal associations between fine-scale plant species diversity and the
   distance from the nearest village in ad 1800 suggest that information on
   the proximity to villages in the historical landscape has a potential
   use in conservation planning - as an indicator of variation in long-term
   grassland management intensity. Conservation programmes for grazed
   temperate grasslands should (1) give priority to old grasslands with an
   uninterrupted history of grazing management, (2) ensure a moderate
   grazing intensity, (3) avoid overgrazing and/or long breaks in the
   continuity of grazing management.}},

Abstract = {{Although considerable research has focused on the relationship between

   characteristics, species composition and richness with eco-hydrological
   functions remain unclear. We measured water adherence (i.e. the capacity
   of a plant species to retain water), documented plant surface morphology
   and observed surface runoff at three sites in China. The adhering water
   ratios for each plant species differed, ranging from 17.1\% to 151.5\%
   in leaves, and from 14.4\% to 41.1\% in branches. Small, light-weight,
   soft, non-cuticularized leaves that were densely situated on small
   branches showed good water adherence. The next best adherence was found
   by branches with intermediately coarse surfaces. The plant species with
   high standing biomass also showed good water adherence, and the
   contribution of a species to total adherence was dependent upon its
   aboveground standing biomass. Vegetation parameters strongly affected
   water adherence, whereas the effect of species richness was not
   significant. Conversely, species richness showed a significant influence
   on surface runoff. The effect of plant morphological characteristics and
   composition constitutes a basic process in the regulation of
   eco-hydrological function, and vegetation parameters play somewhat
   different roles in that regulation. The key roles must therefore be

Abstract = {{The current dramatic increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration favours

   Current knowledge suggests that important changes in herbivore
   performance could be observed, but is too fragmentary to allow general

Abstract = {{Understanding the coupling between plant functional traits and abundance
   provides insight into the often hidden forces that structure plant
   communities. To better understand the coupling between leaf traits and
   abundance of grassland species in a mesic North American grassland, we
   measured specific leaf area (SLA) and its two components, tissue density
   and thickness for 125 grassland species. Plants with high tissue density
   were more abundant over a 17-year period across a range of environments:
   uplands, grazed and ungrazed watersheds, and frequently and infrequently
   burned watersheds. The consistent relationships between leaf tissue
   density and abundance across ecological contrasts imply that belowground
   resource availability constrains community composition independent of
   grazing and burning regimes. Leaf tissue density did not explain species
   abundance in lowlands, where belowground resources are the highest.
   Neither did it explain the differential abundance of species between
   grazing or fire frequency contrasts, suggesting that changes in burning
   or grazing select for species based on other traits. Relative to leaf
   tissue density, SLA was a poor predictor of abundance, reinforcing a
   long-observed-but often ignored-call that measurements of SLA need to be
   coupled with thickness measurements in order to effectively predict the
   performance of species. More generally, future research needs to
   investigate which belowground resources control community composition in

Abstract = {{Biodiversity is rapidly declining(1), and this may negatively affect
   ecosystem processes(2), including economically important ecosystem
   services(3). Previous studies have shown that biodiversity has positive
   effects on organisms and processes(4) across trophic levels(5). However,
   only a few studies have so far incorporated an explicit food-web
   perspective(6). In an eight-year biodiversity experiment, we studied an
   unprecedented range of above-and below-ground organisms and multitrophic
   interactions. A multitrophic data set originating from a single
   long-term experiment allows mechanistic insights that would not be
   gained from meta-analysis of different experiments. Here we show that
   plant diversity effects dampen with increasing trophic level and degree
   of omnivory. This was true both for abundance and species richness of
   organisms. Furthermore, we present comprehensive
   above-ground/below-ground biodiversity food webs. Both above ground and
   below ground, herbivores responded more strongly to changes in plant
   diversity than did carnivores or omnivores. Density and richness of
   carnivorous taxa was independent of vegetation structure. Below-ground
   responses to plant diversity were consistently weaker than above-ground
   responses. Responses to increasing plant diversity were generally
   positive, but were negative for biological invasion, pathogen
   infestation and hyperparasitism. Our results suggest that plant
   diversity has strong bottom-up effects on multitrophic interaction
   networks, with particularly strong effects on lower trophic levels.
   Effects on higher trophic levels are indirectly mediated through
   bottom-up trophic cascades.}},

Abstract = {{The temperate deciduous forest on the northern slopes of the Alborz

   areas are still old-growth forest but logging and grazing have degraded

   state In this study we present an analytical and a numerical solution to
   the forest management problem by optimizing the benefits of livestock
   production timber harvest and biodiversity conservation We focus on the
   ecological interactions rather than on administrative restrictions Our
   findings are based both on theoretical considerations and field
   investigations of ecological and economic parameters in Azerbaijan and
   Iran The results of the numerical optimization suggest that it is
   optimal to separate timber and livestock production if biodiversity is
   not valued Livestock rearing is preferable at high discount rates
   whereas timber production becomes more profitable at low discount rates
   If the valuation of diversity exceeds a certain threshold a combination

Abstract = {{Although vascular epiphytes contribute substantially to the biodiversity
   of tropical montane forests, it is unclear how their diversity and
   community composition is affected by forest alteration. We studied the
   response of vascular epiphyte assemblages to different intensities of
   land-use in a montane wet forest of northeastern Ecuador: (1) unmanaged
   mature forest; (2) mature forest with mid- and understorey opened for
   cattle grazing; and (3) isolated remnant trees in cattle pastures. The
   numbers of individuals and species of epiphytes per host tree did not
   differ significantly between land-use types, neither did total epiphyte
   species richness (n = 30 trees). However, total species richness of
   pteridophytes was significantly lower on isolated remnant trees compared
   to unmanaged forest, whereas several taxa rich in xerotolerant species
   (Bromeliaceae, Orchidaceae, Piperaceae) exhibited the opposite trend. An
   analysis of floristic composition using ordination (NMS) and
   randomisation techniques (MRPP) showed that epiphyte assemblages on
   isolated remnant trees were significantly distinct from unmanaged forest
   while managed forest was intermediate between those two vegetation
   types. Ordination analysis further indicated reduced floristic
   heterogeneity in disturbed habitats. These results suggest considerable,
   rapid species turnover since land-use change 6 years prior to study,
   with pteridophytes being replaced by more xerotolerant taxa. We
   attribute this floristic turnover primarily to changes in microclimate
   towards higher levels of light and desiccation stress associated with
   forest disturbance. Our results support the notion that community
   composition offers a more sensitive indicator of human disturbance than
   species richness. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional ranching in Chiapas, Mexico typically includes annual
   pasture burns and agrochemical use that decrease the biodiversity and
   forest cover of ranch lands. Members of a holistic ranching ``club{''}
   in the Frailesca region of Chiapas, Mexico have moved away from this
   conventional management by eliminating burns and agrochemicals from
   their systems after decades of use because they believed that the land
   and their production process were growing unhealthy; they were further
   motivated by extension courses on holistic ranching. They have also
   implemented sophisticated systems of rotational grazing and diversified
   the use of trees. For this study all seven holistic ranchers and 18
   neighboring conventional ranchers were interviewed about their cattle
   ranches and production strategies. An emergy analysis was conducted to
   compare the resource use, productivity and sustainability of the
   conventional and holistic ranches. Holistic ranches were found to have
   double the emergy sustainability index (ESI) values of conventional
   ranches, and the emergy yield ratio was 25\% higher in holistic systems.
   Government assistance programs were found to have a negative impact on
   the ESI and were variably administered among holistic ranchers during
   the year of emergy evaluation. Overall improved emergy sustainability
   did not decrease milk nor cattle productivity. Transformities and
   specific emergies, the emergy of one type required to make a unit of
   energy (transformity) or mass (specific emergy) of another type, did not
   differ between conventional and holistic systems. Transformities for
   milk production ranged between 3.4E5 and 1.2E7 solar emjoules/joule
   (sej/J). Specific emergy for cattle production ranged from 3.5E10 to
   1.5E11 sej/g. To improve the ESI assistance programs could be
   re-targeted toward incentive programs for increased forest cover in
   ranching systems and startup costs for holistic ranching. The results
   from this study show that productivity can be maintained as the
   sustainability of rural dairy ranches is increased. These results also
   show that local knowledge and understanding of the surrounding ecosystem
   can drive positive environmental change in production systems. (C) 2010

Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Predicting the response of plant communities to variation in resources
   and disturbance is still a challenge, because findings depend on how
   ecological gradients are characterized and how grassland functional
   composition is assessed. Focusing on leaf dry matter content (LDMC), the
   efficacy of different methods for evaluating the best response of plant
   communities to either environmental or disturbance change is examined.
   Data were collected on 69 grasslands located at four sites in the
   Pyrenees and Massif Central. N-Ellenberg indices and plant nutrient
   content (Ni) were compared to assess fertility, and either LDMC (meas)
   measured or calculated from a trait database for which traits were
   measured under the same environmental conditions (db). Management regime
   (MR) was characterized in terms of categories (grazing, cutting) and
   plant height.
   LDMCdb was positively correlated to LDMCmeas, but depended significantly
   on site temperature. N-Ellenberg and Ni were significantly correlated,
   and there was a significant effect of MR and temperature. LDMC responded
   to fertility, MR and temperature. Replacing MR by plant height in an
   REML analysis reduced the uncertainty of the LDMC prediction. LDMC was
   correlated to plant height at community level, whereas the correlation
   was weak at species level. Differences in LDMC between plant communities
   under any of the management regimes were significantly correlated to the
   standing herbage mass.
   The N-Ellenberg index is a better indicator of fertility than Ni which
   is short-term and environment-dependent. LDMC taken from a database
   allows plant trait variation due to species abundance (excluding
   variation due to trait plasticity in response to management) to be
   captured. So the former is better suited for assessing agricultural
   services that mainly depend on plant phenology and tissue composition.
   LDMC responded to defoliation regime in addition to fertility because
   plant height is roughly correlated with LDMC at plant community level.}},

   two different key alpine vegetation types (Type 1 Trifolium alpinum

   Alchemilla xanthochlora, and Phleum alpinum) Bulk milk was collected

   the bulk milks and cheeses varied with the type of vegetation Milk and
   cheese derived from cows that were grazed on Trifolium alpinum-dominated
   pastures were richer in long-chain FAs, unsaturated and monounsaturated
   FAs (particularly oleic acid) and odd-chain saturated FAs (such as C15 0

   FAs and alpha-linolenic acid Furthermore our results showed that in
   alpine grazing systems milk and cheese FA profiles changed when cows
   were grazed on pastures with a different botanical composition, probably
   due to differences in forage quality and concentration of bioactive
   secondary metabolites These results have to be taken into account for

Abstract = {{Improved management of carbon storage by terrestrial biomes has
   significant value for mitigating climate change. The carbon value of
   such management has the potential to provide additional income to rural
   communities and provide biodiversity and climate adaptation co-benefits.
   Here, we quantify the carbon stores in a 49,300-ha landscape centered on
   the cloud forest-grassland transition of the high Andes in Manu National
   Park, Peru. Aboveground carbon densities were measured across the
   landscape by field sampling of 70 sites above and below the treeline.
   The forest near the treeline contained 63.4 +/- A 5.2 Mg C ha(-1)
   aboveground, with an additional 13.9 +/- A 2.8 Mg C ha(-1) estimated to
   be stored in the coarse roots, using a root to shoot ratio of 0.26. Puna
   grasslands near the treeline were found to store 7.5 +/- A 0.7 Mg C
   ha(-1) in aboveground biomass. Comparing our result to soil data
   gathered by Zimmermann and others (Ecosystems 13:62-74, 2010), we found
   the ratio of belowground:aboveground carbon decreased from 15.8 on the
   puna to 8.6 in the transition zone and 2.1 in the forest. No significant
   relationships were found between carbon densities and slope, altitude or
   fire disturbance history, though grazing (for puna) was found to reduce
   aboveground carbon densities significantly. We scaled our study sites to
   the study region with remote sensing observations from Landsat. The
   carbon sequestration potential of improved grazing management and
   assisted upslope treeline migration was also estimated. Afforestation of
   puna at the treeline could generate revenues of US \$1,374 per ha over
   the project lifetime via commercialization of the carbon credits from
   gains in aboveground carbon stocks. Uncertainties in the fate of the
   large soil carbon stocks under an afforestation scenario exist.}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{1. It is well documented that cattle reduce their grazing activity in
   the vicinity of cattle dung, which gives rise to distinct patches, or
   islets as they have been termed, of longer sward. The influence of such
   islets on pasture utilisation and agronomic performance has been widely
   studied, but very little information is available concerning their
   influence on grassland biodiversity.
   2. In this study the abundance and distribution of arthropods in
   relation to islets was assessed, using suction sampling, at 26
   commercial farms and in a replicated pasture management experiment in
   the south and east of Ireland.
   3. Islets were found to cover approximately 24\% of pastures and to
   contain between 40\% and 50\% of arthropod individuals.
   4. Islets consistently contained a higher density of arthropods, even
   when the difference in mean sward height between islets and more
   strongly grazed sward was accounted for. The relative concentration of
   arthropods in islets declined with increasing mean sward height, which
   may be related to the recovery of well-grazed non-islet sward. Islets
   appear to act as refugia from sward removal.
   5. The potential importance of islets in maintaining arthropod
   biodiversity within intensively grazed pastures and the wider
   grass-based farming landscape is discussed, particularly with reference
   to standard agronomic practices such as sward topping and chain
   harrowing, which aim to remove the sward heterogeneity created by
   grazing livestock.}},

Abstract = {{African savannas are primarily used as pastures and are subject to
   changes in climate and management strategies. For sustainable management
   of these landscapes ecological knowledge on seasonal and long-term
   variability in plant community composition and the availability of green
   biomass is essential. In this study, we assessed the effects of dry and
   wet season on species richness and beta diversity for three sites along
   a gradient of increasing vegetation cover and precipitation in northwest
   Namibia. A hexagonal systematic sampling design was used to record
   floristic data. The Simple Matching, Soerensen, and multi-plot
   similarity coefficient and distance decay analyses were applied for
   examining beta diversity. Analyses were repeated while separating the
   plots according to the presence of woody vegetation. Species richness
   nearly doubled from dry to wet season; compositional similarity
   increased from dry to wet season and with increasing aridity of the
   study sites: distance decay was more pronounced in the dry season
   without any link to the precipitation gradient. Woody elements in the
   landscape, which occur along drainage lines or as tree islands, govern
   spatial and seasonal plant diversity fluctuations. Monitoring them is
   important for conservation strategies and for establishing grazing rules

Abstract = {{Crop-livestock systems are regaining their importance as an alternative
   to unsustainable intensive farming systems. Loss of biodiversity,
   nutrient pollution and habitat fragmentation are a few of many concerns
   recently reported with modern agriculture. Integrating crops and
   pastures in no-till systems can result in better environmental services,
   since conservation agriculture is improved by system diversity, paths of
   nutrient flux, and other processes common in nature. The presence of
   large herbivores can positively modify nutrient pathways and soil
   aggregation, increasing soil quality. Despite the low diversity
   involved, the integration of crops and pastures enhances nature's
   biomimicry and allows attainment of a higher system organization level.
   This paper illustrates these benefits focusing on the use of grazing
   animals integrated with crops under no-tillage systems characteristic of
   southern Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{Successful prairie restoration will depend in part on convincing private
   landowners with agricultural and recreational use goals to implement
   appropriate rangeland management practices, such as prescribed burning
   and cattle grazing, to control invasive species and encroachment of
   woody plants. However, landowners have been slow to adopt appropriate
   practices in the US Midwest. The purpose of this study was to explore
   attitudes and behaviors of private landowners toward prescribed burning
   and moderate stocking as rangeland management tools. A survey was mailed
   to 193 landowners (response rate 51\%) in the Grand River Grasslands
   region of southern Iowa and northern Missouri. While 68\% of landowners
   viewed grazing as a legitimate land management tool, only half of
   landowners thought of fire as a legitimate tool. Over 75\% of
   respondents believed that the increase in eastern redcedar and other
   trees in grasslands was a problem, with 44\% considering it a major
   problem. Although 84\% of landowners said that they had taken action to
   control eastern redcedar, only 25\% had participated in a prescribed
   burn. Income from agriculture and recreational goals were negatively and
   significantly correlated (-0.252, P = 0.035). While holding recreational
   goals constant in the analysis, landowners reporting income from
   agriculture goals as very or extremely important were negatively and
   significantly associated with reporting environment and grassland
   factors as very or extremely important. Adoption of prescribed burning
   by private landowners might be more widespread if proponents focus on
   the effectiveness of fire for controlling eastern redcedar, which is
   viewed as a problem by most landowners in the region. Intervention
   efforts must include landowners with different goals as part of the
   promotion and educational process.}},

Abstract = {{Management of rangelands has largely operated under the paradigm of
   minimizing spatially discrete disturbances, often under the objective of
   reducing inherent heterogeneity within managed ecosystems. This has led
   to a simplified understanding of rangelands and in many cases simplified
   rangelands. We argue that this type of management focus is incapable of
   maintaining biodiversity. An evolutionary model of disturbance
   (pyric-herbivory) suggests that grazing and fire interact through a
   series of feedbacks to cause a shifting mosaic of vegetation patterns
   across the landscape and has potential to serve as a model for
   management of grasslands with an evolutionary history of grazing. Our
   study demonstrates that the spatially controlled interaction of fire and
   grazing can be used to create heterogeneity in grassland ecosystems and
   the resulting heterogeneity in vegetation is expressed through other
   trophic levels, specifically small mammals in this study. Discrete fires
   were applied to patches, and patchy grazing by herbivores promoted a
   shifting vegetation mosaic across the landscape that created unique
   habitat structures for various small mammal species. Peromyscus
   maniculatus was about 10 times more abundant on recently burned patches
   (1-2 mo) than the uniform treatment or unburned patches within the
   shifting mosaic treatment. Chaetodipus hispidus was about 10 times
   greater in patches that were 15-20 mu post-fire in the shifting mosaic
   treatment than in the uniform treatment. Sigmodon hispidus, Microtus
   ochrogaster, and Reithrodontomys fluvescens became dominant in the
   shifting mosaic in patches that were more than 2 yr post-fire. This
   study, along with others, suggests that by managing transient focal
   patches, heterogeneity has the potential to be a new central paradigm
   for conservation of rangeland ecosystems and can enhance biological
   diversity and maintain livestock production across broad scales.}},

Abstract = {{Eutrophication of two urban temperate dimictic lakes in Berlin
   (Germany), smaller Schlachtensee (0.4 km2) and larger Lake Tegel (3
   km2), caused total phosphorus (TP) concentrations up to 800 mu g/L and a
   complete loss of their diverse submerged vegetation in the 1960s due to
   poor light conditions. Phosphorus stripping of their inflow began in the
   1980s and caused a pronounced decline of their epilimnetic TP
   concentrations, eventually leading to reduced phytoplankton biomass and
   turbidity. Despite increased light availability, recovery of abundance
   as well as species diversity of submerged macrophytes was delayed by
   more than a decade, especially in the smaller lake. Slow oxidization of
   sapropelic sediment unsuitable for macrophyte growth, periphyton
   shading, herbivory, and/or lack of a viable seed bank were potential
   hampering factors. The present submerged vegetation, however, may
   already support mechanisms positively influencing water transparency
   such as providing habitat to enhance the ratio of piscivorous to
   planktivorous fish. Characeae meadows, typical for both lakes during
   their former mesotrophic state, so far only reoccurred in smaller
   Schlachtensee. Neither species composition nor abundance reversed back
   to the macrophyte community present in the nineteenth century. Although
   TP concentrations may decline further and some rare species have been
   detected, reassembly of this plant community will most probably not
   occur because many submerged macrophyte species have become rare
   throughout northwest Europe.}},

   established, probably from a persistent diaspore bank or from refugia

Abstract = {{Changes in land-use have resulted in the decline of many formerly common
   plants of nutrient-poor grasslands in Europe. Recently, extensification
   schemes have been applied at sites in order to restore former habitat
   conditions. However, the establishment of rare and endangered plants is
   often severely limited by the lack of propagules both in the seed bank
   and in the surrounding landscape. For such species deliberate
   introductions may be necessary to overcome these limitations. In a
   7-year study, we assessed the importance of gaps created by sod cutting,
   of plant stage, and of plant origin for the restoration of populations
   of Scorzonera humilis, a threatened long-lived plant of nutrient-poor,
   wet grasslands. The effect of gaps on seedling emergence and survival
   varied strongly among the 12 sites. Gaps increased survival at
   nutrient-rich, but reduced it at nutrient-poor sites. Remarkably, young
   plants grown for only 5 weeks in the laboratory and transplanted into
   the same sites had much higher survival than seedlings from seeds sown
   and there were no differences in survival between nutrient-rich and
   nutrient-poor sites. The field performance of the plants from the
   various populations of origin varied depending on the site into which
   they were transplanted, indicating genotype by environment interactions
   and genetic differentiation among populations, but there was no
   home-site advantage. While sowing only succeeded in producing adult
   plants in five sites, transplanting succeeded at 10 sites. Our results
   suggest that transplanting young plants could be a much more effective
   and faster way to establish new populations than sowing seeds.}},

Abstract = {{In 2003, the Syr River was redirected from a channel running along the
   valley edge into a slightly reshaped riverbed on the valley floor, after
   which, in 2004, a low intensity (1.0 livestock units ha(-1)), year-round
   grazing system with Galloway cattle was introduced on a 24 ha floodplain
   pasture. 200 permanent plots were randomly distributed on the floodplain
   pasture to study vegetation development between 2004 and 2006 under the
   influence of the combined rewetting and grazing regime. The effect of
   grazing was investigated separately in 16 grazing exclosures (comprising
   64 grazed and 64 control plots) in different habitat types during
   2005-2007. At each plot, vegetation composition was surveyed using a
   decimal scale to determine cover estimates, and vegetation structure and
   grazing impact indicators were determined. Non-metric multidimensional
   scaling revealed that the restoration measures triggered a marked
   short-term shift in vegetation composition. The intensity and direction
   of this shift varied clearly along a topographical gradient in the
   floodplain. Species richness increased significantly, and typical
   wetland species and Red Data Book species were favoured in the riparian
   area. Grazing hindered rapid species turnover since the turnover rate in
   grazed plots (from 2006 to 2007: 0.29) was significantly (p < 0.05)
   lower than in control plots (0.35). Species richness differed
   significantly (p < 0.001) between 15.8 species per plot in the grazed to
   10.1 in the control treatment (in 2007). The short-term trial suggests
   that river restoration and moderate grazing in combination may represent
   a promising strategy for the restoration of floodplain wetlands. (C)

   habitat quality for different target species. An overall evaluation of
   the scenarios indicates that decoupling has a limited effect, because
   higher direct payments compensate the effect of lower product prices. If
   all payments are strictly targeted to agri-environmental measures and
   set to a level which guarantees a low-input management of the grassland,
   the public costs could be reduced and additional habitats for the target

Abstract = {{Woody plant encroachment into grasslands generally increases spatial
   heterogeneity of soil properties and processes and creates ``islands of

   the potential for these changes to influence spatial variation in soil
   fauna. We quantified population sizes, biodiversity, and trophic
   structure of soil nematode communities in a savanna parkland where woody
   plant clusters developed in grassland during the past century. Total
   nematode density was constant across transects from centers of woody
   clusters into grasslands. Family richness and Simpson's Dominance Index
   indicated nematode communities in grasslands and grassland/cluster edges
   were significantly more diverse than positions within the woody
   clusters. Relative densities of all nematode trophic groups changed
   significantly along the transect. Bacterivores nearly doubled in
   relative density from grassland (35\%) to cluster centers (60\%),
   apparently in response to higher concentrations of soil microbial
   biomass in wooded areas. Relative densities of plant parasitic nematodes
   decreased along transects from grasslands (35\%) to centers of woody
   clusters (10\%), implying decreased nematode herbivory in woody clusters
   despite much higher root biomass there. The structure index indicated
   nematode communities within woody clusters were more simplified than
   those in grassland and edge communities due to reductions in densities
   of omnivores and predators. Although nematode densities were lower at
   10-20 than 0-10 cm, nematode community characteristics were generally
   similar between soil depths. Changes in nematode community and trophic
   structure described here could influence biogeochemical processes,

Abstract = {{Increased mortality of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and spreading of
   deciduous trees are observed in the Swiss Rhone valley. Previous
   research identified climate change effects as main drivers of this
   trend. On the local scale, we hypothesize that legacies from past
   anthropogenic disturbances are superimposed on climate effects.
   We reconstructed land-use history and quantified changes in tree species
   composition from 1930 to 1994 on 9468 ha of forested land. The aim was
   to analyze the contribution of anthropogenic disturbances to the
   observed changes and to disentangle human impact from climate change
   effects.
   At altitudes below 1 200 m a.s.l. we found a shift from pine (-11.4\%)
   to deciduous trees (+11\%) with significantly lower increase of
   deciduous trees in stands formerly used for grazing and/or litter
   collecting. Conversely, pine decrease was not correlated with former
   anthropogenic disturbances. We interpret pine mortality as an effect of
   increased drought stress due to climate change while spread of deciduous
   trees is driven by land-use change. Grazing and litter collecting
   hindered deciduous tree regeneration and it was not until their
   abandonment a few decades ago that forest composition started to change.
   At higher elevations the shift from Norway spruce (Picea abies; -8.5\%)
   to European larch (Larix decidua; +8.2\%) corresponds to silvicultural
   management schemes, aimed at promoting larch recruitment.
   Our study illustrates the importance of disentangling climate from
   land-use change effects for understanding shifts in forest composition.
   The findings are relevant for other regions in the European Alps where

Abstract = {{Question: How have species richness and vegetation patterns changed in a
   group of islands in the northern Baltic Sea over a 58-yr period of
   changing land use and increasing eutrophication?
   Location: A group of 116 islands, the Brunskar subarchipelago, in SW
   Finland.
   Methods: A complete survey of vascular plant species performed in
   1947-1949 by Skult was repeated by our group using the same methodology
   in 2005-2007 (historical versus contemporary, respectively). DCAs were
   performed and total number of species, extinction-colonization rates,
   species frequency changes and mean Ellenberg indicator values for light,
   moisture and nitrogen and Eklund indicator values for dependence of
   human cultural influence were obtained for each island and releve.
   Results: Species richness has declined on large islands and increased on
   small islands. The increase in number of species on small islands is
   driven by a strong increase in frequency of shore species, which in turn
   is induced by more productive shores. The decrease in species richness
   on large islands is related to overgrowth of open semi-natural habitats
   after cessation of grazing and other agricultural practices.
   Conclusions: After the late 1940s, open habitats, which were created and
   maintained by cattle grazing and other traditional agricultural
   activities, have declined in favour of woody shrub and forest land.
   Shores have been stabilized and influenced by the eutrophication of the
   Baltic Sea, and the vegetation has become more homogeneous. This
   development, resulting in lower species diversity, poses a challenge for

Abstract = {{Agro-silvopastoral land-use has a long tradition throughout Europe.
   Depending on the region, wood-pasture occurs as vanishing relic of
   historical land-use, or still more or less widespread as multiple-use
   rangeland. A new development is that former intensively managed land is
   being left to evolve towards wood-pasture as an economically and
   ecologically favourable alternative. In a review of European
   wood-pasture habitats we distinguish 24 types based on the geobotanical
   criteria of region, structure, land-use and tree species composition.
   The European wood-pasture types may be classified as hemi-boreal and
   boreal (4 types), nemoral old-growth (7), nemoral scrub and coppice (5),
   meridional old-growth (2), meridional scrub and coppice (4), and grazed
   orchards (2). Wood-pasture forms part of the cultural heritage of
   Europe, and may add significantly to the preservation of regional
   biodiversity. The role of wood-pasture in ecological restoration
   planning and the possibilities of maintaining or enhancing features of
   wood-pasture deserve more recognition. Many wood-pastures suffer from
   regeneration failure and are over-mature. Other threats to wood-pasture
   include abandonment, intensification, oak disease, overgrazing and
   clearance. In the European Union Habitats Directive, wood-pasture
   habitats are represented but rather inconsistently. We suggest neglected
   woodpasture habitat types to be considered for inclusion. Wood-pasture
   may form an important element for the economic integrity}},

Abstract = {{The outcomes of grasshopper responses to both vertebrate grazing and
   fire vary across grassland ecosystems, and are strongly influenced by
   local climactic factors. Thus, the possible application of grazing and
   fire as components of an ecologically based grasshopper management
   strategy must be investigated in regional studies. In this study, we
   examined the effects of grazing and fire on grasshopper population
   density and community composition in a northern Great Plains mixed-grass
   prairie. We employed a large-scale, replicated, and fully-factorial
   manipulative experimental design across 4 yr to examine the separate and
   interactive effects of three grazing systems in burned and unburned
   habitats. Grasshopper densities were low throughout the 4-yr study and 1
   yr of pretreatment sampling. There was a significant fire by grazing
   `interaction effect on cumulative density and community composition,
   resulting from burned season long grazing pastures having higher
   densities than unburned pastures. Shannon diversity and grasshopper
   species richness were significantly higher with twice-over rotational
   livestock grazing. The ability to draw strong conclusions regarding the
   nature of species composition shifts and population changes in the
   presence of fire and grazing is complicated by the large site
   differences and low grasshopper densities. The results reinforce the
   importance of long-term research to examine the effects of habitat
   manipulation on grasshopper population dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Biofuels have lately been indicated as a promising source of cheap and
   sustainable energy. In this paper we argue that some important ethical
   and environmental issues have also to be addressed: (1) the conflict
   between biofuels production and global food security, particularly in
   developing countries, and (2) the limits of the Human Appropriation of
   ecosystem services and Net Primary Productivity. We warn that large
   scale conversion of crops, grasslands, natural and semi-natural
   ecosystem, (such as the conversion of grasslands to cellulosic ethanol
   production, or plantation of sugar cane and palm oil), may have
   detrimental social and ecological consequences. Social effects may
   concern: (1) food security, especially in developing countries, leading
   to an increase of the price of staple food, (2) transnational
   corporations and big landowners establishing larger and larger
   landholdings in conflict with indigenous areas and the subsistence of
   small farmers. Ecological effects may concern: (1) competition with
   grazing wild and domesticated animals (e.g., millions of grazing
   livestock in USA prairies), (2) an excessive appropriation of Net
   Primary Production from ecosystems, (3) threatening biodiversity
   preservation and soil fertility. We claim that is it well known how
   ecological and social issues are strictly interwoven and that large
   scale biofuels production, by putting high pressure on both fronts, may
   trigger dangerous feedbacks, also considering the critical fact that 9
   billion people are expected to inhabit the planet by 2050. There is a
   need to conduct serious and deep analysis on the environmental and
   social impact of large scale biofuels production before important energy
   policies are launched at global level. Biofuels will not represent an
   energetic panacea and their role in the overall energy consumption will
   remain marginal in our present highly energivorous society, while their
   effect on food security and environment preservation may have
   detrimental results. We should also have the courage to face two key
   issues: (1) we cannot keep increasing resources consumption at present
   pace, and have to change our life style accordingly, and (2) we have to
   deal with population growth; we cannot expect to have 9-10 billions
   people inhabiting the earth by 2050, without this representing a major
   impact on its support system.}},

Abstract = {{The application of lime or liming materials to acid-soil grasslands
   might help mitigate soil acidity, a major constraint to forage
   productivity in many temperate mountainous grasslands. Nowadays, in
   these mountainous grasslands, it is essential to promote agricultural
   practices to increase forage yield and nutritive value while preserving
   biodiversity and agroecosystem functioning. Two different field
   experiments were conducted in the Gorbeia Natural Park, northern Spain:
   (i) one in a calcareous mountainous grassland (Arraba) and (ii) the
   other in a siliceous mountainous grassland (Kurtzegan) to study the
   effects of a single application of two liming products, i.e. 2429 kg
   lime (164.3\% CaCO3) ha(-1) and 4734 kg calcareous sand (84.3\% CaCO3)
   ha(-1), applied one month before the beginning of the sheep grazing
   season (May October), on soil chemical (pH, organic C, total N, C/N
   ratio, \%Al saturation, Olsen P. exchangeable K+ and Ca2+) and
   biological parameters (dehydrogenase, beta-glucosidase, urease, acid
   phosphatase and arylsulphatase activity) as well as on botanical
   diversity (graminoids, forbs, shrubs) and forage yield and nutritive
   value (crude protein, modified acid detergent fibre, digestibility).
   Untreated control plots were also included in the experiment. Soil
   sampling was carried out at the end of the sheep grazing season (6
   months after liming treatment), while botanical composition was
   determined one year after treatments application. Although no increase
   in soil pH was observed in Arraba, liming significantly increased
   dehydrogenase activity (an indicator of soil microbial activity) by 30.4
   and 86.7\% at Arraba and Kurtzegan site, respectively. Liming treatments
   significantly improved forage yield and nutritive value in Arraba but
   not in Kurtzegan. Furthermore, no differences in soil biological
   quality, evaluated using the ``treated-soil quality index{''} as
   proposed in this work, were observed between treated and untreated
   soils, and between the two different lime treatments (lime, calcareous
   sand). It was concluded that, in acid-soil temperate mountainous
   grasslands, moderate liming treatments have no negative short-term
   effects either on soil quality or botanical composition, while resulting
   in improvements in forage yield and nutritive value under some
   conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{965-978}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Question
   (i) How does former land use and land use intensity affect seed bank
   development during post-agricultural succession? (ii) How does time
   since the last clear-cut change seed bank composition during
   post-clear-cut succession?
   Methods
   One data set was compiled per succession type using the following
   selection criteria: (i) the data set included a successional series,
   (ii) plots were located in mesotrophic forest plant communities and
   (iii) vegetation data were available. The post-agricultural succession
   data set comprised 76 recent forest plots (eight studies); the
   post-clear-cut succession data set comprised 218 ancient forest plots
   (three studies). Each data set was analysed separately using either
   linear mixed models or generalized linear models, controlling for both
   environmental heterogeneity and variation between study locations.
   Results
   In the post-agricultural succession data set, land use and time
   significantly affected nearly all the studied seed bank characteristics.
   Seed banks on former arable land recovered poorly even after 150 year of
   restored forest cover, whereas moderate land use intensities
   (grasslands, heathlands) yielded more rapid seed bank recovery. Time was
   a significant determinant of all but two soil seed bank characteristics
   during post-clear-cut succession. Seed banks in managed ancient forest
   differed strongly in their characteristics compared to primary forest
   seed banks.
   Conclusions
   Forest seed banks bear the marks of former land use and/or forest
   management and continue to do so for at least 150 years. Nevertheless,
   time since the last major disturbance, being either former land use or
   clear-cutting, remains a significant determinant of the seed bank.}},

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{119}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{When multiple stressors act simultaneously, their effects on ecosystems
   become more difficult to predict. In the face of multiple stressors,
   diverse ecosystems may be more stable if species respond differently to
   stressors or if functionally similar species can compensate for stressor
   effects on focal species. Many habitats around the globe are threatened
   by multiple stressors, including highly productive seagrass habitats.
   For example, in Chesapeake Bay, USA, regional climate change predictions
   suggest that elevated temperature and freshwater inputs are likely to be
   increasingly important stressors. Using seagrass mesocosms as a model
   system, we tested whether species richness of crustacean grazers buffers
   ecosystem properties against the impacts of elevated temperature and
   freshwater pulse stressors in a fully factorial experiment. Grazer
   species responded to pulsed salinity changes differently; abundance of
   Elasmopus levis responded negatively to freshwater pulses, whereas
   abundance of Gammarus mucronatus and Erichsonella attenuata responded
   positively or neutrally. Consistent with the hypothesis that
   biodiversity provides resistance stability, biomass of epiphytic algae
   that form the base of the food web was less affected by stressors in
   species-rich grazer treatments than in single-species grazer treatments.
   Stochastic (among-replicate) variation of sessile invertebrate biomass
   within treatments was also reduced in more diverse grazer treatments.
   Therefore, grazer species richness tended to increase the resistance
   stability of both major components of the seagrass fouling community,
   algae and invertebrates, in the face of environmental stressors.
   Finally, in our model system, multi-stressor impacts suggested a pattern
   of antagonism contrary to previous assumptions of synergistic stressor
   effects. Overall, our results confirm that invertebrate grazer species
   are functionally diverse in their response to environmental stressors,
   but are largely functionally redundant in their grazing effects leading
   to greater resistance stability of certain ecosystem properties in
   diverse grazer assemblages even when influenced by multiple
   environmental stressors.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland ecosystems evolved with natural disturbance events on multiple
   spatial scales in which focal, fine-scale soil disturbance by animals
   often was imbedded within large-scale grazing disturbance. The resulting
   plant communities adapted to both broad-scale and fine-scale disturbance
   that resulted in species-rich plant communities. These natural
   disturbance regimes have been largely replaced by anthropogenic
   disturbance. While we generally understand grassland response to modern
   grazing practices, we know much less about plant community response to
   soil disturbance imbedded within non-focal grazing. Therefore, we used a
   tracked vehicle to focally disturb soil in a North American mesic mixed
   prairie that was either undisturbed prairie or prairie with a recent
   history of disturbance from either grazing or haying. Successional
   trajectory and recovery time following focal soil disturbance was
   similar between grazed and hayed plant communities. Species composition
   did not differ (P < 0.05) between grazed or hayed prairie and the
   respective undisturbed prairie. Plant species richness and bare ground
   increased (P < 0.05) following focal soil disturbance in both grazed and
   hayed communities, but focal soil disturbance combined with either
   grazing or haying did not change either plant species richness or bare
   ground more than (P > 0.05) focal soil disturbance alone. Also, the
   effect of focal soil disturbance was shortlived with recovery in two
   growing seasons. Our results suggest that anthropogenic focal soil
   disturbance is a reasonable mechanism to restore soil disturbance to the
   grassland ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{In the internal French Alps, subalpine grasslands become dominated by
   the tussock grass, Festuca paniculata, when mowing ceases. Does litter
   or living plants affect seedling recruitment in these subalpine
   communities, and does this vary between mown and unmown grasslands? Can
   the vegetation patterns observed in the field be related to the effects
   of F. paniculata ? These hypotheses were tested using both a field and
   pot experiment. Seedlings of Bromus erectus, a subordinate species in
   these grasslands, were used as phytometers in both experiments. At both
   mown and unmown subalpine grassland sites in the French Alps, a removal
   experiment was established. This field experiment included removal of
   litter and living vegetation in order to differentiate their respective
   effect on seedling establishment. Vegetation and litter had contrasting
   effects. Vegetation affected the recruitment success of B. erectus by
   limiting seedling growth at the mown site and survival at the unmown
   site. Litter modified recruitment only at the unmown site, where it
   increased survival but limited growth. Survival and growth of seedlings
   responded to different environmental factors. Survival was determined
   more by soil moisture, while growth probably depended more on light
   availability. Where there is a thick litter layer, as is the case in
   unmown subalpine grasslands, the competitive effect of vegetation can be
   counterbalanced by an increase in soil moisture due to the litter
   reducing rate of evaporation of water. The effect on seedlings of the
   presence of Festuca paniculata, the dominant species at these sites, was
   also quantified using a pot experiment, including a cutting treatment.
   This experiment showed that the competitive effect of the vegetation
   could be largely explained by the inhibitory effect on growth of the
   dominant species, F. paniculata. This study provides a better
   understanding of the processes that result in conservative plants, such
   as E paniculata, becoming dominant in these subalpine environments upon
   cessation of traditional management practices.}},

   the necessary forage stores in this semi-mountainous region. This type
   of practice was fairly widespread in Europe and is mentioned in the

   a positive diversity - productivity relationship, the role of soil
   animals has been largely neglected. Nematodes are among the most
   widespread and important herbivores causing substantial yield losses in
   agriculture; however, impacts of nematodes on the diversity -
   productivity relationship in semi-natural plant communities have not
   been investigated until today.
   In the framework of the Jena Experiment (Thuringia, Germany) we
   established control and nematicide treated subplots to manipulate
   nematode densities on plots varying in plant species (1-16) and
   functional group richness (1-4). We explored the interacting effects of
   nematicide application and plant diversity on the main trophic groups of
   nematodes and on aboveground plant productivity.
   Nematicide application reduced the number of nematodes significantly,
   particularly that of plant feeders and predators. The negative impact of
   nematicide application on plant and bacterial feeders depended however
   on the diversity of the plant community. Total plant shoot biomass
   tended to decrease in the presence of ambient nematode densities. In
   detail, nematode effects varied however with plant functional group
   identity by reducing only the shoot biomass of herbs significantly but
   not that of legumes. Furthermore, the shoot biomass of grasses tended to
   decrease in the presence of ambient nematode densities. In contrast to
   total shoot biomass, nematodes decreased grass shoot biomass only in
   high diverse but not in low diverse plant communities. Thus, the present
   study for the first time highlights that nematodes likely modify the
   community structure und functions of semi-natural plant communities by
   altering the competition between plant functional groups and by
   attenuating the diversity - productivity relationship. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Metapopulation theory predicts the occurrence of animals in habitat
   patches. In this paper, we tested predictions based on this theory,
   including effects of spatial autocorrelation, to describe factors
   affecting the presence, local number of individuals and density of the
   Marbled White butterfly Melanargia galathea in habitat patches spread
   across the agricultural landscape of southern Poland. This agricultural
   landscape has undergone significant changes in recent decades due to the
   country's political transformation and is currently characterized by a
   large proportion of fallow (abandoned) land. We compared 48 occupied
   habitat patches with 60 unoccupied ones. Positive spatial
   autocorrelation was found in the number and density of individuals in
   habitat patches. The probability of patch occupancy was higher for
   patches that were larger, had a higher proportion of edges, were located
   closer to the nearest neighbouring local population and to the nearest
   piece of fallow, contained a smaller area of cut grass, and also had
   more nectar resources. The number of Marbled Whites in habitat patches
   was positively related to the patch area, the distance to the nearest
   fallow and the abundance of nectar resources, but was negatively related
   to the density of shrubs. The density of individuals was positively
   related to abundance of flowers, proportion of edge in a patch and
   distance to the nearest fallow, but it was negatively related to patch
   area, vegetation height and grass cover. These results indicate that
   recent land-use changes in agricultural landscapes have had both
   positive and negative effects on the presence and local number of
   individuals and density of the Marbled White. These changes affect the
   metapopulation of the species through changes in habitat quality and
   landscape connectivity in the area surrounding habitat patches. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{The underlying causes of change in geographic range size are less well
   understood in African birds than in north temperate species. Here, we
   examine factors associated with range expansion in the Karamoja apalis
   (Apalis karamojae), a globally Vulnerable warbler confined to north-east
   Uganda, north-central Tanzania and southern Kenya. In Tanzania, it was
   originally known only from the Wembere Steppe, but since 1993 (and
   possibly as early as 1983) has extended its range into the Serengeti
   ecosystem, c. 140 km to the north, reaching southern Kenya by 2004.
   Changes in the warbler's range within the Serengeti have broadly
   reflected a cyclical change in the density of its main habitat, Acacia
   drepanolobium woodland, which was low in the 1970s, high during the
   1980s and 1990s, and declined in the early 2000s. Karamoja apalis
   records in the Serengeti showed a 5 year time lag behind A.
   drepanolobium density, which was in turn negatively correlated with the
   area of grassland burnt 10 years earlier. Previous studies in the
   Serengeti have also linked Acacia regeneration to changes in grazing
   pressure, as increasing wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) numbers have
   reduced the volume of combustible material present, and hence the
   frequency of damaging `hot burns'. We conclude that this globally
   threatened warbler appears to have benefited from changes in ungulate
   populations in the Serengeti, which have influenced burning intensity
   and hence tree regeneration. The warbler's range now appears to be
   declining, however, following a recent reduction in the density and
   annual survival of A. drepanolobium in the northern Serengeti.Resume
   Les causes sous-jacentes du changement de la taille d'une distribution
   geographique sont moins bien connues pour les oiseaux africains que pour
   les especes du nord tempere. Nous examinons ici des facteurs lies a
   l'expansion de l'aire de repartition de l'apalis de Karamoja Apalis
   karamojae, un sylviide classe comme Vulnerable au niveau mondial,
   confine au NE de l'Ouganda, au centre-nord de la Tanzanie et au sud du
   Kenya. En Tanzanie, on ne le connaissait a l'origine que dans la steppe
   de Wembere mais depuis 1993, et peut-etre meme des 1983, il a etendu son
   aire de repartition dans l'ecosysteme du Serengeti, environ 140 km plus
   au nord, et atteint le sud du Kenya en 2004. Les changements de l'aire
   de repartition de ce sylviide dans le Serengeti refletent largement un
   changement cyclique de la densite de son habitat principal, la foret
   d'Acacia drepanolobium, qui etait faible dans les annees 1970, forte
   pendant les annees 1980 et 1990, et qui a diminue au debut des annees
   2000. Les rapports sur l'apalis de Karamoja au Serengeti montrent un
   retard de cinq ans par rapport a l'evolution de la densite d'A.
   drepanolobium, elle-meme etant negativement liee a la zone de prairie
   brulee 10 ans plus tot. Des etudes anterieures faites au Serengeti lient
   aussi la regeneration des acacias aux changements de la pression du
   paturage, etant donne que le nombre croissant de gnous, Connochaetes
   taurinus, a reduit le volume des matieres combustibles restantes et donc
   la frequence des feux trop chauds qui causent beaucoup de degats. Nous
   concluons que cet oiseau menace au niveau mondial semble avoir beneficie
   des changements des populations d'ongules au Serengeti, qui ont
   influence l'intensite des feux et donc la regeneration des arbres.
   L'aire de repartition de ce sylviide semble pourtant en train de se
   reduire suite a une recente reduction de la densite et de la survie

Abstract = {{Managing ecosystems to ensure the provision of multiple ecosystem
   services is a key challenge for applied ecology. Functional traits are
   receiving increasing attention as the main ecological attributes by
   which different organisms and biological communities influence ecosystem
   services through their effects on underlying ecosystem processes. Here
   we synthesize concepts and empirical evidence on linkages between
   functional traits and ecosystem services across different trophic
   levels. Most of the 247 studies reviewed considered plants and soil
   invertebrates, but quantitative trait-service associations have been
   documented for a range of organisms and ecosystems, illustrating the
   wide applicability of the trait approach. Within each trophic level,
   specific processes are affected by a combination of traits while
   particular key traits are simultaneously involved in the control of
   multiple processes. These multiple associations between traits and
   ecosystem processes can help to identify predictable trait-service
   clusters that depend on several trophic levels, such as clusters of
   traits of plants and soil organisms that underlie nutrient cycling,
   herbivory, and fodder and fibre production. We propose that the
   assessment of trait-service clusters will represent a crucial step in
   ecosystem service monitoring and in balancing the delivery of multiple,

Abstract = {{Loss of semi-natural grasslands and reduction of habitat diversity are
   considered major potential threats to arthropod diversity in
   agricultural landscapes. The main aim of this study was to investigate
   how area and habitat diversity, mediated by shrub encroachment after
   grassland abandonment, affect species richness of orthopterans in
   island-like grasslands, and how contrasting mobility might alter species
   richness response to both factors. We selected 35 isolated patches in
   landscapes dominated by arable land (durum wheat) in order to obtain two
   statistically uncorrelated gradients: (i) one in habitat area ranging
   from 0.2 to 55 ha and (ii) one in habitat diversity ranging from patches
   dominated by one habitat (either open grasslands or shrublands) to
   patches with a mosaic of different habitats. Habitat loss due to
   land-use conversion into arable fields was associated with a substantial
   loss of species with a positive species-area relationship (SAR), with
   sedentary species having a steeper and stronger SAR than mobile species.
   Halting habitat loss is, therefore, needed to avoid further species
   extinctions. Shrub encroachment, triggered by abandonment, presented a
   hump-shaped relationship with habitat diversity. An increase in habitat
   diversity enhanced species richness irrespective of patch area and
   mobility. Maintaining or enhancing habitat diversity, by cutting or
   burning small sectors and by reintroducing extensive sheep grazing into
   abandoned grassland, are suggested as complementary strategies to
   mitigate further decline of orthopteran diversity in the remnant
   patches. This would be equally important in both small and large
   patches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   composition of the vegetation, which differed between the 2 types of
   pools, and in the lower species richness and abundance of plant species
   in the grazed pools. These differences are interpreted as resulting from
   the selection by herbivores and the differential tolerance of species to

Abstract = {{The effect of industrial pollution on soil free-living nematode
   communities, trophic groups, and taxon composition was investigated
   along an 18-km transect that included the Angren power plant, a

   collected in May 2005 and October 2006 from the upper (0-10 and 10-20
   cm) soil layers in downwind directions from the industrial complex
   emission sources of the Angren industrial sites.
   Direct and indirect (through soil property changes), separate and
   integrated effects of industrial pollution and livestock activity on the
   soil nematode community were found. The total number of nematodes was
   found to be negatively correlated with the amounts of chemical elements
   in soil and positively correlated with the calcium concentration in
   soil. The nematode communities, trophic diversity, and taxon composition
   were found to be affected by the variety and concentration of chemical
   elements.
   The widely used ecological indices applied in the present research were
   sensitive to environmental disturbances caused by industrial pollution
   as well as livestock activity. The Wasilewska index, nematode channel
   ratio, and maturity index were mostly affected by trace metal
   concentration, while the diversity indices and species richness were
   mostly affected by soil property changes. The nematode channel ratio
   indicated that the bacterial-based decomposition process was dominant in
   soils exposed to both strong industrial pollution and livestock
   activity. The diversity indices indicated the disappearance of rare
   species in the industrial area and an increase of the contribution of
   common nematodes with increasing depth and distance from the unfavorable
   area. The current study confirmed that the grazing in accompaniment to
   industrial pollution, intensify a negative effect on soil nematode

Abstract = {{Proposed links between biodiversity and ecosystem processes have

   In a context of environmental change (that is, land-use and climate)
   long-term studies of ANPP and functional groups are gaining interest.
   However, rapid determination of ANPP and functional groups are often

   relieve constraints of labor intensive hand-sorting by providing quick,

Abstract = {{The present study consisted of an evaluation of assemblages of epigeic
   carabid beetles (Col. Carabidae) colonizing hydrogenic soils (bog and
   post-bog ones), different in the soil development degree. The
   observations were conducted on a drained, low bog area called Stary
   Dwor, which today is used as a cut meadow. This is an oblong depression,
   filled in with (partly mucky) rush peats and situated in the sandur
   landscape. It lies in the mesoregion called Pojezierze Olsztynskie
   (Olsztyn Lake District) near Olsztyn (UTM DE 65), about 3 km of the
   southern borders of the town. The field observations for determination
   of the soil type were conducted using soil catenas. A transect was
   established, which cut across different types and sub-types of bog and
   post-bog soils. In this paper, the authors have attempted to answer the
   question whether the sequence of hydrogenic soils and some parameters
   chosen to describe them have any influence on assemblages of epigeic
   carabid beetles dwelling in such habitats. Based on the results, it has
   been concluded that the soils present in the analyzed peat bog were
   characterized by the following sequence: muckous soils -> peat-muck
   soils -> peat soils. Their properties depended on the position in the
   soil relief, advancement of muck formation and content of organic
   carbon. It has been found out that the highest soil ash content in the

   profile 3 of peat-muck soil (18.77\%). The reaction of the analyzed
   soils ranged from slightly acidic to neutral and tended to decrease
   towards the centre of the depression, reaching the lowest value in peat
   soil. During the two years of our observations, a total of 673
   individuals of Carabidae belonging to 29 species were captured. It has
   been determined that the type of soil as a factor significantly affected
   the number of captured carabid beetles, but did not influence the

   content of organic C were associated with a decreasing number of the
   species of carabid beeetles tolerant to moisture conditions (mesophilous
   species), which were being replaced by hygrophilous individuals. As the
   acidic reaction of soil increased and the soil content of organic matter
   rose, so did the abundance of mixophagous species at the expense of

Abstract = {{Dictyostelid cellular slime molds (dictyostelids) associated with

   dictyostelids. For each of those six sites with well developed gallery
   forests present, an additional set of forest soil/humus samples was
   collected. A more intensive sampling effort was carried out at one site
   (Konza LTER) to assess the possible effects of burning and grazing on
   dictyostelid diversity and density. Twelve species of dictyostelids were
   recovered from grassland sites, whereas gallery forest sites yielded
   only nine species. Four cosmopolitan species (Dictyostelium giganteum,
   D. mucoroides, D. sphaerocephalum and Polysphondylium pallidum) were
   represented by the greatest densities of clones, with D. sphaerocephalum

Abstract = {{The Rainwater Basin region in Nebraska is critically important stopover
   habitat for spring waterfowl migrations, but the ability of these sites
   to produce sufficient food for migrating waterfowl is endangered by the
   invasion of reed canarygrass (Phalaris arundinacea L.). This species
   produces thick litter layers and abundant aboveground biomass, reducing
   germination and seedling survival of the annual plant species
   responsible for much of the seed production in the area. Cattle grazing
   often is used as a management tool in the Rainwater Basin to slow or
   reverse reed canarygrass invasion and to improve growing conditions for
   more desirable plant species. However, there has been little research on
   the impact of grazing on these factors. We studied the impacts of
   one-time, early-season (between April and June) cattle grazing on the
   abundance of reed canarygrass, bare ground, and litter. We hypothesized
   that cattle grazing would result in reduced reed canarygrass by the end
   of the 2-yr study, and that grazing would increase the abundance of bare
   ground and decrease the abundance of litter. Because grazing was
   expected to improve conditions for seed germination, we expected to find
   higher species richness in grazed areas. We found that grazing did not
   reduce the abundance of reed canarygrass, but the application of
   early-season grazing for two consecutive years did reduce litter and
   increase bare ground. Litter abundance decreased by 7.5\% in ungrazed
   plots and litter increased by 8.6\% in grazed plots. Bare ground in
   grazed plots increased 10.7\% in grazed plots but decreased 1.2\% in
   ungrazed plots. Species richness was not affected by grazing during this
   study. We concluded that grazing, as utilized in this study, is not
   sufficient to reduce reed canarygrass abundance, but can be used to
   mitigate some of the negative impacts of reed canarygrass invasion.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and anthropogenic disturbance provides a mechanism for resetting
   the species assemblage within natural communities. Following
   anthropogenic disturbance particularly, there are generally more weedy
   species. Restoration of ecosystem structure and function in disturbed
   areas could aid in the control of these undesirable species. Attempts to
   re-establish vegetation via direct sowing, hydroseeding, drill seeding,
   imprinting or plugging of either native or non-native species can be
   effective, but can result in increased erosion and weed proliferation
   prior to desirable cover of the intended species. The use of native
   species for rehabilitation can be preferable because non-native species
   are often less suited to the local environment and can pose a threat to
   the integrity of adjacent ecosystems. Native multispecies sod could
   become a useful rehabilitation tool, but research is needed to determine
   which species to use and the appropriate number of species to include.
   Mixtures of 4-7 native species were grown for 7 months, and clipped dry
   biomass, species percent abundance, and total ground cover were assessed

   sod production. Despite differences between mixtures at some harvests,
   all mixtures established and produced similar biomass by the end of the

   Differences in total ground cover between mixtures were explained by the

Abstract = {{Temperate grasslands of Argentina are extensively grazed by domestic
   livestock. Primary production follows a seasonal pattern, with maximum
   vegetation growth in late spring and minimum in winter. During the last
   decade, winter forage productivity has been encouraged by promoting the
   growth of cool-season annual grasses through late summer applications of
   glyphosate. The aim of this study was to describe structural changes in
   grassland vegetation associated with glyphosate treatments, as applied
   in a commercial livestock farm in the Flooding Pampa. Vegetation
   composition was assessed from spring 2006 to late summer 2008, in three
   paddocks that had never been exposed to any kind of herbicide, and three
   other paddocks treated with glyphosate in late summer in the previous 5
   years. In the paddocks treated with glyphosate, basal cover of
   cool-season annual grasses and forage value in spring were greater but
   basal cover of cool-season perennial grasses, warm-season tussock
   grasses, warm-season legumes, total basal vegetation cover and forage
   value in summer were much lower respect to untreated paddocks. The shift
   in floristic composition resulted in less rich and even assemblages,
   dominated by an annual species and impoverished in native and perennial
   species. These structural changes may alter ecosystem processes through
   the increase of soil salinization and water losses in summer, may affect
   the seasonal pattern of productivity and may threaten biodiversity
   conservation and sustainability of wild life. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Spatial heterogeneities of vegetation and soil can strongly affect
   ecological functions of ecosystems, particularly for arid and semi-arid
   ecosystems where vegetation has a patchy distribution and livestock
   grazing is one of the major land use types. However, little is known
   about the impact of grazing on spatial patterns of vegetation and soil,
   even though grazing has variously been shown to create, maintain or
   destroy those patterns. We studied how grazing intensity affected the
   spatial patterns of vegetation and soil fertility at scales ranging from
   0.1 to 18.7 m in a desert steppe in Inner Mongolia, China. Increasing
   grazing intensity decreased the range of spatial autocorrelation of
   plant aboveground biomass at the fine scale (<2 m), indicating that
   vegetation patches were more fragmented under higher grazing pressure.
   Spatial heterogeneity of soil water content and organic C concentration
   decreased along the gradient of increasing grazing intensity at the fine
   scale. Light grazing increased soil NH4+ availability and its overall
   variability. Soil NO3- only had significant cross-correlation with
   aboveground biomass in un-grazed plots at the fine scale, suggesting
   that the spatial correlation between plant and soil fertility was
   affected by grazing. Spatial patterns of studied variables did not
   respond to grazing intensities at a coarse scale (1-18 m). Our results
   demonstrated that the grazing intensity altered fine scale processes in
   this desert steppe and caused divergent responses of spatial
   distribution of vegetation and soil fertility. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Voles of the genera Microtus and Myodes feed on tree seedlings planted
   on cutover forest land in temperate and boreal forests of North America
   and Eurasia. This damage may have serious economic implications as well
   as limit regeneration of appropriate tree species in certain forest
   ecosystems. Prediction of vole population outbreaks and feeding damage
   to forest plantations, across even a limited geographic range, has yet
   to be achieved in North America. Thus, a major objective was a detailed
   analysis of changes in population dynamics of long-tailed voles
   (Microtus longicaudus), and to test three hypotheses (H) that vole
   populations would: (H(1)) rise and fall in accordance with the abundance
   of herbaceous plants (grasses and forbs) during early vegetative
   succession after forest harvesting, (H(2)) be positively associated with
   grass-seeded sites; and (H(3)) incidence of feeding damage to seedlings
   would be positively associated with vole abundance. Voles were
   live-trapped for 6 years (2004-2009) from the time of harvesting on
   intensive sites, as well as surveyed over a range of extensive sites.
   Population numbers were related to habitat characteristics and tree
   damage in young forest plantations near Golden, British Columbia,
   Canada.
   Populations of long-tailed voles were low in the first two years after
   harvest with mean numbers <5-15/ha. Annual peaks of 49-84 voles/ha were
   recorded in 2006. In the fourth year (2007) after harvesting, numbers of
   voles declined on two of three sites, deepened in 2008 and reached
   extirpation in 2009. On the extensive sites, vole numbers increased
   4.6-5.3 times from 1-2 to 3-6 years post-harvest before declining
   thereafter. Crown volume index of grasses and herbs, volume and
   abundance of downed wood, total species richness of vascular plants, and
   structural diversity of herbs were important habitat variables. Vole
   numbers were higher on those sites seeded with pasture grasses and
   forbs. There was a significant positive relationship of tree mortality
   and abundance of voles (Microtus) across a relatively wide geographic
   area.
   This study is the first relatively long-term analysis of changes in
   population dynamics of the long-tailed vole and the predictions of H1
   and H2 seemed to be supported. The positive relationship (H3) of the
   incidence of overwinter damage to trees and vole abundance is the first
   such analysis for forest plantations, on harvested sites, in North
   America. At 3-4 years post-clearcut harvesting is a critical time for
   population buildups of voles and subsequent damage to plantation trees.
   Seeded grass species clearly create optimum habitat conditions for
   voles, generating population densities up to 30-50 voles/ha, which is in
   the range of a ``high{''} damage risk to seedlings. Risk ratings
   (voles/ha) for feeding damage to trees were low (<7), moderate (7-34),
   high (35-88), and very high (>88). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The consequences of plant species loss are rarely assessed in a
   multi-trophic context and especially effects on life-history traits of
   organisms at higher trophic levels have remained largely unstudied. We
   used a grassland biodiversity experiment and measured the effects of two
   components of plant diversity, plant species richness and the presence
   of nitrogen-fixing legumes, on several life-history traits of naturally
   colonizing aphids and their primary and secondary parasitoids in the
   field. We found that, irrespective of aphid species identity, the
   proportion of winged aphid morphs decreased with increasing plant
   species richness, which was correlated with decreasing host plant
   biomass. Similarly, emergence proportions of parasitoids decreased with
   increasing plant species richness. Both, emergence proportions and
   proportions of female parasitoids were lower in plots with legumes,
   where host plants had increased nitrogen concentrations. This effect of
   legume presence could indicate that aphids were better defended against
   parasitoids in high-nitrogen environments. Body mass of emerged
   individuals of the two most abundant primary parasitoid species was,
   however, higher in plots with legumes, suggesting that once parasitoids
   could overcome aphid defenses, they could profit from larger or more
   nutritious hosts. Our study demonstrates that cascading effects of plant
   species loss on higher trophic levels such as aphids, parasitoids and
   secondary parasitoids begin with changed life-history traits of these
   insects. Thus, life-history traits of organisms at higher trophic levels
   may be useful indicators of bottom-up effects of plant diversity on the

Abstract = {{Question
   Is there any effect of cutting frequency and liming on P and K
   availability in the soil, biomass production and plant species
   composition after cessation of fertilizer application?
   Location
   Eifel Mountains, SW Germany.
   Methods
   The long-term Grassland Extensification and Nutrient Depletion
   Experiment was established on a fertilized and mown pasture
   (Lolio-Cynosuretum) in 1993. Treatments were: (1) two cuts per year
   without liming, (2) two cuts with liming, (3) four cuts without liming,
   (4) four cuts with liming and (5) continued intensive mowing as the
   control.
   Results
   From 1993 to 2006, the plant available P concentration in the soil
   decreased substantially, whereas K concentration decreased only
   slightly. Biomass production decreased from 7 to 5 t DM ha-1. These
   trends were affected by cessation of NPK fertilizer application but not
   by cutting frequency or liming. In 2007, substantial differences in
   species composition between the control and the two-cut and four-cut
   treatments were recorded, whereas liming had no effect. Higher species
   richness was recorded in cut treatments compared to the control, but no
   effects of cutting frequency or liming were observed. Ellenberg
   indicator values indicated that soil nutrients influenced changes in
   species composition only marginally.
   Conclusions
   The decrease in productivity and available soil P and K in favor of
   species richness was not achieved to any greater extent by four cuts
   than by two cuts, or by lime application. Although species richness
   slightly increased, we conclude that the restoration of low productive
   grasslands cannot be achieved by cutting management.}},

   southern Australia are well documented. However, less is known about the
   potential of ecosystems to recover after a long history of stock grazing
   and, in particular, whether the removal of stock will have positive,
   negative or neutral impacts on biodiversity. We examined the response of
   understorey vegetation to the removal of sheep grazing in a herb-rich
   Eucalyptus camaldulensis (red gum) woodland in western Victoria. Using a
   space-for-time chronosequence, woodlands were stratified into groups
   based on their time-since-grazing removal; these were long-ungrazed (>20
   years), intermediate-time-since-grazing (9-14 years), recently ungrazed
   (5 years) and continuously grazed. We found significantly higher species
   density in long-ungrazed sites relative to sites with a more recent
   grazing history. No differences were found in species density between
   continuously grazed sites and those ungrazed in the previous 14 years.
   Species composition differed with time-since-grazing removal and
   indicator species analysis detected several native species (including
   tall native geophytes and herbs) associated with long-ungrazed sites
   that were absent or in low abundance in the more recently grazed sites.
   Seven of the eight species significantly associated with continuously
   grazed sites were exotic. Removal of sheep grazing in red gum woodlands
   can have positive benefits for understorey diversity but it is likely
   that recovery of key indicators such as native species will be slow.}},

Abstract = {{Biological invasions have important ecological impacts at both local and
   global levels, affecting biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and
   economic sustainability. The study of invasions requires specific
   methodological approaches to gain rapid insight into the spatial and
   temporal dynamics of the system. We studied a recent invasion by the
   exotic herb Hieracium pilosella L. (Mouse-ear hawkweed, Asteraceae) in
   the Argentinean portion of the northern part of Tierra del Fuego Island
   in Southern Patagonia. To assess the extent of this invasion and the
   related ecological and land use factors, we performed an extensive field
   sampling at a regional scale and used a spatial pattern approach using
   geostatistical techniques to build a map of the invasion. Our results
   showed that the invading species is widely distributed across the entire
   Fuegian steppe, in general with low cover (< 2\%) and a particular
   spatial structure having hot spots (10-70\%) related to specific land
   uses. We found regional-latitudinal and also local-community level
   variability in the frequency, cover and spatial distribution of the
   invasive species, each of them associated with particular ecological
   factors, and no association with regular domestic animal grazing.
   Region-wide invasion may be accounted for by wind dispersal of the seeds
   and the latitudinal variability of the precipitation; while
   local-variability was associated with the susceptibility of different
   plant communities to invasion. Hot spots were found to be related to
   massive soil disturbances (e.g., road building, shrub removal, physical
   impacts of long-term and intense domestic animal use, etc.), probably
   due to the presence of bare soil favoring colonization by the invading
   species. Scrublands, lawns and grasslands were more invaded than
   wetlands, heathlands or salt grasslands. Since the invasion is
   apparently at initial stages due to the low cover values found, we
   believe that information about the extent and environmental or
   management factors involved in this exotic plant's expansion should be
   used to design appropriate control and mitigation tools. In this sense,
   our results point to management actions focused on reducing the presence
   of hot spots of invasion by means of quick revegetation of bare soil
   after a massive disturbance event takes place.}},

Abstract = {{P>Grazing occurs over a third of the earth's land surface and may
   potentially influence the storage of 109 Mg year-1 of greenhouse gases
   as soil C. Displacement of native herbivores by high densities of
   livestock has often led to overgrazing and soil C loss. However, it
   remains unknown whether matching livestock densities to those of native
   herbivores can yield equivalent soil C sequestration. In the
   Trans-Himalayas we found that, despite comparable grazing intensities,
   watersheds converted to pastoralism had 49\% lower soil C than
   watersheds which retain native herbivores. Experimental grazer-exclusion
   within each watershed type, show that this difference appears to be
   driven by indirect effects of livestock diet selection, leading to
   vegetation shifts that lower plant production and reduce likely soil C
   inputs from vegetation by c. 25 gC m-2 year-1. Our results suggest that
   while accounting for direct impacts (stocking density) is a major step,
   managing indirect impacts on vegetation composition are equally
   important in influencing soil C sequestration in grazing ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{1. Habitat requirements and occurrence patterns of three species of
   burnet moths (Zygaena filipendulae, Zygaena lonicerae and Zygaena
   viciae) were studied at different life stages and different scales on
   the Baltic island of Oland, Sweden.
   2. Larvae of all three species were more likely to occur in small-scale
   patches (i.e. 1 m2) with a greater cover of their most important host
   plants, Lotus corniculatus, Trifolium medium/pratense, or Vicia spp.,
   than were pupae or adults, and were also observed on significantly
   larger than random plants. Pupation of Z. filipendulae took place in
   taller vegetation than preferred by feeding larvae and adults.
   3. Adults of all species preferred different nectar plants of Asteraceae
   and Dipsacaceae, growing in sunny conditions.
   4. A large-scale analysis of occupancy patterns was made, evaluating the
   relationship between burnet occurrence and the area of meadows and
   pastures within 10 x 10 km grid cells in Sweden. All three species
   showed a significant positive relationship with the area of semi-natural
   grassland. The area required for a 50\% probability of burnet occurrence
   was 454 ha for Z. filipendulae, 925 ha for Z. lonicerae and 2055 ha for
   Z. viciae.
   5. Conservation work should aim at preserving and restoring open areas
   rich in the respective host plants and nectar sources, with light
   grazing or mowing late in the season. At the landscape scale, burnet
   moths were favoured by a high density of semi-natural grassland and

Abstract = {{South America is blessed with both world-leading levels of biodiversity,
   and world-record breaking levels of habitat conversion in some areas.
   Under this highly dynamic context, sound conservation planning is needed
   and one component of effectively prioritising conservation interventions
   is through the assessment of threats to natural ecosystems. Here we
   present a continent-wide and spatially explicit threats assessment to
   natural ecosystems. A conceptual framework is presented which quantifies
   threat as a function of both the magnitude of the impacts of specific
   damaging human activities, and the variable response of different
   ecosystems to those impacts. The frame work is then applied on seven
   different threat layers (accessibility, conversion to agriculture,
   fires, grazing pressure, infrastructure, oil and gas, recent conversion)
   to map out and spatially quantify the level of threat expected over the
   coming 2-5 year period. An aggregate threat layer is calculated, and the
   threats to major habitat types are evaluated. Tropical and Subtropical
   Grasslands, Savannas and Shrublands and Flooded Grasslands and Savannas
   are found to be under the greatest threat (0.36 and 0.35 aggregate
   threat respectively), both threatened most by fires (0.96), the former
   by accessibility (0.72) and the latter by grazing pressure (0.62).
   Tropical and Subtropical Moist Broad leaf Forests are the least
   threatened of all ecosystems (0.13), closely followed by Montane
   Grasslands and Shrublands (0.14). Overall, accessibility is shown to be
   a major issue across much of the continent, and fires area significant
   threat in some identified regions. The results are being used by The
   Nature Conservancy to target conservation efforts in the region, and
   also to drive policies for threat abatement. Furthermore, the conceptual
   framework and methodology is applicable to any region and presents a
   useful means of prioritising conservation interventions across broad
   geographic regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological restoration of native woodlands and wooded pastures on former
   agricultural land is an important topic in modern conservation practice.
   The introduction of large herbivores is increasingly used to achieve
   these aims. We investigated how grazing, resistance traits of plants(
   concerning herbivory) and associational resistance interact and affect
   the establishment pattern of woody species on abandoned arable land
   (N-Belgium, W-Europe). In these early successional tree assemblages, we
   tested whether grazing increased or decreased spatial heterogeneity,
   which is supposed to be a crucial factor for biodiversity.
   With repeated measurements, 2-3 and 5-7 years after the cessation of
   agricultural use, we sampled 87 grazed and 56 ungrazed plots (314 m(2))
   in 14 sampling areas (former arable land) on nutrient rich, ( sandy)
   loam soils. We recorded established tree frequencies, related to
   grazing, time, resistance traits and unpalatable/spiny vegetation cover
   in the herb and low shrub layer. We investigated horizontal and vertical
   heterogeneity using variances in establishment frequencies and variances
   in frequencies of trees that were able to grow beyond the browse line,
   respectively.
   We found massive colonisation of grazing tolerant and resistant woody
   species in early successional stages. Grazing decreased frequencies and
   height of the most abundant tolerant species( mainly Salix caprea L.).
   After 5-7 years, frequencies of defensive and tolerant species were
   equal, but the former ( mainly Betula pendula Roth) were able to grow
   beyond the browse line. When the cover of unpalatable/spiny vegetation
   was high enough (460\% of plot size), it also provided suitable nurse
   sites for tolerant species to grow out. In early assemblages, grazing
   increased horizontal and vertical heterogeneity, resulting in
   intermediate successional stages. In the long-term, the mechanism of
   associational resistance will also allow non-resistant and tolerant
   species to grow beyond the browse line and promote forest succession and
   the order of species establishment and replacement. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Title = {{Influence of vegetation clutter on the capacity of ground foraging bats
   to capture prey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{850-858}},

Abstract = {{P>1. The management of the habitat of insectivorous species often
   targets increasing the availability of arthropod prey. However, this may
   be hindered by lack of knowledge of the mechanisms that determine food
   availability for insectivores. Prey abundance is often used as a
   surrogate for availability, but this may be incorrect wherever habitat
   factors limit access to prey. Ground vegetation clutter is likely to be
   such a limiting factor for ground foraging insectivorous bats, and we
   investigated this possibility using Myotis myotis as a model.
   2. We performed captivity experiments to determine how ground vegetation
   density affects foraging. Bats were provided with crickets hidden in
   sparse, medium and dense grass cover. In addition, we used bat radio
   tracking data, prey abundance measurements, and geographic information
   system (GIS) modelling to determine if clutter influences how bats
   select foraging areas in a Mediterranean region.
   3. The experiments demonstrated that ground vegetation clutter greatly
   reduces access to prey, affecting both capture success and time to
   capture. Bats detected prey in the dense vegetation, but did not attempt
   to capture them or did so only after a prolonged delay. Their attempts
   often failed, because the bats landed over prey with open wings,
   presumably to increase the catching surface, and the dense vegetation
   prevented them from reaching the ground.
   4. In the study area, cover types with the densest ground vegetation
   harboured the most prey, but clutter made access to prey by M. myotis
   difficult. Corroborating this, the GIS models showed that bats avoided
   foraging in habitats with high prey abundance but in which availability
   was decreased by dense ground vegetation.
   5. Ungrazed grasslands reach vegetation densities that limit access to
   prey by ground foraging bats, as observed in the study area. However,
   grazing by cattle reduced clutter to levels equivalent to the sparse
   treatment in our captive experiments, in which bats captured prey
   easily.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Conservation of ground foraging bats may
   require the management of their feeding grounds, to increase or maintain
   prey availability, particularly near important colonies. While dense
   ground vegetation may promote prey density, it dramatically reduces
   access to prey and usage by bats; hence, this should be considered by
   managers. Moderate grazing can be used to reduce ground vegetation cover
   to levels that permit foraging by bats.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms linking plant species richness to foraging of a large
   herbivore}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{868-875}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{P>1. There is general concern that local loss of plant diversity will
   adversely impact net primary productivity and other ecosystem
   properties. However, mechanisms linking plant diversity with other
   trophic levels, especially for large herbivores, are poorly understood.
   2. We examine the responses of foraging sheep to changes in plant
   species richness in an indoor cafeteria experiment involving six plant
   species richness levels (1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 11 species) and three plant
   functional group compositions within each level, and in a field
   experiment involving three plant species richness levels (1, 4-6 or > 8
   species).
   3. Sheep preferred a diverse diet over a single diet even when palatable
   species were in the diet. Voluntary daily intake steadily rose with
   increases in plant species richness in both cafeteria and field
   experiments. The overall nutrient intake (i.e. daily energy and protein
   intakes) of sheep in the cafeteria also rose significantly with
   increased plant species richness until it reached a plateau at eight
   species. The quality of the diet selected by sheep was also
   significantly affected by plant species richness, but the variation of
   dietary quality was small and variable.
   4. High nutrient acquisition by the sheep depended on selecting those
   palatable species with high nutrient content from the plant forage on
   offer together with the complementary effects of plant species richness,
   especially for plant functional group richness.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our experiments demonstrate an asymptotic
   relationship between plant species richness and voluntary intake by
   sheep. Increases in plant species richness from a low level led to
   increased daily nutrient intake, and presumably performance of the
   sheep. Natural grasslands are generally low in nutritional quality and
   so plant species richness will critically influence herbivore food
   intake and nutrition. The asymptotic relationship indicates that the
   maintenance of plant species richness in rangelands will benefit both
   domestic herbivore production and the conservation of biodiversity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{876-883}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Vegetation fires can have major social, economic and ecological
   consequences. Research into fire behaviour has aimed to give managers
   greater ability to predict and control fires. Fire and grazing are
   important and interacting disturbances in grasslands. Fire is known to
   widely affect grazing patterns, but the effects of grazing on the
   incidence of fire are less well known. There have been few tests of the
   idea that `grazing reduces blazing', which has popular and political
   currency in some countries. This study addresses the hypothesis that
   grazing affects fire potential in native grasslands.
   2. Paired grazed and ungrazed quadrats were established at five lawn and
   five tussock grassland sites. Fuel load, percentage dead fuel and the
   number of days sustaining fires where possible were compared between
   treatments.
   3. In lawn grasslands, grazing markedly reduced fire potential through
   the removal of plant biomass and by preventing the vegetation escaping
   into the unpalatable and flammable tussock state. Grazing led to
   increased fire potential in tussock grasslands where animals selectively
   removed live shoots, leaving a high proportion of dead fuel.
   4. The difference in flammability responses to grazing between lawn and
   tussock grassland appeared to be due to differences in palatability that
   in turn may relate to soil fertility and the constancy of intense
   grazing. These differences mean that grazing lawns and tussock
   grasslands are likely to be subject to differing disturbance regimes.
   This association between disturbance regime and vegetation structural
   type suggests that lawns and tussock grasslands represent alternative
   stable states within the grassland ecosystem.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Grazing is only likely to reduce the
   probability of fire where the bulk of the vegetation consists of
   potential food for grazing animals. It is likely that the negative
   relationship between vegetation palatability and fire potential applies
   to grasslands generally and possibly to many other vegetation types.
   Grassland managers may need to manipulate disturbance regimes in order
   to maintain vegetation structural heterogeneity and thereby promote
   landscape-scale biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Low-input meadows are now recognized for their high biodiversity value
   and form an integral element of many agri-environmental schemes in
   Europe. Meadow mowing techniques, however, have become highly mechanized
   in recent decades and scientific knowledge on the direct impacts of
   these techniques on field fauna is based on very few and often poorly
   replicated studies. Yet these studies, despite their limitations,
   suggest that such impacts can be considerable. With a view to providing
   a more comprehensive experimental assessment, we evaluated the direct
   impacts of four different mowing techniques (hand motor mower with
   cutter bar, rotary mower cut at 9 cm and rotary mower cut at 6 cm with
   and without a conditioner) on wax invertebrate models and real
   caterpillars. The size of the organisms, their microhabitat, the tractor
   wheel effect and the cutting height were also investigated as factors
   that could potentially affect mowing-caused mortality. Rotary mowers
   were found to be more damaging than motor bar mowers on caterpillars
   (37\% vs. 20\%), but only on one type of invertebrate wax-model.
   Conditioners more than doubled damage to all wax-models in the
   vegetation (in average from 11\% to 30\%) and increased caterpillar
   mortality from 38\% to 69\%. Larger organisms were more vulnerable than
   smaller organisms and ground organisms were strongly impacted by tractor
   wheels. While conditioner should not be used in meadows where
   conservation of the inhabiting fauna is of concern, we also recognize
   that there is no damage-free mowing technique. We therefore advocate the
   importance of leaving uncut areas as a refuge for invertebrates.}},

Title = {{A functional assessment of the response of grassland vegetation to
   reduced grazing and abandonment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{683-694}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Question
   Predicting the impact of land-use change on vegetation is vital to
   understanding how biodiversity and ecosystem function may respond. Is it
   correct to assume that abandonment is an extreme form of grazing
   reduction?
   Location
   Borders and central Scotland.
   Methods
   The analysis used data sets from two identical experiments where the
   impacts of two unfertilized, extensively grazed treatments and one
   unfertilized abandoned treatment were compared against the species
   dynamics of a pasture subject to normal, productive grazing management
   over a 16-year period. Initial multivariate analysis using Principal
   Response Curves was used to assess if particular traits were associated
   with either extensive or abandoned treatments, and was checked using
   univariate tests of individual traits. RLQ analysis followed by
   clustering into response groups was used to assess if species behaved in
   a similar manner between sites.
   Results
   For many traits/attributes the shift in value or proportion was
   approximately linear across the extensification treatments as grazing
   was removed. However, certain traits showed step changes and quadratic
   responses. Leaf dry matter content, an important effect trait, was in
   the latter group. Most traits/attributes and species behaved similarly
   at the two sites. However, traits such as regenerative strategy, seed
   length, longevity and mass and seed bank type behaved differently,
   indicating that they are not predictable response traits.
   Conclusion
   The results indicate that responses to grazing removal during
   extensification are largely straightforward and largely independent of
   species pool. However, there are discrepancies that suggest that simple
   analyses of the impacts of land-use changes such as grazing reduction
   may hide more complex responses.}},

Abstract = {{With well-preserved nature and a geographical location at the border of
   the West Carpathian and the East Carpathian biogeographical regions, the
   Poloniny National Park (NP) ranks among the most valuable areas for
   biodiversity in Slovakia. The territory is a typical region with
   mountain agriculture (12\% of the study area), where grasslands dominate
   in an agricultural landscape. Grasslands became the basis of traditional
   farming many years ago, when extensive agriculture was mainly focused on
   hay production and grazing, representing the lifestyle of the local
   people. This kind of sensitive human management contributed to the
   maintenance of valuable grassland communities and their rich
   biodiversity. In particular, the mountain poloniny meadows are
   characterized by large numbers of rare and threatened East Carpathian
   species. Intensification of agriculture from the 1970s and its decline
   after the massive political and socioeconomic changes of 1989 have
   caused substantial damage to species-rich grasslands in the region.
   Implementation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is now providing
   greater financial support to restart agricultural activities in the
   Poloniny National Park. Nonetheless, there is still concern about
   maintenance of the biodiversity of mountain grassland communities, where
   access is limited, and which require specific extensive management. This
   paper aims to identify the driving forces of agrobiodiversity change and
   the implications for habitats and species, and to predict possible
   future trends in the region. Emerging from the assessment of these
   trends, several recommendations are made regarding appropriate
   management measures for the maintenance of agrobiodiversity together
   with sustainable development in Poloniny National Park.}},

Abstract = {{Plants of low stature may benefit from the presence of large herbivores
   through removal of tall competitive neighbours and increased light
   availability. Accordingly, removal of grazers has been predicted to
   disfavour small species. In addition to this indirect beneficial effect,
   the population dynamics of plants is strongly influenced by variation in
   external conditions such as temperature and precipitation. However, few
   studies have examined the interaction between large herbivores and
   inter-annual variation in climate for the population dynamics of small
   plant species not preferred by herbivores. We studied three populations
   of the perennial herb Viola biflora exposed to different sheep densities
   (high, low and zero) for 6 years in a field experiment. Plants were also
   impacted by invertebrate and small vertebrate herbivores (rodents).
   Rates of growth were marginally higher at high sheep densities, and
   during warm summers both survival and growth were higher when sheep were
   present. Thus, while the height of tall herbs was positively related to
   July temperature, it was less so in the treatments with sheep,
   suggesting that sheep reduce the negative effects of interspecific
   competition for this small herb. Life table response experiment analyses
   revealed that the population growth rate (lambda) was slightly lower in
   the absence of sheep, but between-year variation in lambda was larger
   than variation among sheep density treatments. lambda was negatively
   related to July temperature, with an additional negative effect of
   vertebrate grazing frequency (sheep or rodent grazing). The evidence
   from this 6-year study suggests that the population dynamics of Viola
   biflora is determined by a complex interplay between climate and grazing
   by both large and small herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Anecic earthworms have been shown to collect, concentrate and bury seeds
   in their burrows. Moreover, recent studies suggest that earthworms
   function as granivores and seedling herbivores thereby directly
   impacting plant community assembly. However, this has not been proven
   unequivocally. Further, it remains unclear if earthworms benefit from
   seed ingestion, i.e., if they assimilate seed carbon. We set up a series
   of three laboratory experiments in order to test the following
   hypotheses: (1) anecic earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris L) not only
   ingest seeds but also seedlings, (2) ingestion of seedlings is lower
   than that of seeds due to a `size refuge' of seedlings (i.e., they are
   too big to be swallowed), and (3) seeds and seedlings contribute to
   earthworm nutrition. L terrestris readily consumed legume seedlings in
   the radicle stage, whereas legume seeds and seedlings in the cotyledon
   stage, and grass seeds and seedlings in the radicle and cotyledon stage
   were ingested in similar but lower amounts. Importantly, ingestion of
   seedlings, in contrast to seeds, was lethal for all plant species.
   Moreover, earthworm weight change varied with the functional identity
   and vitality of seeds and natural N-15 signatures in earthworm body
   tissue underlined the importance of seedlings for earthworm nutrition.
   The results indicate that the anecic earthworm L. terrestris indeed
   functions as a granivore and seedling herbivore. The selectivity in
   seedling ingestion points at the potential of direct earthworm effects
   on plant community assembly. Further, seeds and seedlings most likely
   contribute significantly to earthworm nutrition potentially explaining
   the collection and concentration of seeds by L terrestris in its middens
   and burrows; however, the present results call for experiments under
   more natural conditions. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of species diversity in modified and natural habitats is
   a central focus of conservation biology. The Ibera Nature Reserve (INR)
   protects highly diverse ecosystems in northeastern Argentina, including
   one of the largest freshwater wetlands in South America. Livestock
   grazing is one of the major disturbances to these ecosystems; however,
   its effect on ant diversity is poorly known. The objective of this work
   was to study the effect of savanna versus grassland and grazing on the
   structure and composition of subtropical terrestrial ants focusing on
   the particular response of the native red imported fire ant, Solenopsis
   invicta Buren. Unbaited pitfall traps were used to capture worker ants
   in 25 grazed and 20 nongrazed sites. Fifty ant species were collected.
   The savanna showed more species, individuals, biomass, and functional
   groups of ants than the grassland. S. invicta was the most frequently
   captured (61.4\%) and numerically dominant species; however Camponotus
   punctulatus punctulatus Mayr showed the highest biomass. Grazing
   simplified vegetation structure in both habitats, but its impact on
   vegetation seemed only to promote a higher total biomass especially in
   the grassland, and/or functional groups, favoring occurrence of
   hot-climate specialists in the savanna. This study revealed that habitat
   type strongly affected the organization of the terrestrial ant
   assemblages at the INR. However, as in other studies, we did not find
   clear evidence that habitat modification by grazing significantly
   affected terrestrial ant assemblages. The weak grazing influence could
   be the consequence of the short enclosure time as to recover the
   original ant communities, the differential response of ant species to
   habitat type, and/or the resilience of ants.}},

Abstract = {{Increases in fertilizer inputs and livestock numbers affect plant
   species composition and richness; this in turn can affect the
   biodiversity of soil fauna and nutrient cycling in pastures. We selected
   two adjacent farmlets to study these effects. Since 1980, one farmlet
   (LF) had not received superphosphate fertilizer (SSP) and has a low
   stock density of sheep, and the other (HF) had received 37.5 g SSP m(-2)
   y(-1) and has a high stock density. In 2004, at both farmlets, we
   commenced treatments for 4 years, adding urea to raise N status, and
   non-residual selective herbicide to remove broadleaf species. Long-term
   SSP addition and increased sheep numbers, and added urea increased
   herbage production but reduced plant diversity. The effect of treatments
   on most of the soil biochemical and biological properties varied between
   years. This may have partly arisen from an infestation with Wiseana
   caterpillars in the first winter, causing resources to be low and total
   soil carbon (C) to be reduced by 4-8\%; total C did, however, recover in
   later years. The urea and herbicide treatments caused greater changes
   above-ground than below-ground, but they did reduce soil microbial C and
   N and nematode diversity; urea at LF increased mineralizable N to the
   levels found at HF. On an area basis, HF generally had higher total C
   and N. earthworm and nematode numbers (including bacterial feeders,
   predators and omnivores), and nematode diversity, and greater values for
   the nematode channel ratio, than did LF. In contrast, the ratios of
   microbial C/total C and microbial N/total N, total mite numbers
   (including Oribatida, but not other mite groups), and fungal-feeding
   nematode numbers were higher at LF than at HF. Canonical correlation
   analysis suggested the plant and soil nematode communities responded in
   tandem and in predictable ways to the same environmental factors.
   Increased quantity and quality of inputs disadvantaged the fungal-based
   energy channel, with a measurable decline in the quantity of fungal
   phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). While the quantity of bacterial PLFAs
   appeared to be unaffected by greater plant-derived inputs, the greater
   numbers of bacterial-feeding nematodes at the HF farmlet suggests the
   activity and flow of energy and nutrients through the bacterial
   community would be more important in the HF than the LF farmlet. Overall
   our results suggest the shift from fungal to bacterial pathways may lead
   to soil microbial/microfaunal interactions that retain less reactive N
   within soil biomass, with a consequent greater risk of N loss. (C) 2010

   species richness and diversity (H') and the densities of individuals

   25-year-old forest stands. In forests, the richness and densities of

   species' richness and the densities of individuals were highest in
   25-year-old woods nearing felling time. Some forest butterfly species
   were observed only in forests. The species richness and densities of
   grassland butterflies were much higher in cut-over lands 0 and 5 year
   post felling than in forests; grassland species were rarely found in
   stands >= 10 year old. Thus, cut-over lands seem to function as
   temporary habitats for grassland species. Furthermore, the number of
   forest butterfly species was the same in cut-over lands 5 year after
   felling and in 25-year-old forest stands; the densities of forest
   butterfly species was higher in these cut-over lands than in the forest
   stands. Forest butterfly species living on cut-over land 5 year post
   felling sipped flower nectar, laid eggs on host plants, and practiced
   territorial behaviour involved in mate finding. Hence, these cut-over
   lands functioned as important habitats for various developmental stages

Abstract = {{Rapid biodiversity assessment (RBA) is proposed as an affordable
   indicator for monitoring local species richness of arthropods and
   sustainability of related ecosystem services. The indicator is based on
   strictly standardised sampling procedures and the identification of
   parataxonomic units (morphospecies) instead of species identification.
   The collection of arthropods was optimized with regard to trap types,
   time and length of collecting period, selection of four out of seven
   weekly samples, and choice of counted taxa and trophic guilds. By
   measuring arthropod activity, RBA is an indicator for functional
   diversity. Over a period of 8 years, average yearly numbers of
   morphospecies were assessed in Switzerland in 15 agricultural habitats,
   15 managed forests, and in 12 unmanaged habitats ranging from protected
   lowland wetlands to Alpine meadows. The yearly RBA-trend in unmanaged
   habitats is used for assessing the influence of climate and weather on
   biodiversity, and as a reference for measuring the relative influences
   of recent management changes in agriculture and forestry. The average
   number of morphospecies per sampling station per year depends on
   temperature, and was only marginally significantly increasing over time
   in agriculture, but not in forestry or unmanaged areas. Three RBA

Abstract = {{There is a growing recognition that to effectively conserve biodiversity
   efforts have to extend into the realm of engaging private landowners.
   Agricultural lands have been particularly attractive targets for
   integrating conservation and production goals. Changes in hayfield
   management associated with agricultural intensification, including
   earlier and more frequent harvests, have a severe impact on grassland
   birds. Government-administered conservation incentive programs benefit
   grassland birds by delaying harvest dates on enrolled land to allow
   nesting pairs to successfully fledge at least one brood during the
   breeding season. In contrast, hayfields that are mowed during the
   breeding season support sink populations and may function as ecological
   traps. We examined the effect of increasing levels of hayfield
   enrollment on grasshopper sparrow population viability using a
   spatially-explicit, stage-structured, stochastic model of a grasshopper
   sparrow metapopulation in an urbanizing region of New Jersey. The
   probability of metapopulation extinction (POE) decreased as the
   proportion of enrolled hayfields increased and fell below 10\% when
   about half of all available agricultural land was enrolled. POE also
   decreased with increasing numbers of enrolled hayfields most likely
   because hayfield enrollment removes a sink population from the landscape
   in addition to creating a source population. Our results are encouraging
   as they demonstrate that extinction risk for this grassland-dependent
   imperiled species can be reduced without having to protect or manage all
   remaining grassland habitat in the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification is one of the main drivers of farmland bird
   declines, but effects on birds may be confounded with those of climate
   change. Here we examine the effects of intensification and climate
   change on a grassland breeding wader, the Black-tailed Godwit Limosa l.
   limosa, in the Netherlands. Population decline has been linked to poor
   chick survival which, in turn, has been linked to available foraging
   habitat. Foraging habitat of the nidifugous chicks consists of uncut
   grasslands that provide cover and arthropod prey. Conservation measures
   such as agri-environment schemes aim to increase the availability of
   chick foraging habitat but have not yet been successful in halting the
   decline. Field observations show that since the early 1980s, farmers
   advanced their first seasonal mowing or grazing date by 15 days, whereas
   Godwits did not advance their hatching date. Ringing data indicate that
   between 1945 and 1975 hatching dates advanced by about 2 weeks in
   parallel with the advancement of median mowing dates. Surprisingly,
   temperature sums at median mowing and hatching dates suggest that while
   the agricultural advancement before 1980 was largely due to agricultural
   intensification, after 1980 it was largely due to climate change.
   Examining arthropod abundance in a range of differently managed
   grasslands revealed that chick food abundance was little affected but
   that food accessibility in intensively used tall swards may be
   problematic for chicks. Our results suggest that, compared with 25 years
   ago, nowadays (1) a much higher proportion of clutches and chicks are
   exposed to agricultural activities, (2) there is little foraging habitat
   left when chicks hatch and (3) because of climate change, the vegetation
   in the remaining foraging habitat is taller and denser and therefore of
   lower quality. This indicates that for agri-environment schemes to make
   a difference, they should not only be implemented in a larger percentage
   of the breeding area than the current maxima of 20-30\% but they should
   also include measures that create more open, accessible swards.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Insect herbivory can strongly affect ecosystem processes, and its
   relationship with plant diversity is a central topic in
   biodiversity-functioning research. However, very little is known about
   this relationship from complex ecosystems dominated by long-lived
   individuals, such as forests, especially over gradients of high plant
   diversity.
   2. We analysed insect herbivory on saplings of 10 tree and shrub species
   across 27 forest stands differing in age and tree species richness in an
   extraordinarily diverse subtropical forest ecosystem in China. We tested
   whether plant species richness significantly influences folivory in
   these highly diverse forests or whether other factors play a more
   important role at such high levels of phytodiversity.
   3. Leaf damage was assessed on 58 297 leaves of 1284 saplings at the end
   of the rainy season in 2008, together with structural and abiotic stand
   characteristics.
   4. Species-specific mean damage of leaf area ranged from 3\% to 16\%.
   Herbivory increased with plant species richness even after accounting
   for potentially confounding effects of stand characteristics, of which
   stand age-related aspects most clearly covaried with herbivory.
   Intraspecific density dependence or other abiotic factors did not
   significantly influence overall herbivory across forest stands.
   5. Synthesis. The positive herbivory-plant diversity relationship
   indicates that effects related to hypotheses of resource concentration,
   according to which a reduction in damage by specialized herbivores might
   be expected as host plant concentration decreases with increasing plant
   diversity, do not seem to be major determinants for overall herbivory
   levels in our phytodiverse subtropical forest ecosystem. We discuss the
   potential role of host specificity of dominant herbivores, which are
   often expected to show a high degree of specialization in many
   (sub)tropical forests. In the forest system we studied, a much higher
   impact of polyphagous species than traditionally assumed might explain
   the observed patterns, as these species can profit from a broad dietary
   mix provided by high plant diversity. Further testing is needed to
   experimentally verify this assumption.}},

Abstract = {{Although slugs (Mollusca: Gastropoda) are known to be important
   generalist herbivores, fungivores, and detrivores in a variety of
   ecosystems, little is known about their abundance and diversity in
   protected areas. Likewise, the presence of non-native slug species and
   their impacts on invaded ecosystems have also not been well documented.
   In this study, the abundance and diversity of native and non-native
   slugs was investigated in a sensitive protected area comprised of a
   recently burned black spruce (Picea mariana) - lichen (Cladonia)
   woodland in Terra Nova National Park, Newfoundland, Canada. To estimate
   the diversity and abundance of slugs, pitfall traps were established in
   areas of high-burn intensity, including sites within and at the edge of
   the burn, low-burn intensity, and a non-burned reference. Of the nine
   slug taxa known from Newfoundland, five were captured within burned
   sites; of those five taxa, only one, Deroceras laeve, is native. Almost
   90\% of captures were of non-native taxa; dominant slug taxa were the
   introduced Anion subfuscus aggregate (agg.) and A. hortensis agg. The
   majority of captures occurred at the edge of the burn, and least in the
   high-intensity open sites. Given that non-native species can dominate
   the slug fauna in naturally disturbed areas, it is recommended that
   monitoring for these non-native invasive species and their impact on
   native vegetation be implemented within protected areas. The invasive
   nature of non-native slugs and their pivotal role in in uencing
   biodiversity and plant regeneration suggests that these invertebrates
   are key elements within a monitoring framework of protected areas.}},

Abstract = {{The resistance of a plant community against herbivore attack may depend

   system to study the effects of selective herbivory on consumption
   resistance and recovery after herbivory in 81 experimental grassland
   plots. Communities were established from seed in 2002 and contained 1,
   2, 4, 8, 16 or 60 plant species of 1, 2, 3 or 4 functional groups. In
   2004, pairs of enclosure cages (1 m tall, 0.5 m diameter) were set up on
   all 81 plots. One randomly selected cage of each pair was stocked with
   10 male and 10 female nymphs of the meadow grasshopper, Chorthippus
   parallelus. The grasshoppers fed for 2 months, and the vegetation was
   monitored over 1 year. Consumption resistance and recovery of vegetation
   were calculated as proportional changes in vegetation biomass. Overall,
   grasshopper herbivory averaged 6.8\%. Herbivory resistance and recovery
   were influenced by plant functional group identity, but independent of
   plant species richness and number of functional groups. However,
   herbivory induced shifts in vegetation composition that depended on
   plant species richness. Grasshopper herbivory led to increases in herb
   cover at the expense of grasses. Herb cover increased more strongly in
   species-rich mixtures. We conclude that selective herbivory changes the

   changes due to selective herbivory depend on plant species richness.}},

Abstract = {{Dung fauna plays an important role in dung decomposition, a key

   diversity of a three-species community (dung beetles, dung flies and
   epigeic earthworms) was systematically manipulated to produce different

   communities were introduced to standardised dung pats in laboratory
   experiments. Dung decomposition was modelled using an analysis that
   disentangled species identity effects and the interactions among species
   that contribute to the diversity effect. This revealed that the net
   diversity effect was composed of positive (fly-earthworm), negative
   (beetle-earthworm) and neutral (fly-beetle) effects of species
   interaction. These pairwise interactions resulted in complex, but
   systematically varying and predictable effects on dung decomposition as
   the relative abundances of species changed. Decomposition was
   consistently greater in communities with higher decomposer biomass. The
   utility of the adopted analytical approach was emphasised by comparison
   with an ANOVA that found that dung decomposition did not differ among
   evenness levels. Thus, the averaging of decomposition across different
   community structures within evenness levels masked the different effects
   of species interactions. These results highlight methodological insights

Abstract = {{An assessment of nonequilibrium rangeland dynamics was conducted in the
   Aru basin, a semiarid site located in the very dry northwest part of the
   Chang Tang Nature Reserve, Tibet, China. A grazing gradient approach was
   used to examine the effects of different livestock grazing intensities
   on vegetation, providing data to determine if plant herbivore
   interaction has been a major structuring force of the plant community
   and thus to indicate what type of dynamic might apply in the study area.
   No significant differences were found between a highly grazed site and a
   lightly grazed site in vegetation cover, standing biomass, and Shannon
   Wiener species diversity index of total, graminoid, forb, and tomtza
   (Oxytropis glacialis Benth. ex Bunge) functional groups, with the
   exception that tomtza coverage was significantly higher at the highly
   grazed (1.04\%) than at the lightly grazed site (0.02\%). Grazing
   intensity alone did not explain a significant amount of variation in the
   plant species data. These results indicate that a dominance of
   nonequilibrium dynamics appears to be the case in the basin, probably
   one of the least-arid sites in the northwest Chang Tang region of the
   Tibetan Plateau. Thus, opportunistic livestock management strategies
   adapted to variable vegetation production from year to year, rather than
   the setting of a rigid stocking rate that assumes a stable carrying
   capacity, is probably the most plausible approach for managing livestock

Abstract = {{The demand for sensitive biological tools to assess the environmental
   quality of coastal waters at broad spatial scales is increasing. Many of
   the tools used are based on the taxonomic composition of biotic
   assemblages. They usually require a valuable taxonomic expertise while
   are unique reflecting the overall ecosystem integrity. Here, we evaluate
   the potential indicator value of several features of the epiphytic
   community (overall assemblage composition, species richness, and
   proportion of the main taxonomic groups) growing on the seagrass
   Posidonia oceanica leaves. We do so by empirically examining their
   changes along a disturbance gradient where multiple human activities
   have interactive and cumulative impacts, sampling at different spatial
   scales and at two different depths (5 and 15 m). Our results show that
   the specific composition of the epiphytic assemblages (i.e. species
   composition) closely reflects, in the deep meadows, the combined effects
   of different anthropogenic stressors along the gradient, showing an
   integrative and non-specific response. Similarly, an increase in the
   proportion of hydrozoans, and a decrease in the proportion of
   rhodophytes and chlorophytes are observed in deep meadows along the
   gradient. In shallow meadows, grazing and biotic features of the
   seagrass seem the main forcing factors determining species composition,
   and therefore masking the response of epiphytes to the deterioration
   gradient. After address the effect of natural sources of variability
   (water depth, within- and between-meadow heterogeneity), changes in
   epiphyte assemblages and in the proportion of hydrozoans, rhodophytes
   and chlorophytes in relatively deep meadows seem promising monitoring
   tools for detecting coastal environmental deterioration. (C) 2010

Abstract = {{Species distributions are determined by complex interplays between
   multi-scale factors. Conservation management, however, often occurs at a
   single scale of the site level. This is true for bird communities of
   restored savannas and mixed woodlands in the central U.S. In this
   region, many historic open-canopy oak savanna habitats have become
   closed canopy mixed woodlands due to loss of landscape-scale disturbance
   from fire and grazing. Site-level management efforts return some mixed
   woodland habitats back to savanna through fire and mechanical thinning.
   Savanna and woodland historically formed complex mosaic landscapes at
   the ecotone between prairies and Eastern deciduous forests and now exist
   within landscapes that vary in amount of open (e.g., perennial grassland
   and row crop agriculture) and woodland habitat. To understand the
   interplay between site and landscape level factors in savanna
   restoration, we sampled the breeding bird community in four combinations
   of site and landscape: restored savanna in open landscapes, restored
   savanna in woodland landscapes, and closed canopy woodland in both
   landscapes. We found that the outcome of site-level savanna restoration
   depended on the surrounding landscape. Compared to other treatment
   types, restored savannas in open landscapes supported a distinctive bird
   community characterized by high species richness, bird abundance, and
   percent of ground feeders, shrub nesters. and edge species. Both savanna
   and woodland sites in the open landscape had a higher percent of species
   of conservation concern, while at both site and landscape levels,
   woodland was associated with a higher percent of area sensitive species
   and habitat specialists. Our results suggest savanna restoration efforts
   should focus on sites that exist either in open country or on edges
   where closed canopy forest meets open country. This strategy would
   combine site and landscape level benefits of savanna restoration for
   avian diversity, while also preserving the conservation benefits of
   large tracts of intact forest. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   on proxy indicators representing an alternative to the direct impact
   measurement on two grassland bird species, the lapwing Vanellus vanellus
   and the redshank Tringa totanus. Models were developed using stepwise
   selection procedures or Bayesian model averaging (BMA). Sensitivity,
   specificity, and probability of correctly ranking fields (area under the
   curve, AUC) were estimated for each individual indicator or model from
   observational data measured on 252 grazed plots during 2 years. The cost
   of implementation of each model was computed as a function of the number
   and types of input variables. Among all management indicators, 50\% had
   an AUC lower than or equal to 0.50 and thus were not better than a
   random decision. Independently of the statistical procedure, models
   combining management indicators were always more accurate than
   individual indicators for lapwings only. In redshanks, models based
   either on BMA or some selection procedures were non-informative. Higher
   accuracy could be reached, for both species, with model mixing
   management and habitat indicators. However, this increase in accuracy
   was also associated with an increase in model cost. Models derived by
   BMA were more expensive and slightly less accurate than those derived
   with selection procedures. Analysing trade-offs between accuracy and
   cost of indicators opens promising application perspectives as time
   consuming and expensive indicators are likely to be of low practical
   utility}},

Abstract = {{In grassland reserves, managed disturbance is often necessary to
   maintain plant species diversity. We carried out experiments to
   determine the impact of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing and disc
   ploughing on grassland species richness and composition in a nature
   reserve in semi-arid eastern Australia. Vegetation response was
   influenced by winter-spring drought after establishment of the
   experiments, but moderate rainfall followed in late summer-autumn.
   Species composition varied greatly between sampling times, and the
   variability due to rainfall differences between seasons and years was
   greater than the effects of fire, kangaroo grazing, mowing or disc
   ploughing. In the fire experiment, species richness and composition
   recovered more rapidly after spring than autumn burning. Species
   richness and composition were similar to control sites within 12 months
   of burning and mowing, suggesting that removal of the dominant grass
   canopy is unnecessary to enhance plant diversity. Two fires (separated
   by 3 years) and post-fire kangaroo grazing had only minor influence on
   species richness and composition. Even disc ploughing caused only a
   small reduction in native richness. The minor impact of ploughing was
   explained by the small areas that were ploughed, the once-off nature of
   the treatment, and the high degree of natural movement and cracking in
   these shrink-swell soils. Recovery of the composition and richness of
   these grasslands was rapid because of the high proportion of perennial
   species that resprout vegetatively after fire and mowing. There appears
   to be little conservation benefit from fire, mowing or ploughing
   ungrazed areas, as we could identify no native plant species dependent
   on frequent disturbance for persistence in this grassland community.
   However, the ability of the Astrebla- and Dichanthium-dominated
   grasslands to recover quickly after disturbance, given favourable
   seasonal conditions, suggests that they are well adapted to natural
   disturbances (e.g. droughts, fire, flooding and native grazing).}},

Abstract = {{In annual crops, where disturbance intensities are generally high,
   numerous investigations demonstrated beneficial effects of organic and
   other extensive farming practices on biodiversity. It is however unclear
   if organic farming has the same beneficial effect in perennial crops
   (e.g. vineyards) because of a generally reduced background disturbance
   level. Moreover, the impact of farming practices on biodiversity may
   differ between trophic levels. We tested the effect of farming practices
   differing in disturbance intensity on the abundance, species richness
   and community composition of three trophic levels (plants, grasshoppers
   and spiders) in Swiss vineyards. Organic and conventional vineyards were
   compared, and within the latter different options of weed control
   (mowing vs. mulching) and pest management (hand spraying vs. helicopter
   spraying) were investigated. In contrast to findings in annual crops,
   organic farming promoted neither diversity nor abundance at any trophic
   level. Grasshopper diversity was even significantly lower in organic
   compared to conventional vineyards. Weed control as well as pest
   management differed in their effects, depending on the trophic level.
   Within conventionally managed vineyards, spider and grasshopper
   diversity were enhanced by mulching, while plants benefited from the
   lower disturbance of mowing. The greater disturbance of fungicide
   spraying by hand than by helicopter was disadvantageous for
   grasshoppers, but did not affect spiders and plants. Thus, different
   taxa respond differently not only to an increase in disturbance but also
   to different types of disturbance and local site conditions. We conclude
   that disturbance in organically farmed vineyards appears to be too low
   to be beneficial for biodiversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Over the past half century, grassland birds in Europe have declined
   dramatically and in order to maintain and restore their populations it
   is critical to understand how habitat structures and quality within
   pastures affect birds. This study investigated the effects of habitat
   structure and pasture abandonment on grassland birds in IBA Ponor,
   western Bulgaria. Birds were sampled using the point count method at 143
   randomly located circular plots and a total of 1,401 observations of
   birds from 31 species were recorded. The results showed that habitat
   complexity, management and landscape position influenced bird community
   structure and species occurrence within the upland pastures. Extensively
   grazed pastures supported higher structural complexity of vegetation
   cover and higher bird-species richness and diversity compared with
   abandoned ones. Moreover, bird species with a preference for grazed
   rather than abandoned pastures had higher conservation status and most
   were associated with shrub cover. To maintain high levels of avian
   diversity, habitat complexity within pastures should be maintained
   through extensive grazing, to ensure availability of scrub vegetation
   wherever possible. Finally, this study provided evidence that
   agri-environmental schemes should not be directly extrapolated from one
   country or region to another without been tested first, because within
   the same management, differences in habitat structural characteristics
   may exist due to the landscape and socio-economic characteristics of the

Abstract = {{2. This paper examines the effect of intraspecific genetic diversity
   within Brassica fields on two Brassica specialists, cabbage root fly,
   and diamondback moth, and on a parasitoid attacking diamondback moths.
   Genetic diversity was manipulated both in a replacement and an additive
   design.
   3. Both herbivore densities and parasitism rates were higher in smaller
   plots, with limited responses to increased within-plot diversity. All
   species showed variable densities across genotypes, and preference
   hierarchies were species specific.
   4. Responses to plot size in root flies scaled with the diameter-to-area
   ratio, suggesting that patch detectability affected local density,
   whereas responses by diamondback moths and parasitoids deviated from
   this ratio. These species differences could be traced to differences in
   the residence time within patches, where diamondback moths typically
   spend longer and more variable time periods in patches than root flies.
   5. The lack of response to genetic diversity by both herbivores suggests
   that egg-laying rates are affected by decisions on the plant and not by
   attraction from a distance, neither to the plant itself nor the patch.
   Patterns of differential attack may then be due to different
   acceptability for studied genotypes.
   6. Future theories on insect responses to spatial heterogeneity should
   focus on species traits and how traits interact with information

Abstract = {{Invertebrate herbivores are ubiquitous in most terrestrial ecosystems,
   and theory predicts that their impact on plant community biomass should
   depend on diversity and productivity of the associated plant
   communities. To elucidate general patterns in the relationship between
   invertebrate herbivory, plant diversity, and productivity, we carried
   out a long-term herbivore exclusion experiment at multiple grassland
   sites in a mountainous landscape of central Germany. Over a period of
   five years, we used above-and belowground insecticides as well as a
   molluscicide to manipulate invertebrate herbivory at 14 grassland sites,
   covering a wide range of plant species diversity (13-38 species/m(2))
   and aboveground plant productivity (272-1125 g.m(-2).yr(-1)), where
   plant species richness and productivity of the sites were not
   significantly correlated.
   Herbivore exclusion had significant effects on the plant communities: it
   decreased plant species richness and evenness, and it altered plant
   community composition. In particular, exclusion of belowground
   herbivores promoted grasses at the expense of herbs. In contrast to our
   expectation, herbivore effects on plant community biomass were not
   influenced by productivity. However, effect size of invertebrate
   herbivores was negatively correlated with plant diversity of the
   grasslands: the effect of herbivory on biomass tended to be negative at
   sites of high diversity and positive at sites of low diversity. In
   general, the effects of aboveground herbivores were relatively small as
   compared to belowground herbivores, which were important drivers of
   plant community composition. Our study is the first to show that
   variation in the effects of invertebrate herbivory on plant communities

   block experiments were established to determine optimum combinations of
   grazing management and mechanical or herbicide treatments to control
   thistles within lowland and upland grazing systems. Factorial
   combinations of tight vs. lenient grazing in spring and autumn with
   additional treatments of winter grazing were compared. Thistle control
   methods were applied in sub-treatments for the first 2 years: cutting
   twice yearly, herbicide wiping, and cutting followed by herbicide
   application. Thistle abundance decreased under lenient grazing in
   spring, autumn and winter at the lowland site, under lenient spring and
   winter grazing in the uplands and under cattle compared with sheep
   grazing. Herbicide wiping was the most effective control measure and
   cutting the least, but effects of all weed control sub-treatments were
   lost rapidly, so lenient grazing was sufficient to give long-term
   thistle control. Lenient grazing and herbicide wiping also caused small
   declines in non-target forb diversity. Control of creeping thistle can
   therefore be achieved without herbicides because lenient grazing in
   spring and autumn can decrease thistle populations to sufficiently low
   levels. Severe infestations can be more rapidly controlled using
   herbicides, but are better avoided at botanically diverse sites.
   Ecologically-based weed control strategies have great potential, but

Abstract = {{Aims
   Invasion resistance in experimental plant communities is known to
   increase with increasing diversity and further to depend on the presence
   of particular functional groups. To test whether these effects also hold
   true for the invader establishment phase beyond the seedling stage, we
   studied survival and performance of Centaurea jacea L. (brown knapweecl)
   planted into experimental grassland communities of varying plant
   biodiversity over three consecutive years. Moreover, we analysed the
   role of insect herbivory and biomass of the recipient community for
   mediating diversity effects.
   Methods
   In 2005, seedlings of Centaurea were transplanted into experimental
   grassland communities (the Jena Experiment) covering a species richness
   (1-60) and functional group richness (1-4) gradient. Half of these
   transplants and the community surrounding them in each plot were sprayed
   with insecticide while the other half served as control. In 2006 and
   2007 (during the second and third year after transplantation), we
   recorded survival, growth-related (e.g. transplant biomass, height) and
   reproduction-related traits (e.g. number of flower heads). Annual data
   on community aboveground biomass served as covariate to investigate
   mediating effects of aboveground competition with the recipient
   community.
   Important Findings
   Species richness was the most important factor responsible for Centaurea
   limitation. Higher levels of diversity decreased survival and all
   performance traits in both years. These diversity effects were partly
   driven by community biomass, but not fully explained by that covariate,
   suggesting the importance also of further processes. The influence of
   functional group richness was strong in the second year after
   transplantation and weaker in the third year. Among the particular
   functional groups, only the presence of legumes showed strong negative
   effects on Centaurea survival and weak negative effects on growth and
   reproduction, the latter two being mediated by biomass.
   Insect herbivore reduction considerably benefited Centaurea in sprayed
   monocultures, where it grew significantly larger than in all other
   diversity levels and than in the control subplots. We conclude that
   effects of plant community properties on invading individuals change in
   the course of establishment, that plant species richness effects are
   also important during later stages of establishment, and that biomass
   (especially at high diversity) and herbivory (especially at low
   diversity) of the recipient community are important in mediating
   community effects on invaders.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the relationships between biodiversity and land-use is a
   key element for the development of effective conservation strategies. We
   studied a mid-altitude steppe-like area of Southern France, the Causse
   de Sauveterre, that has been grazed for many centuries. The decrease of
   human population during the 20th century, particularly since the end of
   2nd World War, and the ongoing changes in agricultural practices may
   have dramatic effects on many biodiversity components of these
   landscapes. Our study assesses landscape change and modifications in
   bird community composition through the repeated sampling of a network of
   sites after an interval of 15-19 years. We paid particular attention to
   the possible consequences of recent changes in agricultural policy on
   these communities.
   Landscape changes were studied through remote sensing, and bird
   community and vegetation changes by field sampling on 183 sites.
   Correspondence Analysis showed an overall trend towards landscape
   closure. This results in a decrease of open-habitat species that are
   fairly rare in Europe (e.g. Tawny Pipit Anthus campestris, Linnet
   Carduelis cannabina. Ortolan Bunting Emberiza hortulana), and in an
   increase of common forest species (e.g. the Common Chiffchaff
   Phylloscopus collybita and Winter Wren Troglodytes troglodytes).
   Although most of the avifauna changes seem to be explained by local
   landscape changes, the decrease of certain bird species as Bullfinch
   Pyrrhula pyrrhula and Citril Finch Serinus citrinella may result from
   population changes at larger scales. The current closure of the
   landscape represents a threat for several steppe species whose
   conservation status is unfavourable in Europe. This closure does not
   result from a decrease in human population and/or in flock number, as
   observed in many Mediterranean hinterlands. It rather results from a
   shift from a former extensive pastoralism, where sheep grazed
   steppe-like grasslands (rangeland grazing), towards a more intensive
   herding that use hay and cereal foodstocks cultivated on the more
   productive areas of the farms. To alleviate the observed trends,
   subsidies should be oriented towards the compensation of a possible loss
   of income resulting from the maintenance of the traditional extensive
   pastoralism. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Species loss has negative consequences in fodder production
   In this study, the link between species loss, the functioning of a
   grassland ecosystem and the production of fodder is investigated. The
   study area is located on the slope of Monte Generoso in Ticino and
   consists of two adjacent meadows at Pree and Poma. In 1950 two
   smallholder dairy farms were still based on these meadows, one farm on
   each meadow. Whereas mowing has been carried out regularly in Pree until
   today, the meadows of Poma changed after a period of interrupted mowing
   (1968-1987) into a mosaic of birch woodland, hazel shrubs and fallow
   grassland dominated by tor grass (Brachypodium pinnatum). Many
   specialist species of meadows, including the most valuable fodder
   plants, were lost. Since 1988 an area without woody plants of c. 200
   m(2) has been regularly mowed and species composition and phytomass
   monitored. The initially unbroken dominance of tor grass decreased over
   20 years while the displaced species hardly reestablished themselves.
   The standing crop was reduced by 45\% during the same period and is now
   below the level of the standing crop in the species-rich, unfertilized
   dry meadow at Pree. Thus, species richness ensures the production of
   fodder that can be gained from unimproved grassland.}},

Abstract = {{In response to concern about the loss of ecosystem services once
   provided by natural riparian systems, state and federal agencies have
   established incentive programs for landowners to convert sensitive lands
   from agricultural to conservation uses. Enhancement of wildlife habitat,
   while identified as a function of such systems, has often been of
   secondary importance to soil conservation and water quality objectives.
   Though greatly important, little consideration has been given to how
   specific species will respond to the design and management of riparian
   buffers or other conservation lands. This study compared avian
   communities within a chronosequence of riparian buffers established on
   previously cropped or pastured land with those of the nearby matrix land
   cover types (row crop fields and an intensively grazed pasture). The
   riparian buffers consisted of native grasses, forbs, and woody
   vegetation established at three different times (2, 9, and 14+ years
   prior to survey). At each site, 10 min point counts for breeding birds
   were conducted using 50 m fixed radius plots, which were visited eight
   times between May 15 and July 10, 2008. A total of 54 bird species were
   observed over all of the study sites. The re-established riparian
   buffers in this study had higher bird abundance, richness, and diversity
   than the crop and pasture sites. These results suggest that
   re-establishing native riparian vegetation in areas of intensive
   agriculture will provide habitat for a broad suite of bird species, but
   that specific species will reflect successional stage, horizontal and
   vertical vegetative structure, and compositional diversity of the buffer
   vegetation. These results emphasize the importance of matching buffer
   design and management to species requirements if the objectives are to
   attract specific target species or species groups.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of different levels of cattle grazing on an arid Australian
   small terrestrial mammal and lizard assemblage was assessed in a
   long-tem series of cross-fence comparisons. Cross-fenced sites were
   closely matched for edaphic and vegetation characteristics and
   experienced near identical weather patterns, to ensure that cattle
   grazing pressure was the principal determinant of any differences in
   fauna assemblages. In addition, the effects of removal of cattle, cats,
   foxes and rabbits from three of these long-term monitoring sites were
   assessed to determine the relative impacts of cattle grazing and feral
   animals. Small mammal captures, with the exception of Mus musculus,
   revealed a significant negative response to cattle grazing pressure but
   this response was of a considerably lower magnitude than the dramatic
   increase in rodent captures and species richness within the feral
   animal-proof Arid Recovery Reserve. Higher kangaroo numbers in ungrazed
   controls, compared with treatments grazed by cattle, possibly negated
   the benefits to small mammals of removing cattle grazing. No reptile
   species responded significantly to the grazing treatments although
   reptile richness and captures of geckos and skinks were the lowest and
   agamid captures were the highest at heavily grazed sites. Nephrurus
   levis was the only reptile species to increase significantly, while
   captures of some smaller geckoes declined, within the feral-proof
   treatment. Feral predation exerted a more significant effect on most
   small mammal species than the levels of cattle grazing assessed in this
   study, yet reptile responses to grazing or feral animals were less
   apparent and were likely primarily driven by changes in vegetation cover
   or secondary trophic impacts.}},

Abstract = {{To accurately measure the number of species in a biological community, a
   complete inventory should be performed, which is generally unfeasible;
   hopefully, estimators of species richness can help. Our main objectives
   were (i) to assess the performance of nonparametric estimators of plant
   species richness with real data from a small set of meadows located in
   the Basque campia (northern Spain), and (ii) to apply the best estimator
   to a larger dataset to test the effects on plant species richness caused
   by environmental conditions and human practices. Two non-asymptotic and
   seven asymptotic accumulation functions were fitted to a randomized
   sample-based rarefaction curve computed with data from three well
   sampled meadows, and information theoretic methods were used to select
   the best fitting model; this was the Morgan-Mercer-Flodin, and its
   asymptote was taken as our best guess of true richness. Then, five
   nonparametric estimators were computed: ICE, Chao 2, Jackknife 1 and 2,
   and Bootstrap; MMRuns and MMMeans were also assessed. According to the
   criteria set for our performance assessment (i.e., bias, precision, and
   accuracy), the best estimator was Jackknife 1. Finally, Jackknife 1 was
   applied to assess the effects of terrain slope and soil parent material,
   and also fertilization, grazing, and mowing, on plant species richness
   from a larger dataset (20 meadows). Results suggested that grass cutting
   was causing a loss of richness close to 30\%, as compared to unmowed
   meadows. It is concluded that the use of nonparametric estimators of
   species richness can improve the evaluation of biodiversity responses to
   human management practices.}},

   The Brazilian Pantanal is one of the world's largest freshwater wetlands

   subject to pluri-annual extreme dry and wet periods, which cause extreme
   flood and drought events, which strongly affect wildlife. Using the
   line-transect method, this study examined the distribution of densities
   and metabolic biomass of medium- to large-sized nonvolant mammals in
   forest, cerrado and floodplain landscapes, in an area with low
   anthropogenic influence, in the central area of the Brazilian Pantanal
   during a prolonged drought. Comparisons with a previous survey conducted
   during years of average rainfall in part of the study area suggest that
   population fluctuations of certain species are closely associated with
   water due to the drought. Results from this study showed that mammal
   assemblages varied between landscapes. Forested landscapes have the
   highest densities of mammals and are the most important in terms of
   relative energy consumption. In addition, at the time of the study,
   frugivores were found to have higher energy consumption than
   browser/grazers across the three landscapes; most fruits are produced in
   forested areas stressing their importance. By converting forested
   landscapes into grasslands, the intensification of ranching practices

Abstract = {{Species-rich grasslands are rare in the Netherlands and need consistent
   vegetation management to retain their characteristic biodiversity.
   Roadside verges are important refuges for grassland plants since the
   mowing management no longer aims at traffic safety only but also strives
   for botanical diversity. Although arthropods are highly abundant in
   roadside verges, the effect of different mowing practices on this group
   is largely unknown. During 4 years, we studied ground beetles, weevils,
   ants and ground-dwelling spiders with pitfall traps in experimental
   plots in roadside verges with five different mowing treatments: (i) no
   management, (ii) and (iii) mowing once a year with and without hay
   removal, (iv) and (v) mowing twice a year with and without hay removal.
   This was done in a plant productivity gradient: the experiment was
   repeated in low-, medium- and high-productive verges. In the
   low-productive site, the effect of management on the arthropods only
   existed in a higher abundance in plots mown twice per year with hay
   removal. In the medium- and high-productive sites, mowing twice a year
   with hay removal resulted not only in highest abundances but also in
   highest arthropod species richness. Mowing twice without hay removal and
   mowing once with removal showed intermediate values, while mowing once
   per year without removal and particularly the absence of management
   resulted in low diversity and low abundance. To promote ground-dwelling
   arthropods in medium-to-high-productive grassland verges, we recommend a
   management of mowing twice a year with the removal of hay. It is
   reasoned that some form of rotational management, aiming at leaving some
   vegetation refuges intact after mowing events, may further promote
   arthropod survival. However, caution should be taken that these refuges
   are not too large, as overall suitability for ground-dwelling arthropod
   decreases rapidly in such patches. Out of several studied vegetation
   characteristics, the number of flowering plant species
   (medium-productive verge) and total flower abundance (high-productive
   verge) appeared to represent suitable, and easily monitored, proxies
   that significantly mirror arthropod diversity. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Environmental impact alters assemblages by increasing species
   relatedness, thus reducing phylogenetic and functional diversity. We
   assessed whether different controlled grazing regimes influenced the
   recovery of plant phylogenetic diversity (Average Taxonomic
   Distinctness, ATD) and functional diversity based on plant growth habit
   (GH) and life cycle duration (LCD) {[}Shannon-Weiner Index (H'),
   -In(Simpson's Index, D)] in pastures from previously unmanaged and
   highly overgrazed conditions. Plant presence/absence data were collected
   during August 2006 from a high altitude cold salt desert in
   south-western Utah, where controlled grazing has been maintained for
   over 70 years to study range restoration. Winter-spring and spring
   grazed pastures were examined at four grazing levels: ungrazed, light,
   medium, and heavy, with each level differing in the number of animal use
   days per hectare relative to available forage biomass. For
   winter-spring, animal use days were divided equally between the two
   seasons. Winter-spring grazing promoted recovery of plant phylogenetic
   and functional diversity compared to spring grazing as reflected by the
   consistently higher values of ATD, and the stability of species
   composition within each ecological trait and their similarity to values
   for ungrazed pastures. Spring grazing was detrimental to recovery
   efforts and resulted in the reduction of palatable non-grass species,
   ATD, and functional diversity with increased grazing intensity. Many
   significant positive correlations between phylogenetic and functional
   diversity indices existed during spring, but not winter-spring grazing.
   While H'(GH) was uncorrelated with ATD during winter-spring, it was
   positively correlated in spring, suggesting species in the plant
   community (based on growth habit) during spring were randomly assembled
   without influence from local species interactions, and that different
   growth habits are conserved within lineages so that communities randomly
   assembled from more lineages will have a greater diversity of growth
   habits than communities assembled from fewer lineages. H'(LCD) was
   negatively correlated with ATD during winter-spring, suggesting local
   species interactions naturally influence assemblage composition
   regarding life cycle duration. As such, species within the same lineage
   likely interact (compete) more for scarce resources because they share
   similar life cycle durations, thus leading to greater trait variation in
   communities with fewer lineages than in those with many lineages. Yet,
   this correlation was positive during spring, suggesting an overriding
   effect from grazing rather than local species interactions. Hence, sheep
   grazing at the DER appears to be a season-dependent driver of plant
   phylogenetic and functional diversity, and the correlations between
   them. We recommend Average Taxonomic Distinctness and functional
   diversity based on growth habit and life cycle duration be considered as
   significant developments in the construction of practical rapid
   assessment tools for biomonitoring and feedback regarding grazing
   impacts in similar ecosystems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Water resources demand constant conservation actions due to several
   problems (e.g. riparian vegetation cut-off, construction of dams.
   acidification, sewage and pesticide spills) that degrade the aquatic
   systems worldwide and affect its physicochemical parameters and habitat
   characteristics. Odonata is a potential group of organisms that could
   indicate these habitat alterations once they have aquatic and
   terrestrial life forms. In this study, we tested the use of adult
   odonate individual species and community assemblage measures to evaluate
   the effect of riparian vegetation cut-off and sewage discharges. The
   study was performed at Turvo Sujo River, in Vicosa, Southern Brazil. We
   selected twelve sites, six of them were upstream and six were downstream
   the city. Species abundance and species richness estimates of adult
   odonates were performed on sunny days during summer and winter. We
   analyzed the goodness-of-fit of the species abundances to geometric and
   lognormal series. We also measured the Habitat Physical Integrity Score
   (HPIS), pasture and forest proportions and physicochemical water
   parameters at each site. Only few species were abundant in up- and
   downstream regions. Abundance of Argia modesta was higher at the
   upstream (t = 3.188; df = 17: p = 0.005) than at the downstream region
   and this species is a potential habitat bioindicator organisms. Species
   richness was statistically different only in the wet season and
   species-abundance relations at the two regions fitted well to both
   geometric and lognormal series. The lack of riparian vegetation
   indicates a loss of habitat integrity and heterogeneity at Turvo Sujo
   River basin, which was mainly dominated by lake-dwelling odonate
   species. Low species richness differences are caused by species pool
   biases toward those ones capable to survive at degraded ecosystems,
   suggesting that the effects of water parameters are much less important
   than a landscape dominated by pastures and practically without forests.
   We suggest the use of species-abundance models (like geometric and
   lognormal series) to determine the degree of impacts over a given
   community once they are simple models and can show intrinsic processes

Abstract = {{The role of aquatic macrophyte architecture (leaf architecture
   complexity) in structuring and determining associated algal and
   invertebrate communities was studied in shallow ditches in coastal
   marshes under contrasting management (pasture and arable agriculture)
   and hence nutrient regime (eutrophic and hypertrophic). Variations in
   colonisation rates between functional feeding groups (macroinvertebrate
   community) and periphyton colonisation patterns were examined on
   artificial substrata units recreating three macrophyte leaf
   architectures -dissected, broad and flat-floating. Units increased in
   architectural complexity but total colonisable area was constant (255
   cm(2)). Habitat complexity had a major effect on macroinvertebrate
   colonisation in the pasture ditch units, particularly on predator
   species (Coleoptera, Hemiptera and Odonata) as well as for grazers,
   particularly Gastropoda. Macroinvertebrate abundance was significantly
   higher on the dissected leafed units. Rates of taxon colonisation
   (colonisation rates - decolonisation rates) were higher on the dissected
   and flat-floating leaf units (1.57 and 1.4 species day(-1),
   respectively) as was species richness (46 and 27 species, respectively)
   reaching equilibrium, when rates became equal, in about three weeks.
   Habitat complexity also modified periphyton assemblages. Algae-substrata
   associations and species richness were higher on the broad and dissected
   units in the pasture ditch (47 spp. and 43 of diatoms spp.; 11 and 15
   non-diatoms spp., respectively). Conversely, arable ditch units had a
   significantly higher density of periphyton and variations in community
   size and composition, with a few dominant non-diatom taxa, such as
   Lyngbya birgei, Anabaena spiroides, Spirulina princeps and Oedogonium
   sp., associated with reduced macroinvertebrate diversity and
   colonisation, in particular for grazer species. Thus, the experiments
   demonstrated that high architectural complexity plays an important role
   in shallow coastal ditches, promoting variation in food availability -
   more heterogeneous algal assemblages - and macroinvertebrate community
   succession. Hence, external variables, such as system productivity
   (eutrophic vs hypertrophic; bottom-up implications), seem to regulate
   and modify the effects of habitat spatial heterogeneity through
   epiphytic community growth and consequently macroinvertebrate
   colonization (species turnover rate).}},

Abstract = {{The preservation of biodiversity within agricultural landscapes in

   richness was not affected by grazing. Both plant and ant species
   richness was negatively affected by fertilisation. Neither ant nor plant

Abstract = {{P>1. The consequences of species loss on ecosystem functioning within a
   single trophic level have been extensively studied. However, the loss of
   basal species is likely to have profound impacts on the abundance,
   richness and ecosystem functioning of species at higher trophic levels.
   2. Here, we used experimentally established plant communities with a
   species richness gradient to study the effects of plant species loss on
   a multi-trophic insect community in the field. We measured densities and
   species richness of aphids and parasitic wasps (primary, secondary and
   facultative tertiary parasitoids of aphids) that naturally colonized the
   grassland plots.
   3. Furthermore, we calculated two ecosystem functions: aphid load (the
   number of aphid individuals per host plant biomass used as a proxy for
   herbivory) and parasitism rate. We used structural equation models to
   explore pathways of direct and indirect effects of plant species
   richness on higher trophic levels.
   4. We found that the densities and richness of species at all trophic
   levels were influenced by changes in plant species richness. The effects
   were rarely direct, but instead mediated by the abundance and species
   richness of aphid host plants and subsequent trophic levels.
   5. The herbivore and primary parasitoid levels were most directly
   affected by changes in plant species richness, with highest insect
   densities and species richness occurring at intermediate plant species
   richness. The densities and species richness of secondary parasitoids
   declined linearly with plant species richness owing to sparser
   resources, resulting in shorter food chains in communities with the
   highest plant species richness.
   6. Aphid load was highest at intermediate plant species richness and
   negatively affected by both host plant biomass and host plant species
   richness. Parasitism rate was mostly affected indirectly via aphid
   density and overall only weakly negatively related to plant species
   richness.
   7. Our results demonstrate that plant species richness can have strong
   cascading effects up to high trophic levels. However, their direction
   may differ at the lower and higher ends of the plant species richness
   spectrum, cautioning against simplifying consequences of plant species
   loss for specialist food webs that may become limited by sparse
   resources at high plant richness.}},

Abstract = {{Lowland riparian vegetation in the southwestern United States is
   critically important for maintaining a high richness and density of
   breeding birds. Further investigation is needed within riparian
   corridors, however, to evaluate the relative importance of vegetation
   type and hydrologic regime for avian density and nest survival as
   targets for regional conservation or restoration efforts. We estimated
   the densities of 40 bird species and for species grouped on the basis of
   nest height and dependence on surface water in gallery cottonwood-willow
   (Populus spp.-Salix spp.) forests, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) shrub lands,
   and terrace vegetation types along a gradient in the hydrologic regime
   of the San Pedro River, Arizona, USA. We also assessed nest survival for
   shrub-nesting insectivores and herbivores. Canopy-nesting birds as a
   group and 14 individual bird species reached their greatest densities in
   cottonwood forests regardless of the hydrologic regime. Water-dependent
   birds as a group reached their highest density in both intermittent-and
   perennial-flow cottonwood stands, but certain species occurred almost
   exclusively in perennial-flow sites. Two shrub-nesting species and the
   brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were most abundant in saltcedar
   shrub lands, and the brown-headed cowbird was most abundant in saltcedar
   stands with intermittent flows. Mesquite (Prosopis spp.) and big sacaton
   (Sporobolus wrightii) grassland each maintained the highest densities of
   certain species within >= 1 hydrologic regime. Shrub-nesting
   insectivores had the greatest nest survival in cottonwood, including
   Arizona Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii arizonae), and also had lower
   proportions of nests parasitized and preyed upon, although 95\%
   confidence intervals among vegetation types overlapped. Nest survival
   for both shrub-nesting insectivores and herbivores was lowest in
   intermittent-flow saltcedar, although, again, confidence intervals
   overlapped. Nest survival was lower in parasitized than nonparasitized
   nests in mesquite and across vegetation types for Arizona Bell's vireo
   and in cottonwood for Abert's towhee (Pipilo aberti). Riparian
   management that maintains heterogeneous riparian vegetation types,
   including floodplain vegetation comprising cottonwood-willow gallery
   riparian forests with some stretches of perennial flow, are important
   for maintaining the high diversity and abundance of breeding birds on
   the San Pedro River and probably across the region. Cottonwood stands
   also appear to maintain highest nest survival for some shrub-nesting
   birds.}},

Abstract = {{The fragmentation of natural habitat is considered to be a major threat
   to biodiversity. Decreasing habitat quality and quantity caused by
   fragmentation may lead to a disruption of plant-pollinator interactions
   and to a reduction in sexual reproduction in plant species. We conducted
   a 6-year field experiment to investigate the effects of small-scale
   fragmentation on plant-pollinator interactions and genetic diversity in
   the self-compatible Betonica officinalis. We examined the abundance and
   composition of pollinators, the foraging behaviour of bumblebees and the
   performance, outcrossing rate and genetic diversity of B. officinalis
   after 2 and 6 years in experimentally fragmented nutrient-poor,
   calcareous grassland in the northern Swiss Jura mountains. Fragments of
   different size (2.25 and 20.25 m(2)) were isolated by a 5-m-wide strip
   of frequently mown vegetation. Control plots of corresponding size were
   situated in adjacent undisturbed grassland. Experimental grassland
   fragmentation altered the composition of B. officinalis pollinators and
   reduced their flower visitation rate. Furthermore, the foraging
   behaviour of bumblebees was changed in the fragments. After 6 years of
   fragmentation seed weight was higher in fragments than in control plots.
   However, the densities of B. officinalis rosettes and inflorescences,
   plant height and inflorescence length were not affected by
   fragmentation. The outcrossing frequency of B. officinalis growing in
   fragments was reduced by 15\% after 2 years and by 33\% after 6 years of
   experimental fragmentation. This resulted in a significant reduction of
   the genetic diversity in seedlings emerging in fragments after 6 years.
   Our study shows that small-scale habitat fragmentation can disturb the
   interaction between B. officinalis and pollinators resulting in a
   reduced outcrossing frequency and genetic diversity in plants growing in
   fragments. However, the response to fragmentation was considerably
   delayed. This finding strengthens the claim for long-term field
   experiments with proper replications and controls to assess delayed
   effects of habitat fragmentation.}},

   significantly negatively correlated with saturated height, but not
   correlated with specific leaf area or seed size. We concluded that the

Abstract = {{The number of species-rich seminatural grasslands in Northern Europe has
   decreased significantly due to the abandonment of traditional land use
   practices. To preserve these habitats, an increasing number of abandoned
   and overgrown grasslands have been restored by cutting down trees and
   shrubs and reintroducing grazing. These practices are considered a
   useful tool to recover the species richness of vascular plants, but
   their impact on other taxa is hardly known. Here we studied ants as one
   important group of grassland insects. We investigated (1) the effects of
   restoration of nongrazed and afforested seminatural grasslands, compared
   to continuously managed reference sites; and (2) the modulating impacts
   of habitat characteristics and time elapsed since restoration. We found
   a total of 27 ant species, 11 of these were characteristic of open
   habitats and seven characteristic of forests. Neither species richness
   per site nor the number of open-habitat species, nor the number of
   forest species differed between restored and reference sites. Yet,
   within the restored sites, the total species richness and the number of
   open-habitat species was positively related to the time since
   restoration and the percentage of bare rock. High frequencies of most
   open-habitat species were associated with low vegetation, older restored
   sites, and reference sites. Most forest species showed their highest
   frequencies in tree- and shrub-dominated habitat. We conclude that
   restoration efforts have been successful in terms of retrieving species
   richness. A regular and moderate grazing regime subsequent to the

Abstract = {{High biodiversity of Estonian semi-natural grasslands can only be
   maintained through continuous management. One option for the usage of
   biomass from these areas is bioenergy production, if both the herbaceous
   biomass yield and the chemical characteristics of the cut meet the
   needs. In 2007 the largest average annual biomass yield per area was
   achieved in floodplain meadows (5.7 t dry mass/ha), which also have the
   highest potential for biomass production among Estonian semi-natural
   grasslands (more than 113,000 t dry mass). The area of mesic meadows is
   larger, but due to lower average yield per area (2.5 t dry mass/ha), the
   potential of this meadow type was less than half of that of floodplain
   meadows (53,000 t dry mass). The corresponding numbers for wooded
   meadows were 1.6 t dry mass/ha and 12,000 t dry mass, respectively.
   Chemical characteristics of herbaceous biomass from wooded meadows
   significantly differed from mesic and floodplain meadows, giving the
   highest values of Ca, K, Mg, crude protein and ash (1.3\%, 2.4\%, 0.3\%,
   10.9\% and 9.5\% of the dry biomass, respectively). The energetic value
   of the biomass from different meadow types varied between 18.1 kJ/g and

   Standardized interviews with farmers assessed agricultural practices in

   Species richness, abundance and diversity of wild bees were greater in
   sites turned towards crop production. In these sites, flowering crops
   provided abundant food resources for bees whereas, in the other group of

Abstract = {{The socio-economic changes of the last decades have resulted in changes
   in traditional land uses with consequent abandonment of large farmland
   areas in the Mediterranean region. We assessed the response of species
   richness and composition, and species functional traits to decreasing
   land use intensity in a Montado system, an agro-pastoral system
   characteristic of the Alentejo, Southern Portugal. Additionally, we
   investigated whether plant functional types can be established based on
   the response to decreasing land use intensity in these systems.
   Consistent with previous studies, species richness decreased sharply
   after land abandonment, and this was associated with a strong turnover
   in species composition from grazed to abandoned sites as the vegetation
   changed from herbaceous to shrub dominated communities. Pronounced
   differences in functional traits were found for different successional
   stages. Therophyte life form, short plant height, high specific leaf
   area (SLA), low leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and small seeds with
   dispersal structures were dominant in grazed plots. Within abandoned
   plots, chamaephytes dominated in plots abandoned for 10-15 years and
   decreased in favour of nanophanerophytes in plots abandoned for 20-30
   years. Plant height, LDMC and seed mass increased with abandonment time
   while SLA decreased. Functional response groups sufficient to describe
   vegetation change were identified combining life form and SLA.
   Therophytes with medium SLA were the dominant functional group in grazed
   areas, while nanophanerophytes with medium or low SLA were associated
   with later phases of abandonment. At intermediate stages of succession
   the dominant group was chamaephytes with medium SLA but functional
   diversity was highest as all the groups, except hemicryptophytes with
   medium SLA, were represented. These changes in functional composition
   can be translated into effects on key ecosystem properties. The increase
   in LDMC indicates an increase in flammability while trends in both LDMC
   and SLA suggest decreased decomposition, and thereby carbon and nutrient
   cycling. These will need to be considered in combination with
   consequences for other ecosystem properties for future management. (C)

   few decades. In Chile's Aysen region, grazing in remnant forests is
   common practice but there is little empirical evidence of
   tree-understorey interactions therein. In an attempt to establish a
   scientific basis for silvopastoral implementation, the relationship
   between lenga cover and grassland productivity, quality and species
   richness was examined. Tree cover was quantified in 14 (20 x 20 m) sites
   where aboveground herbaceous biomass was evaluated monthly throughout
   two growing seasons. Herbage quality and plant species richness were
   measured once at the peak of biomass production in the second year. We
   discuss radiation transmitted through the canopy and water supply as
   drivers of the tree-understorey relationship. Changes in herbaceous
   species composition and richness with varying tree cover are described.
   Despite interannual differences, scattered trees or medium-density
   forests allow higher productivity than open areas, as well as an
   acceptable nutritive value and preservation of native species. Although
   further studies are required, our results suggest that presence of lenga
   trees within grazing areas can be an advantageous alternative in terms

   dung were compared with those present in the local species pool.
   Results
   Seventy-two plant species from 23 plant families had viable seeds in
   sheep dung. The plant families encountered most frequently were
   Gramineae and Compositae. The most abundant and frequently recorded
   plant species in dung samples was Urtica dioica, accounting for > 80\%
   of the total number of seeds. Mean seed density in sheep dung was 0.8
   seeds g-1 dry matter. Seeds with low seed mass and a high seed longevity
   index were over-represented in dung. Viable seeds > 2.5 mg were
   infrequent in the dung samples.
   Conclusions
   We conclude that sheep are potentially important dispersers of plant
   species in Dutch calcareous grasslands. Although smaller seeds were
   relatively abundant in sheep dung, it cannot be excluded that this was
   mainly caused by differences in seed abundance.}},

Abstract = {{Question
   Can we reliably estimate grazing intensity, indicators of grazing
   intensity (i.e. field-layer height and shrub-cover), and vascular plant
   species richness in semi-natural grasslands from high spatial resolution
   satellite data?
   Location
   The Baltic Island of Oland (Sweden).
   Methods
   Fieldwork included the on-site description of grazed and ungrazed areas
   and shrub-cover within 107 semi-natural grassland sites. Field-layer
   height and vascular plant species richness (total within-site and mean
   small-scale species richness) were recorded within the sites. Digital
   classification of QuickBird data was performed to identify grazed and
   ungrazed areas and shrub-cover. Vegetation indices were generated to
   analyze the performance of satellite data for estimating field-layer
   height, and the spectral heterogeneity was used to characterize the
   within-site environmental heterogeneity.
   Results
   The proportion of digitally classified grazed area explained 45\% of the
   variation in field-layer height and 43\% of the variation in
   shrub-cover. Field-layer height was significantly related to vegetation
   indices. A linear model with three explanatory variables (spectral
   richness(red), spectral richness(NIR), and shrub-cover) explained 47\%
   of the variation in total within-site species richness.
   Conclusions
   High spatial resolution imagery may assist in the monitoring of the
   processes that follow the cessation of grazing, on the scale of
   individual grassland sites. Measures of spectral heterogeneity acquired
   by high spatial resolution imagery can be used in the assessment of
   total within-site vascular plant species richness in semi-natural
   grassland vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Native grasslands are among the most imperiled of the North American
   ecosystems, with only similar to 4\% of their pre-settlement area
   remaining, but some grassland habitats are being restored and maintained
   through such methods as prescribed burning and mowing, which may provide
   habitat for animal species endemic to this ecosystem. I determined how
   succession of the plant community, due to a four-year rotational burn in
   16 grassland fragments, influenced species richness and local abundances
   of small mammals in Illinois, USA. Species richness was relatively low
   in grasslands that were recently burned and highest in older
   successional grasslands. The most abundant species, Microtus
   ochrogaster, M. pennslyvanicus, Peromyscus maniculatus, P. leucopus, and
   Reithrodontomys megalotis showed very different responses to succession;
   Microtus spp. were most abundant in older successional grasslands,
   preferring areas with more cover of bunch-grasses, whereas the other
   three species were relatively abundant in grasslands of all successional
   ages. P. maniculatus was most abundant in any habitat that had ample
   open ground. The grasslands at my study site are a mixture of restored
   and non-restored grasslands. Overall, adding additional time between
   burns and restoring more of the grasslands by planting bunchgrasses that
   are native to this area may increase abundances of most mammal species
   at my study site.}},

   lower bird spedes richness and a lower number of breeding pairs than
   meadows in which goldenrods were absent (n = 15) Two important factors

   observed slightly higher population growth rates in pastures than in

   demonstrating a management-induced negative correlation Such negative
   correlations may reflect species' adaptability to environment changes,

Abstract = {{Rare plants and their habitats are integral to the conservation of
   biodiversity in many areas. With increasing habitat destruction and
   fragmentation, there is an urgent need to identify elements of diversity
   that are at risk, to adequately address conservation priorities, and
   successfully implement management strategies. In this research project,
   plant species rarity in rock outcrop ecosystems occurring on the Gulf
   Islands in southwestern British Columbia was examined at 13 study sites
   (3000 m(2) area examined per site). Bryophytes comprised the largest
   portion of rare taxa; 18 of the 20 provincially rare taxa were mosses,
   including two species new to Canada. Challenges facing rare plant
   species conservation were considered from a landscape management
   perspective. Rock outcrops represent non-equilibrial, primary
   successional systems; some form of perpetual large-scale disturbance (e.
   g., climate and (or) grazing) may be integral to maintaining these
   ecosystems, their constituent habitats, and the occurrence of many rare
   moss species. In contrast with vascular plants, which are of focal
   concern in relatively deeper-soiled Garry oak meadows (i. e., native
   herbs and grasses), bryophytes have limited competitive ability. As
   such, the rare bryophytes of rock outcrop ecosystems are likely to be
   highly sensitive to successional development within sites (i. e.,
   factors reducing the availability of early successional habitats) that
   may arise through land use modifications and (or) changes in local
   climatic conditions related to global warming.}},

Abstract = {{2. We tested how activity density and species richness of carabid
   trophic groups responded to local habitat and landscape structure
   (forest percentage cover and habitat richness) in 48 landscape parcels

   3. Local habitat affected activity density, but not species richness, of
   both trophic groups. Activity densities were greater in rotational
   cropping compared with other habitats; phytophage densities were also
   greater in grassland than forest habitats.
   4. Controlling for country and habitat effects, we found general trophic
   group responses to landscape structure. Activity densities of
   phytophages were positively correlated, and zoophages uncorrelated, with
   increasing habitat richness. This differential functional group response
   to landscape structure was consistent across Europe, indicated by a lack
   of a country x habitat richness interaction. Species richness was
   unaffected by landscape structure.
   5. Phytophage sensitivity to landscape structure may arise from relative
   dependency on seed from ruderal plants. This trophic adaptation, rare in
   Carabidae, leads to lower phytophage numbers, increasing vulnerability
   to demographic and stochastic processes that the greater abundance,

Abstract = {{Many studies have evaluated the effect of forest fragmentation on dung
   beetle assemblage structure. However, few have analyzed how forest
   fragmentation affects the processes carried out by these insects in
   tropical forests where their food sources consist mainly of dung
   produced by native herbivore mammals. With the conversion of forests to
   pastures, cattle dung has become an exotic alternative and abundant food
   for dung beetles. This study compares dung removal rates of native
   (monkey) and exotic (cow) dung in different-sized fragments of tropical
   rain forests, during the dry and rainy seasons at the Los Tuxtlas
   Biosphere Reserve. Dung removal rates were affected by season, dung
   type, and the interaction between resource type and season. During the
   dry season, the removal rates of monkey dung were somewhat similar than
   during the rainy season, whereas the removal rates of cow dung were much
   higher during the rainy season. Dung beetle biomass and species richness
   were almost three times greater in monkey dung than in cow dung. Monkey
   dung attracted species belonging to the dweller, roller, and tunneler
   guilds; cow dung attracted mostly tunnelers. Therefore, the use of
   exotic dung may result in a biased misconception of the rates of dung
   removal in tropical forest and an underestimation of dung beetle
   diversity. This study highlights the importance of working with natural
   tropical forest resources when attempting to identify realistic

Abstract = {{As many other birds breeding in agricultural areas, the common redstart
   declined strongly in many Central European countries over the last 60
   years. The destruction of traditionally managed orchards, an important
   breeding habitat in Central Europe, is a relevant cause. An additional
   factor for the decline of this species could be the intensified
   management of the ground vegetation in orchards through reducing food
   availability and lowering prey detectability and accessibility. In this
   study we examined the importance of surfaces with sparse vegetation for
   the location of redstart territories and for foraging. To validate the
   results of these field studies we made habitat-choice experiments in
   aviaries with captive birds. Territories occupied by redstarts in
   orchards of northwestern Switzerland contained a significantly higher
   proportion of surfaces with sparse vegetation than unoccupied control
   sites. Redstarts made almost five times more hunting flights into
   experimentally established ruderal vegetation strips than into adjacent
   unmown meadows. No difference was observed when the meadow was freshly
   mown. Vegetation height and the proportion of open ground surface
   correctly predicted the vegetation type for hunting in 77\% of the
   cases. Experiments in aviaries offering two types of sparse vegetation
   and a dense meadow supported the results of the field experiments. Even
   a four-fold increase of the food abundance in the meadow did not lead to
   a noticeable change in preference for the sparse vegetation types. For
   the conservation of the common redstart, not only traditionally managed
   orchards with tall trees with cavities should be preserved but also
   areas with sparse vegetation should be favored.}},

Abstract = {{The increase of anthropogenic activities has severely altered both
   terrestrial and aquatic systems. Urbanisation, excessive use of
   agricultural fertilisers, organic runoff and climate change have caused
   an increase of nutrients in coastal waters, altering the diversity and
   food-web structure of benthic assemblages. The aims of the present paper
   were to text if an experimentally increased availability of nutrients,
   primarily nitrogen and phosphorous, in an oligotrophic basin, would
   affect epiphytic assemblages on leaves and rhizomes of P. oceanica and
   whether this could change rates of consumption of the plant by
   herbivores. In particular, we tested the hypothesis i) that changes to
   species composition and abundance of epiphytic assemblages generated by
   nutrients enrichment would vary between leaves and rhizomes and that ii)
   alterations to epiphytic assemblages on leaves might, in turn, modify
   feeding rates of herbivorous fish. After two years, the structure of
   both leaf and rhizome epiphytic assemblages responded to changes in
   nutrient concentrations before the occurrence of drastic alterations to
   the host plant, but only the former showed significant changes in terms
   of species composition. Moreover, a larger intensity of grazing on P.
   oceanica leaves was documented in experimentally enriched areas than in
   controls. The present findings and conclusions are applicable to other
   systems where patterns of biodiversity depend on changes in the
   availability of nutrients due to natural or anthropogenic events, likely
   interacting with biological processes, such as competition and grazing.

Abstract = {{Grazing by large herbivores has the potential to facilitate invasion of

   grasslands occupy poor soils and have higher plant species diversity
   compared to tall-tussock grasslands which typically grow on rich soils.
   Part of the study area is devoted to cattle husbandry, part is inhabited
   by feral horses, and part has been free of grazing by large herbivores
   for the last 15 years. We compared non-native species richness and cover
   at three levels of grazing (horse grazing, cattle grazing, grazing
   exclusion) and two levels of plant community type (short-needlegrass
   grassland and tall-tussock grassland) at the end of the growing season
   in 2006 and 2007. Thirty-one non-native plant species were found growing
   in the study area. Grazing increased non-native species richness and
   cover and was highest under horse grazing and in communities on
   resource-rich soils. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that
   grazing by large non-native herbivores can facilitate non-native plant
   species invasion of natural grasslands. They also suggest that herbivore
   identity and community type modulate the effect of large herbivore
   grazing on grassland invasion by non-native plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Resident diversity and resource enrichment are both recognized as
   potentially important determinants of community invasibility, but the
   effects of these biotic and abiotic factors on invasions are often
   investigated separately, and little work has been done to directly
   compare their relative effects or to examine their potential
   interactions. Here, we evaluate the individual and interactive effects
   of resident diversity and resource enrichment on plant community
   resistance to invasion. We factorially manipulated plant diversity and
   the enrichment of belowground (soil nitrogen) and aboveground (light)
   resources in low-fertility grassland communities invaded by Lolium
   arundinaceum, the most abundant invasive grass in eastern North America.
   Soil nitrogen enrichment enhanced L. arundinaceum performance, but
   increased resident diversity dampened this effect of nitrogen
   enrichment. Increased light availability (via clipping of aboveground
   vegetation) had a negligible effect on community invasibility. These
   results demonstrate that a community's susceptibility to invasion can be
   contingent upon the type of resource pulse and the diversity of resident
   species. In order to assess the generality of these results, future
   studies that test the effects of resident diversity and resource
   enrichment against a range of invasive species and in other
   environmental contexts (e.g., sites differing in soil fertility and
   light regimes) are needed. Such studies may help to resolve conflicting
   interpretations of the diversity-invasibility relationship and provide
   direction for management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing with livestock is a common feature of nature and rangeland
   management. Although both aim at different, seemingly opposing goals,
   i.e. maintenance of biodiversity values versus maximization of animal
   production, they nonetheless have a common interest in maintaining the
   rangeland or natural environment in a state that ensures either the
   first or the second goal. In order to accomplish an effective and
   efficient grazing management, in terms of grazer density, grazer
   composition, grazing seasonality, and to prevent under- and overgrazing,
   a grazing capacity model (GCM) was developed, that should be applicable
   in both rangeland and nature conservation management conditions and that
   takes spatio-temporal environmental variation into account. This
   spatio-temporally dynamic model considers crucial variables at both the
   terrain and the grazer level, such as (seasonally) fluctuating forage
   yield, forage quality, plant palatability, accessibility of the area,
   soil erosion vulnerability, animal nutritive requirements, animal
   behaviour and general habitat condition. It predicts the optimal grazer
   species and density, taking into account the seasonal variation in
   animal needs and fluctuating terrain characteristics. A sensitivity
   analysis was conducted to define each parameter's relative impact on the
   final outcome of the model.
   We present the GCM outline and illustrate the functionality of this
   model for Shetland ponies and Highland cattle, grazing in a temperate
   coastal dune environment. According to the model, seasonal fluctuations
   in optimal grazer densities occur: the area can support higher densities
   in summer and autumn than it can during winter and spring. With the
   current density of grazing animals and the choice for year-round grazing
   at non-fluctuating animal densities, the model consequently predicts
   overgrazing in winter and undergrazing in summer and autumn. Both
   undergrazing and overgrazing scenarios might lead to non-sustainable
   situations in the future. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Soil carbon sequestration (enhanced sinks) is the mechanism responsible
   for most of the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potential in the
   agriculture sector Carbon sequestration in grasslands can be determined
   directly by measuring changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and
   indirectly by measuring the net balance of C fluxes. A literature search
   shows that grassland C sequestration reaches on average 5 +/- 30g C/m(2)
   per year according to inventories of SOC stocks and -231 and 77g C/m(2)
   per year for drained organic and mineral soils, respectively, according
   to C flux balance. Off-site C sequestration occurs whenever more manure
   C is produced by than returned to a grassland plot The sum of on- and
   off-site C sequestration reaches 129, 98 and 71g C/m(2) per year for
   grazed, cut and mixed European grasslands on mineral soils,
   respectively, however with high uncertainty. A range of management
   practices reduce C losses and increase C sequestration: (i) avoiding
   soil tillage and the conversion of grasslands to arable use, (ii)
   moderately intensifying nutrient-poor permanent grasslands, (iii) using
   light grazing instead of heavy grazing, (iv) increasing the duration of
   grass leys; (v) converting grass leys to grass-legume mixtures or to
   permanent grasslands. With nine European sites, direct emissions of N2O
   from soil and of CH4 from enteric fermentation at grazing, expressed in
   CO2 equivalents, compensated 10\% and 34\% of the on-site grassland C
   sequestration, respectively. Digestion inside the barn of the harvested
   herbage leads to further emissions of CH4 and N2O by the production
   systems, which were estimated at 130g CO2 equivalents/m(2) per year The
   net balance of on- and off-site C sequestration, CH4 and N2O emissions
   reached 38g CO2 equivalents/m(2) per year, indicating a non-significant
   net sink activity. This net balance was, however, negative for
   intensively managed cut sites indicating a source to the atmosphere. In
   conclusion, this review confirms that grassland C sequestration has a
   strong potential to partly mitigate the GHG balance of ruminant
   production systems. However as soil C sequestration is both reversible
   and vulnerable to disturbance, biodiversity loss and climate change, CH4
   and N2O emissions from the livestock sector need to be reduced and
   current SOC stocks preserved.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration of managed landscapes is critical for the conservation of
   biodiversity and function at a landscape scale. We tested effects of
   revegetation of grazing land formerly vegetated by eucalyptus woodland
   on trophic groups of epigaeic beetles, considering a restoration
   chronosequence (space-for-time substitution). We used paddocks (i.e.
   grazed pastures) as the start point, sites in two age classes (5-8 and
   12-17 since years since replanting) and fenced woodland remnants to
   represent the desired end point. Phytophages were most common in young
   revegetated sites, which had reduced grazing pressure and low canopy
   cover. Assemblage composition of both saprophages and predators
   converged on those of remnants over ``time{''}. Paddock sites had the
   lowest species evenness of saprophages, with two species being
   particularly common. Saprophage assemblages in paddocks were also more
   homogeneous than those in other site types i.e. between site variation
   in assemblage composition was low. Predators were smaller but more
   species-rich in sites with less coarse woody debris, canopy cover and
   litter, possibly responding to higher abundances of small prey. Beetle
   biomass did not differ across habitats. For saprophages, a greater
   abundance in paddocks was counterbalanced by reduced body size. Remnants
   did not support a significantly greater proportion of habitat-specific
   species. However, more species than expected were specific to treed
   sites. Our study supports previous findings that habitat structure is a
   key driver of beetle community restoration. It also suggests that
   epigaeic assemblages respond relatively rapidly to revegetation,
   probably because they do not require resources that develop over long
   periods of time. The similarities in biomass for all trophic groups
   across sites suggest that beetle-performed functions may operate
   similarly in different stages, reflecting high functional resilience of
   epigaeic beetle assemblages in this landscape. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of sowing low-diversity seed mixtures (containing

   croplands previously used as alfalfa fields. In four permanent plots in
   10 restored fields (four with alkali and six with loess seed mixture)
   the cover of flowering plants was recorded and phytomass was measured
   between 2006 and 2008. We asked three questions: (i) How fast will
   weedy, short-lived species decrease in abundance during secondary
   succession enhanced by sowing low-diversity seed mixtures? (ii) Can
   weeds be suppressed by sowing competitive native grasses, followed up by
   management by mowing? (iii) Can succession towards the target native
   grasslands be accelerated by sowing only low-diversity seed mixtures
   compared to set-aside old field succession? Our results showed that in
   just two years a vegetation dominated by perennial grasses has
   developed, which successfully prevented the establishment of weed
   species. These results suggested that sowing seeds of two or three
   competitive grass species is an effective tool to eliminate weed
   domination and to lead towards the restoration of species poor
   grasslands with grass domination such as alkali grasslands. However, the
   developed dense perennial grass cover and the accumulated litter may
   hamper the immigration of specialist species characteristic to reference
   grasslands. Therefore, the restoration of species-rich grasslands
   requires the facilitation of the immigration of grassland specialist
   species by further management (grazing, mowing and/or hay-transport).

Abstract = {{Large herbivores and topo-edaphic gradients are well-documented, major
   determinants of grassland plant production and species composition. In
   contrast, there is limited information about how these factors together
   may influence the composition of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF)
   communities associated with plants. AMF are a common component of
   grassland ecosystems where they can influence plant productivity,
   diversity, and soil stability. In this study, AMF community composition
   was analyzed in paired plots located inside and outside 40-44-year-old
   ungulate exclosures at six grassland sites in Yellowstone National Park
   (YNP), USA, that varied in soil moisture and the availability of soil
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P). AMF spore abundance, species richness,
   and the relative abundance of AMF species were determined from soil
   samples collected (1) randomly (n = 5 samples) within each of the 12
   plots and (2) from beneath the dominant grass (n = 5 samples per plot)
   at each site. Randomly collected soil samples explored the effects of
   ungulates and topographic position on AM F composition at the plant
   community level, subsuming potential effects of ungulates on plant
   species composition. Dominant plant samples examined how grazers, in
   particular, influenced AMF communities, while controlling or host-plant
   identity. Grazing decreased AMF spore abundance across the landscape
   (examined by random sampling) but increased the AM F species richness
   associated with dominant plants. Grazing influenced the AMF species
   composition at the plant community level and at the host-plant level by
   shifting the relative abundances of individual AMF species. Individual
   AMF species responded differently to grazing and N and P availability.
   Our results demonstrate how soil moisture and N and P availability

Abstract = {{Abiotic soil properties, plant community composition, and herbivory all
   have been reported as important factors influencing the composition of
   soil communities. However, most studies thus far have considered these
   factors in isolation, whereas they strongly interact in the field. Here,
   we study how grazing by vertebrate herbivores influences the soil
   nematode community composition of a floodplain grassland while we
   account for effects of grazing on plant community composition and
   abiotic soil properties. Nematodes are the most ubiquitous invertebrates
   in the soil. They include a variety of feeding types, ranging from
   microbial feeders to herbivores and carnivores, and they perform key
   functions in soil food webs.
   Our hypothesis was that grazing affects nematode community structure and
   composition through altering plant community structure and composition.
   Alternatively, we tested whether the effects of grazing may, directly or
   indirectly, run via changes in soil abiotic properties. We used a
   long-term field experiment containing plots with and without vertebrate
   grazers (cattle and rabbits). We compared plant and nematode community
   structure and composition, as well as a number of key soil abiotic
   properties, and we applied structural equation modeling to investigate
   four possible pathways by which grazing may change nematode community
   composition.
   Aboveground grazing increased plant species richness and reduced both
   plant and nematode community heterogeneity. There was a positive
   relationship between plant and nematode diversity indices. Grazing
   decreased the number of bacterial-feeding nematodes, indicating that in
   these grasslands, top-down control of plant production by grazing leads
   to bottom-up control in the basal part of the bacterial channel of the
   soil food web.
   According to the structural equation model, grazing had a strong effect
   on soil abiotic properties and plant community composition, whereas
   plant community composition was the main determinant of nematode
   community composition. Other pathways, which assumed that grazing
   influenced nematode community composition by inducing changes in soil
   abiotic properties, did not significantly explain variation in nematode
   community composition.
   We conclude that grazing-induced changes in nematode community
   composition mainly operated via changes in plant community composition.
   Influences of vertebrate grazers on soil nematodes through modification
   of abiotic soil properties were of less importance.}},

Abstract = {{Precipitation variability and shrub encroachment in response to global
   environmental change are likely to affect both richness and aboveground
   net primary production (ANPP) of annual plants in arid and semi-arid
   ecosystems in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, especially given the
   grazing history and desertification potential of this aridland region.
   Using a nine-year dataset (1999-2007), we examined the spatial and
   temporal variation in annual plant communities in grass- and
   shrub-dominated vegetation, and evaluated the relationships between
   species richness and ANPP with seasonal and annual precipitation and
   soil moisture. We found that species richness and ANPP varied among
   seasons and between years in both grass- and shrub-dominated areas.
   Cryptantha crassisepala, Plantago patagonica, and Phacelia integrifolia
   Were the most common species found in both communities in both seasons,
   and Chamaesyce serrula, C. serpyllifolia, arid Kallstroemia parviflora
   were more common in summer only.
   We found that species richness in summer was significantly correlated
   with summer precipitation and summer soil moisture in both communities,
   but summer ANPP was significantly correlated with summer precipitation
   and soil moisture only in shrubland. However, richness and ANPP of
   winter annuals were significantly correlated with winter precipitation
   and winter soil moisture in shrubland and grassland. Our results
   demonstrate that temporal variation in rainfall can be as important as
   annual total amounts for plant performance, and that response to
   temporal dynamics varies among species but not between grass- and
   shrub-dominated communities. We conclude that desert annuals provide a
   highly dynamic system for understanding the processes that influence
   plant species composition and abundance, and that desert annual systems
   will likely be highly impacted by shrub encroachment along with
   increases in precipitation variability as a consequence of anthropogenic
   climate change. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A short visit to the Bayanbuluk Grassland in the Tianshan Mountains,
   Xinjiang, PRC, revealed a number of environmental and livestock
   production problems, including grassland degradation, loss of grassland
   biodiversity, soil erosion and flash flooding downstream, decreased
   pasture productivity, and poor livestock nutrition (especially in
   winter) leading to stock losses and flocks and herds of low
   productivity. This paper describes those problems and then suggests some
   solutions. Short duration, high intensity grazing could be one of the
   solutions to both improving grassland condition and improving livestock
   nutrition. Local production of fodder crops for feeding in winter and
   spring deserves testing, using adapted strains of Alfalfa (Medicago
   sativa) and trialling fodder root crop production. It is important to
   realise that the land management objectives of scientists,
   administrators, herders and farmers may be similar, and that there are
   opportunities for land improvement through working together.}},

Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{498-508}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{1. Both top-down and bottom-up influences, such as grazing herbivores
   and edaphic factors, may maintain species-rich vegetation by preventing
   dominant plants from reducing diversity. However, the interaction
   between grazing and other processes maintaining diversity, particularly
   in ecosystems with multiple herbivores, is poorly understood. We
   manipulated access by small and large vertebrate herbivores on an
   edaphically heterogeneous site. We investigated whether: (i) grazing and
   soil properties interacted in their impact on vegetation, (ii) the
   effects of herbivores on different plant functional groups depended on
   soil properties, and (iii) small and large herbivores were functionally
   equivalent.
   2. Treatments allowed mixed rabbit and livestock grazing, rabbit grazing
   only or no grazing and were replicated within three areas differing in
   vegetation, soil nutrient availability and pH. Soil properties, plant
   species composition, vegetation height and above- and below-ground
   biomass were measured after 6 years.
   3. Bottom-up and top-down impacts were both important, with soil
   properties and grazing explaining 42.1\% and 9.2\% of the variability in
   species composition between plots, respectively. Grazing enhanced the
   impact of soil properties on the plant community by preventing dominance
   by Ulex europaeus and maintaining differences in species composition
   between the areas.
   4. Grazing consistently increased species richness across vegetation
   types, but the responses of different plant functional groups depended
   on area. For instance, grazing removal caused graminoid abundance to
   increase in the area where grasses were the dominant functional group,
   but to decrease in other areas.
   5. Small herbivores (rabbits) were only partially functionally
   equivalent to larger grazing herbivores (livestock), as rabbit grazing
   pressure did not increase in plots ungrazed by large herbivores. The
   results suggested a facilitative relationship between large and small
   herbivores, with large herbivores improving forage quality and
   increasing access to plots by rabbits.
   6. Synthesis. (i) Grazing and soil properties interacted in their impact
   on the composition and diversity of vegetation, (ii) the effects of
   herbivores on particular plant functional groups depended on the
   characteristics of the area, and (iii) small and large herbivores were
   not functionally equivalent, with small vertebrate herbivores unable to
   replace the impact of larger herbivores when these were removed.}},

Abstract = {{Monoculture and mixed pastures in Florida provide habitat for a variety
   of resident and migratory bird species. The objectives of this Study
   were to investigate the effects of grazing on vegetation structure and
   bird species richness and abundance in grazed monoculture and mixed
   pastures. Study pasture units were subject to four cattle grazing
   intensities: 0 = nongrazed (control), 15 = low, 20 = medium, or 35 =
   high animal units (AU) per pasture unit (no cattle, 1.3, 1.0, and 0.6 ha
   . AU(-1), on monoculture pastures and no cattle, 2.1, 1.6, and 0.9 ha .
   AU(-1), on mixed pastures). Monoculture pastures displayed a greater
   decrease in spatial heterogeneity of the vegetative community in the
   presence of grazing than mixed pastures. All increase in grazing
   intensity led to declines in total avian species richness and abundance
   and species richness within short-distance migrant, neotropical migrant,
   and permanent resident guilds oil monoculture pastures. Declines in
   total species richness and abundance and neotropical migrant guild
   species richness and abundance were observed on mixed pastures subject
   to increasing grazing intensity. However, species richness within
   short-distance migrant and urban guilds and abundance within the
   grassland guild increased on this pasture type in the presence of
   grazing. Loss of spatial heterogeneity typically results in a lack of
   suitable habitat for birds that occupy the extremes of the vegetation
   structure gradient. This can lead to a loss of species richness and
   abundance. For the majority of avian guilds, a low grazing intensity of
   1.3 ha . AU(-1) and 2.1 ha . AU(-1) on monoculture and mixed pasture,
   respectively, is recommended to maintain abundance. However, these
   grazing intensities may result in declines in species richness.
   Ultimately, if a range of avian species are to be supported on
   monoculture and mixed pastures, spatial heterogeneity of plant structure
   and composition must be maintained.}},

Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Sand shinnery oak (Quercus havardii) communities are a unique component
   of grassland bird habitat in eastern New Mexico and have been impacted
   by human activities for decades. These communities are frequently
   managed with livestock grazing and herbicide application for shrub
   control, strategies that potentially can be used to restore the
   historical shrub-grass composition of this plant community. During
   spring migration and the breeding seasons of 2004 and 2005, we compared
   density and community structure of grassland bird species among four
   combinations of tebuthiuron application and grazing treatments that were
   being evaluated for restoration of shinnery oak communities. We
   performed biweekly point transects on sixteen 65-ha study plots in these
   communities. Density of all avian species combined did not differ
   between grazed and ungrazed plots. Tebuthiuron-treated plots had a 40\%
   higher average density for combined species than untreated plots. There
   was a 41\% higher average density of all species during spring 2005 than
   2004, but density was similar during the breeding season of both years.
   These trends were predominantly influenced by densities of migratory
   Cassin's Sparrow (Aimophila cassinii), which were greater in
   tebuthiuron-treated plots in both years. Densities of resident
   Meadowlarks (Sturnella spp.) exhibited little response to tebuthiuron or
   grazing treatments. Avian species richness, evenness, and diversity were
   only minimally affected by the tebuthiuron and grazing treatments. This
   study occurred over a period of highly variable precipitation, so future
   assessments, spanning longer wet-dry cycles and maturing plant
   communities, may be necessary to completely determine avian response to
   these restoration efforts.}},

Abstract = {{It is now widely accepted that agricultural intensification drives the
   decline of biodiversity and related ecosystem services like pollination.
   Conservation management, such as agri-environment schemes (AES), has
   been introduced to Counteract these declines, but in Western European
   countries these tend to produce mixed biodiversity benefits. Not much is
   known about the effects of AES in Central and Eastern European
   Countries. We evaluated the effect of reduced stocking rates (0.5 cow/ha
   vs. >1 cow/ha) on bees and insect-pollinated plants in semi-natural
   pastures in Hungary. We sampled bees using sweep net and transect
   surveys in the edge and interior of the fields three times in 2003. On
   the same transects, we also estimated the cover of all plant species. We
   found no management effect on species richness and abundance with
   respect to cover of bees and insect-pollinated plants, but grazing
   intensity resulted in differences in species composition of
   insect-pollinated plants. Furthermore, we compared our results with
   those of a similar study carried out in Switzerland, and the
   Netherlands, but with different management regimes. There were positive
   effects of management in Switzerland, but conservation effects were
   lacking in the Netherlands. Species richness of both bees and
   insect-pollinated plants was highest in Hungary, intermediate in
   Switzerland and lowest in the Netherlands. Across all countries, the
   richness of insect-pollinated plants was a good predictor of bee species
   richness. Grassland extensification schemes were effective for bees and
   insect-pollinated plants in the country with intermediate land-Use,
   intensity and biodiversity only (Switzerland). The absence of effects in
   the Netherlands may have been caused by the management being highly
   intensive on both field types. In Hungarian grasslands biodiversity
   levels were high regardless of management and both investigated stocking
   rates may be qualified as conservation management. Therefore,
   agricultural policy in Hungary should encourage the maintenance of a
   variety of traditional grazing practices for conserving this still
   highly diverse pollinator fauna. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Question: Can long-term grazing management maintain and restore
   species-rich sand dune plant communities within a sand dune site of high
   conservation interest?
   Location: Newborough Warren, North Wales, UK.
   Methods: Vegetation changes that occurred between 1987 and 2003,
   subsequent to grazing by domestic livestock being introduced to the site
   after decades with little or no stock grazing, were analysed using data
   collected from permanent monitoring quadrats over a 16-year period.
   Results: At the plant community level, grazing brought about a shift
   from a tall-grass dominated, species-poor community to a more
   species-rich community in the dry dunes, but did not change community
   type in dune slacks. However, at the species level, grazing enhanced the
   abundance of some desired perennial, annual and biennial species,
   graminoids and bryophytes in both habitat types. The increased frequency
   of positive indicator species for habitat condition suggests that
   grazing was beneficial for species of conservation interest. Ellenberg
   nitrogen (N) values decreased after grazing in dry habitats but showed
   no long-term change independent of grazing, suggesting no increase in
   site fertility over the study period. Surprisingly, light (L) values
   also decreased in the dry dunes after grazing.
   Conclusions: Long-term grazing management can play an important role for
   the conservation of dune communities and associated species. Because of
   its positive effects on species diversity, plant communities and habitat
   condition in sand dunes, livestock grazing is recommended for
   conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{The accumulation of biomass and of dead plant remains is a direct
   consequence of grassland abandonment. Litter can occupy potential
   microsites for seed germination and seedling establishment, and thus
   decrease species diversity in the long-term. This effect can be more
   accentuated in dry grassland of open structure where species are adapted
   to excessive light and bare surfaces during the recruitment phase. We
   conducted a field experiment with litter removal alone or in combination
   with vegetation cutting and studied germination and seedling survival
   during 2 years in two abandoned steppe sites. With our experimental
   treatments we intended to create microsites and to activate the seed
   bank, with the aim to enhance recruitment of dry-grassland species;
   potentially also those already absent from the established vegetation.
   Our results show, that while both treatments significantly increased
   recruitment by enhancing seed germination in the first year of the
   study, only litter removal combined with vegetation cutting
   significantly promoted seedling survival during both years. Our
   experiment demonstrated that even after 40 years of abandonment the
   applied measures favoured the re-emergence of target species that were
   very rare or absent from the above-ground vegetation of continental
   steppe-like grassland. Thus, management prescriptions which comprise
   removal of dead and even living biomass, such as mowing or grazing, are
   considered beneficial for this habitat type of high nature conservation

Abstract = {{With our enhanced understanding of the factors that determine
   biodiversity and assemblage structure has come increasing acknowledgment
   that the use of an appropriate disturbance regime to maintain spatial
   heterogeneity is an effective conservation technique. A herbivore's
   behavior affects its disturbance regime (size and intensity); this, in
   turn, may modify the associated spatial heterogeneity of plants and soil
   properties. We examined whether the pattern of spatial disturbance
   created by the Siberian marmot (Marmota sibirica) affects the spatial
   heterogeneity of vegetation and soils at a colony scale on the Mongolian
   steppe. We expected that the difference in management between two types
   of area (protection against hunting marmots vs. hunting allowed) would
   result in different behavioral patterns; therefore, we estimated the
   patterns of spatial disturbance separately in protected and unprotected
   areas. We then surveyed plant communities and soil nutrients in these
   areas to assess their spatial heterogeneity. We found that disturbance
   of both vegetation and soil was more concentrated near marmot burrows in
   the unprotected area than in the protected area. In addition, the
   degrees of spatial heterogeneity of vegetation and soil NO3-N were
   greater in the unprotected area than in the protected area, where
   disturbance was more widely distributed. These results indicate that the
   spatial pattern of disturbance by herbivores affects the spatial
   heterogeneity of vegetation and soil properties through changes in the
   disturbance regime. Our findings also suggest that the intensity of
   disturbance is more important than its size in determining community
   structure in Mongolian grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important conservation issues in ecology is the
   imperiled state of grassland ecosystems worldwide due to land
   conversion, desertification, and the loss of native populations and
   species. The Janos region of northwestern Mexico maintains one of the
   largest remaining black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys ludovicianus) colony
   complexes in North America and supports a high diversity of threatened
   and endangered species. Yet, cattle grazing, agriculture, and drought
   have greatly impacted the region. We evaluated the impact of human
   activities on the Janos grasslands, comparing changes in the vertebrate
   community over the last two decades. Our results reveal profound, rapid
   changes in the Janos grassland community, demonstrating large declines
   in vertebrate abundance across all taxonomic groups. We also found that
   the 55,000 ha prairie dog colony complex has declined by 73\% since
   1988. The prairie dog complex has become increasingly fragmented, and
   their densities have shown a precipitous decline over the years, from an
   average density of 25 per ha in 1988 to 2 per ha in 2004. We
   demonstrated that prairie dogs strongly suppressed woody plant
   encroachment as well as created open grassland habitat by clearing woody
   vegetation, and found rapid invasion of shrubland once the prairie dogs
   disappeared from the grasslands. Comparison of grasslands and shrublands
   showed markedly different species compositions, with species richness
   being greatest when both habitats were considered together. Our data
   demonstrate the rapid decline of a grassland ecosystem, and documents
   the dramatic loss in biodiversity over a very short time period
   concomitant with anthropogenic grassland degradation and the decline of
   a keystone species.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the early vegetation dynamics in former croplands (sunflower
   and cereal fields) sown with a low-diversity seed mixture (composed of 2
   native grass species) in Egyek-Pusztakocs, Hortobagy National Park,
   East-Hungary. The percentage cover of vascular plants was recorded in 4
   permanent plots per field on 7 restored fields between 2006 and 2009.
   Ten aboveground biomass samples per field were also collected in June in
   each year. We addressed two questions: (i) How do seed sowing and annual
   mowing affect the species richness, biomass and cover of weeds? (ii) How
   fast does the cover of sown grasses develop after seed sowing? Weedy
   species were characteristic in the first year after sowing. In the
   second and third year their cover and species richness decreased. From
   the second year onwards the cover of perennial grasses increased.
   Spontaneously immigrating species characteristic to the reference
   grass-lands were also detected with low cover scores. Short-lived weeds
   were suppressed as their cover and biomass significantly decreased
   during the study. The amount of litter and sown grass biomass increased
   progressively. However, perennial weed cover, especially the cover of
   Cirsium arvense increased substantially. Our results suggest that
   grassland vegetation can be recovered by sowing low diversity mixtures

   more frequent mowing (multiple times a year) or grazing.}},

Abstract = {{A thorough understanding of the behavior of fire in grasslands is
   critical to the minimization of the impact of fires on agricultural and
   pastoral land as well as the successful management of the health,
   robustness, and species diversity of native grasslands. This is also
   necessary to understand the impact that a changing climate will have on
   these fires and the subsequent impacts and adaptation steps needed to
   protect valuable farmland and grassland ecosystems in the future, a
   challenge that will soon be facing all land managers. While a number of
   studies have investigated the impact of climate change on fire danger
   indices, the fire danger systems used in Australia are actually fire
   weather indices that provide no information about the likely impact of
   climate change on fire behavior.
   This chapter summarizes the state of the knowledge of fire behavior in
   grass fuels and discusses in detail the factors that influence the
   behavior of grassfires. The CSIRO Grassland Fire Spread Meter is the
   recommended operational system for the prediction of grassfire behavior
   in all Australian grass types. The system is used to assess the impact
   of a high-emission climate change scenario upon the likely behavior of
   grassfires throughout the fire season for three major pastoral and
   agricultural regions of eastern Australia in 2020 and 2050. It was found
   that mean fire rate of forward spread in ungrazed/natural pastures will
   increase by a maximum of 10\% by 2020 and by 32\% by 2050 in
   southeastern Australia. The implications for grassland management
   strategies and possible climate adaptation pathways are explored.}},

Abstract = {{The relative benefit of different grazing management practices for
   maintaining grassland biodiversity integrity was assessed. Practices
   considered were grazing system, stocking rate, animal type, grazing
   season, fire-grazing interaction, plus burning regime. Sparse empirical
   data indicated that stocking rate, cattle-to-sheep ratio, and increased
   fire intervals can affect plant diversity. Certain species behave as
   increaser or decreaser species in response to stocking rate or
   cattle-to-sheep ratio. Plant diversity appears robust in the face of
   variation in fire regime except for preclusion of fire. Multicriteria
   analysis was used to assess the relative impact of grazing systems
   (continuous, conventional, or high-intensity grazing by sheep, cattle,
   or sheep plus cattle) on grassland biodiversity integrity. Selected
   indicators covered landscape composition, structure and functioning.
   High-intensity systems and continuous sheep grazing have the most, and
   continuous grazing with beef the least, negative impact, depending on
   stocking rate. The relation between veld condition and plant diversity
   needs to be tested further before veld condition is used as a management
   tool for maintaining biodiversity. Proposed research priorities include

Abstract = {{Our aim in this study was to evaluate short-term (2 years) responses of

   diversity) to the mechanical disturbance associated with interseeding.
   Small mammal live trapping and vegetation sampling were conducted in
   2004 and 2005 on replicated 1ha study plots in a native Wyoming big
   sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt ssp. wyomingensis Beetle
   Young)-grassland that were: 1) mechanically disturbed in April 2003 and
   rested from grazing during the study (mechanical); 2) rested from
   grazing (rested); and 3) moderately grazed by cattle (grazed). Deer mice
   (Peromyscus maniculatus), northern grasshopper mouse (Onychomys
   leucogaster), and sagebrush vole (Lemmiscus curtatus) were the primary
   small mammal species captured during 7776 trap nights in 2004 and 2005.
   Small mammal diversity was greater for the mechanical (H'=1.22) than the

Pages = {{685-692}},
Abstract = {{Spiny shrubs protect non-defended plants against herbivores. Therefore,
   they play a role for the diversity in grazed ecosystems. While the
   importance of these keystone nurse shrubs is presently recognized,
   little is known about the factors controlling them. This knowledge is
   required to understand the functioning of grazed ecosystems and for
   sustainable management.
   We studied effects of cattle and rabbits on clonal expansion of Prunus
   spinosa in two ancient wood-pastures in the Netherlands. At each site we
   set up five blocks in grassland perpendicular to the edges of mature
   Prunus thickets, each block containing three herbivore treatments: (1)
   open-to-cattle-and-rabbits, (2) open to rabbits, cattle excluded, (3)
   cattle and rabbits excluded. We monitored the number and volume of
   Prunus ramets from 1998 to 2000 and again in 2003,3 years after
   exclosure-removal to restore grazing.
   For 1998-2000 ramet volume, but not ramet number, differed between
   treatments. Ramet volume was highest when both cattle and rabbits were
   excluded. Ramet volume did not differ between grazing by rabbits or
   cattle and rabbits combined, indicating that rabbits alone may be as
   effective in inhibiting clonal expansion as cattle and rabbits combined.
   Three years after exclosure-removal ramet number and volume had
   increased in all treatments. Number of ramets remained unaffected by
   (former) treatments. Ramet volume remained highest in the former
   cattle-plus-rabbits exclusion treatment, differing significantly from
   the `open-to-cattle-and-rabbits' treatment. So, once successfully
   established during herbivore absence, further expansion is not prevented
   by cattle and rabbit grazing.
   This study shows that vertebrate herbivory controls the keystone
   nurse-shrub in wood-pastures: combined cattle and rabbit grazing, and
   notably rabbits alone, inhibit expansion. Temporary herbivore absence
   allows expansion of ramets, which persists after herbivore-reappearance.
   Sustainable management of wood-pastures should allow spatial-temporal
   fluctuations of herbivore densities, leading to increased vegetation
   structure and associated biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Calcareous grasslands in Europe have shown wide scale declines in their
   extent and quality as a result of modern agricultural practices,
   increased atmospheric eutrophication and lack of management. In addition
   to being a key habitat for specialist plants, calcareous grasslands are
   also important for many threatened invertebrates. In this UK based
   study, we investigated the impact of military vehicle activity, floral
   species richness and vegetation structure on assemblages of detritivore,
   herbivore and predatory invertebrates. We also consider the impact that
   disturbance by military vehicle activity on the proportion of
   invertebrate species capable of flight, a surrogate for dispersal
   ability. Sward height was negatively correlated with detritivore,
   herbivore and predator species richness. Herbivores species richness was
   positively correlated with both forb and grass species richness. Spatial
   variation in the number of plant species was negatively correlated with
   herbivore species richness. Those sites most heavily disturbed by
   military vehicle activity supported the lowest proportions of flightless
   invertebrates. Successful management for calcareous grassland
   invertebrates should aim to maintain short swards with high floristic
   diversity, in terms of both the forbs and grasses. It should be noted,
   however, that these findings refer to principally surface rather than
   sward active invertebrates. While disturbance associated with military
   vehicle activity was not found to affect invertebrate species richness,
   it has negative consequences for the structure of invertebrate
   assemblages by selecting against invertebrates with low dispersal
   ability. To support invertebrate diversity in calcareous grasslands we
   emphasise the need for variety in the timing and type of management

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanistic links between environmental drivers, human
   disturbance, plant functional traits, and ecosystem properties is a
   fundamental aspect of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research.
   Recent studies have focused mostly on leaf-level traits or
   community-level weighted traits to predict species responses to grazing
   and the consequent change in ecosystem functioning. However, studies of
   leaf-level traits or community-level weighted traits seldom identify the
   mechanisms linking grazing impact on leaf traits to ecosystem
   functioning. Here, using a multi-organization-level approach, we
   examined the effects of grazing on leaf traits (i.e., leaf area, leaf
   dry mass and specific leaf area) and ecosystem functioning across six
   communities of three vegetation types along a soil moisture gradient in
   the Xilin River Basin of Inner Mongolia grassland, China. Our results
   showed that the effects of grazing on leaf traits differed substantially
   when scaling up from leaf-level to species, functional group (i.e., life
   forms and water ecotype types), and community levels; and they also
   varied with vegetation type or site conditions. The effects of grazing
   on leaf traits diminished progressively along the hierarchy of
   organizational levels in the meadow, whereas the impacts were
   predominantly negative and the magnitude of the effects increased
   considerably at higher organizational levels in the typical steppe. Soil
   water and nutrient availability, functional trade-offs between leaf size
   and number of leaves per individual, and differentiation in avoidance
   and tolerance strategies among coexisting species are likely to be
   responsible for the observed responses of leaf traits to grazing at
   different levels of organization and among vegetation types. Our
   findings also demonstrate that, at both the functional group and
   community levels, standing aboveground biomass increased with leaf area
   and specific leaf area. Compared with the large changes in leaf traits
   and standing aboveground biomass, the soil properties were relatively
   unaffected by grazing. Our study indicates that a
   multi-organization-level approach provides more robust and comprehensive
   predictions of the effects of grazing on leaf traits and ecosystem
   functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Comprehensive and standardized biodiversity monitoring schemes are
   needed to build scientifically sound decision-making tools for
   biodiversity conservation. Based on a thorough review of published
   literature, we propose a novel biodiversity monitoring framework to
   unify conservation theory and practice. The framework is built on the
   inter-connection among different types of indicators, and on the
   systematic articulation of their relationships into seven indicator
   approaches. Semi-natural grasslands and shrublands in Europe, which
   still lack a common biodiversity monitoring scheme, are used as a model
   for the framework. Different biotic indicators have been widely used to
   estimate the state of biodiversity, but we integrate these with
   biodiversity drivers, i.e. factors driving changes in biodiversity, to
   track biodiversity response to environmental changes. Precise
   information on biodiversity drivers (e.g. past and present management or
   disturbance regimes, environmental conditions, landscape patterns) has
   an effective indicator value, but this is often not taken into account
   in monitoring schemes. Our framework can be used to detect gaps in
   available data, translate indicator systems into practical conservation,
   identify combined sets of indicators to monitor biodiversity in target
   habitats, and recognize most suitable surrogates when information for
   some indicators is missing. We also take into account the effect of
   regional species pools in order to consider large-scale historical and
   biogeographical processes. We propose general guidelines to create
   validate and launch biodiversity monitoring frameworks for target
   habitats in the light of current examples of biodiversity conservation
   schemes (e.g. Natura 2000 in Europe). (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Capsule Green Woodpeckers exhibited strong feeding-site preference,

   Aims To identify the habitat characteristics influencing feeding-site
   selection across farmland.
   Methods A pair of Green Woodpeckers was radiotracked during a breeding
   season. Habitat and prey abundance variables were compared within the
   birds' combined home-ranges. CANOCO was used to identify ecological
   gradients, and logistic regression used to predict feeding-site use
   based on ant abundance with resultant residuals correlated to identify
   habitat features that further influenced site selection.
   Results Most feeding was done in sheep-grazed pastures and garden lawns
   with arable and cattle-grazed land avoided. Green Woodpecker feeding
   sites were associated with areas of short grassland with high plant
   richness and high densities of ants, especially Lasius flavus. Logistic
   regression correctly classified 98\% of cases from ant abundance. The
   woodpecker pair had a greater probability of feeding in areas with deep
   leaf litter, high plant species richness, and lower probability if the
   site had tall or dense vegetation, or heavily compacted soils.
   Conclusions Structural habitat characteristics were important, with this
   woodpecker pair foraging in short grazed and mown grasslands. If these
   results are replicated elsewhere then appropriate farm management may
   benefit Green Woodpeckers significantly.}},

Abstract = {{Many recent studies have focused on the relationship between
   biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, such as investigations into the
   productivity of experimental plant communities. One of the central
   issues affecting the functioning of ecosystems is the diversity of
   resident species richness and the composition of the plant community.
   However, one challenge to experimental studies is that results from
   artificial ecosystems may have little value for predicting loss of
   diversity and function degradation in natural ecosystems. Thus, recent
   studies have focused more on investigations of natural ecosystems; these
   studies have found that species diversity and ecosystem productivity
   usually correlate with various abiotic factors including environmental
   effects, such as soil nutrition and precipitation, as well as anthropic
   activities, such as grazing and agricultural yield. In this study, we
   aimed to test the validity of biotic factors reported in experimental
   studies to be major factors affecting the productivity of ecosystems,
   and then to determine whether the relationship between biodiversity and
   ecosystem function is confounded by environmental factors. We
   investigated the effects of plant biodiversity and community composition
   on ecosystem function (productivity) in semiarid grassland in Inner
   Mongolia, China that contained three vegetation types: arid steppe,
   steppe, and meadow steppe. Our results show that both diversity and
   community composition significantly affect productivity and are better
   predictors of productivity than environmental factors, such as soil
   conditions. Our findings are consistent with the assumptions of niche
   complementarity. This study suggests that both biodiversity and
   community composition are important biotic factors in the functioning of
   ecosystems located in semiarid grasslands. In addition, environmental
   parameters, such as soil conditions influence productivity indirectly by
   affecting both biotic factors at the same time.}},

Title = {{How much does grazing-induced heterogeneity impact plant diversity in
   wet grasslands?}},
Journal = {{ECOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{229-239}},
Abstract = {{The positive impact of grazing herbivores on plant diversity has been
   frequently reported in fertile grasslands. Grazing-induced heterogeneity
   is often evoked as an explanation for this influence. However, the
   relative importance of plant community heterogeneity induced by
   herbivores compared to other mechanisms linked to grazing remains
   unclear. We investigated this question by looking at 3 plant communities
   found in wet grasslands situated along the French Atlantic coast and
   traditionally grazed by horses and cattle. An experimental design set up
   in 1995 allowed us to compare the consequences of cattle-grazing,
   horse-grazing, and grazing abandonment on plant community diversity and
   heterogeneity. Floristic measurements made in 2007 showed that cattle
   and horses both had a positive impact on species richness and Shannon
   diversity index and that patchiness only occurred in grazed situations.
   The relative importance of grazing-induced patchiness within the overall
   positive effect of grazing on plant diversity was assessed by
   partitioning the diversity gain due to grazing into its additive
   within-and among-patch components. Grazing-induced patchiness entirely
   explained the increase in plant richness, whereas it accounted for only
   a small part of Shannon diversity. Grazing-related processes operating
   at the patch scale explained the main part of the increase in Shannon
   diversity. These processes make only a limited contribution to species
   recruitment, but they result in a more even species abundance
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experiments suggest that introduced, non-migratory Canada geese
   (Branta canadensis) may be facilitating the spread of exotic grasses and
   decline of native plant species abundance on small islets in the Georgia
   Basin, British Columbia, which otherwise harbour outstanding examples of
   threatened maritime meadow ecosystems. We examined this idea by testing
   if the presence of geese predicted the abundance of exotic grasses and
   native competitors at 2 spatial scales on 39 islands distributed
   throughout the Southern Gulf and San Juan Islands of Canada and the
   United States, respectively. At the plot level, we found significant
   positive relationships between the percent cover of goose feces and
   exotic annual grasses. However, this trend was absent at the scale of
   whole islands. Because rapid population expansion of introduced geese in
   the region only began in the 1980s, our results are consistent with the
   hypothesis that the deleterious effects of geese on the cover of exotic
   annual grasses have yet to proceed beyond the local scale, and that a
   window of opportunity now exists in which to implement management
   strategies to curtail this emerging threat to native ecosystems.
   Research is now needed to test if the removal of geese results in the

Abstract = {{We examined the role of the soil seed bank along a grazing disturbance
   gradient and its relationship with the vegetation of alpine meadows on
   the Tibet plateau, and discussed the implications for restoration. The
   seed bank had a high potential for restoration of species-rich
   vegetation; 62 species were identified in the vegetation and 87 in the
   seed bank, 39 species being common to both. Mean seed density was
   3069-6105 viable seeds m(-2). The density of buried seeds increased
   significantly with increasing disturbance, indicating that restoration
   of disturbed areas is not seed limited. Seed density and species
   richness decreased with depth. The proportion of perennial species
   decreased with decrease in disturbance both in seed bank and in
   vegetation. A large portion of species with persistent seeds in the
   disturbed areas indicate that this seed type can be regarded a strategy
   of adaptation to current disturbances. Detrended correspondence analysis
   (DCA) showed significant differences of species composition between seed
   bank and vegetation, except for the seriously disturbed site. Our
   results suggest that the establishment of new species in severely
   disturbed areas is more dependent on the seed bank. By contrast, the
   restoration in less-disturbed and mature meadows does not rely on seed
   banks, and the establishment of the vegetation in these communities is
   more likely to rely on seed dispersal from the standing vegetation and
   on species with vegetative reproduction. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Shrub removal is commonly used for management and restoration of

   of willow is a vigorous re-sprouting and quick re-growth. In this paper
   we test experimentally what is an effective management option, limiting
   the re-growth of willow after cutting, on peat soils. In this experiment
   (split-plotset-up) we tested mowing of different intensity, removal of
   young shoots by hand and herbicide application, to find out which of
   them effectively limits willow re-growth. All applied treatments limited
   re-sprouting, but to different extents. We found that mowing had a
   strong, negative effect on increase in height of the shoots and on
   increase of the number of leaves, while an application of Roundup
   strongly limited the number of new shoots, in comparison with control.
   When all measured characteristics were accounted for, the combination of
   Roundup use and annual mowing was most effective. If the use of
   herbicide is to be avoided, intensive mowing in the first years(x 2 or x
   3) should be applied, followed by annual mowing. We concluded that
   removal of young shoots by hand did not have a stronger effect in
   weakening the willow re-growth than mowing. The treatment with herbicide

   habitats along transects were categorised in the field. The butterfly
   composition varied depending on the landscape composition. Tree cover

Title = {{Land use in subalpine grasslands affects nitrogen cycling via changes in
   plant community and soil microbial uptake dynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{62-73}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Nitrogen (N) cycling is a key process determining ecosystem
   functioning in subalpine grasslands where traditional mowing and
   manuring are being abandoned. However, the roles of the plant and
   microbial communities in mediating changes in N availability are still
   poorly understood.
   2. We inoculated 15 subalpine grassland fields with dual-labelled
   ammonium nitrate (15NH(4)+, 15NO(3)-) during July 2005 and used pool
   dilutions over 1 month to calculate inorganic N fluxes into the
   microbial pool and uptake in plant communities by grasses, forbs and
   legumes. The effects of current land abandonment were assessed by
   comparing manured and mown terraces (ancient croplands) with other
   terraces where these practices have ceased, and mown versus unmown
   unterraced meadows.
   3. Rapid cycling of inorganic N and high soil N availability in
   forb-dominated manured and mown terraces resulted from fast plant N
   uptake and low microbial C:N ratio. In grass-dominated unmown terraces,
   N cycling was slower and N retention was greater; microbial N uptake
   remained similar to that in the other terraces, although a higher C:N
   ratio suggested a shift towards fungal dominance.
   4. In unterraced meadows, pH was low due to reduced mixing of soil with
   the underlying calcareous rock. Soil {[}NH(4)+] was high and {[}NO(3)-]
   low, but current management had no effect on N pool size, although plant
   N uptake was greater in the mown than unmown fields. This may be
   partially explained by high N retention by dominant Festuca paniculata
   tussocks. The microbial N pool and N uptake were both low and the
   microbial C:N ratio was high, suggesting that fungi slowed N cycling and
   reduced the influence of mowing on N turnover.
   5. Synthesis. In these marginal long-term grasslands, with low
   productivity and high biodiversity value, changes in ecosystem function
   associated with reduced management intensity were mediated through
   slower N cycling. This response was expressed as more gradual nutrient
   uptake but greater retention by unmown plant communities, slower
   microbial uptake and smaller soil N pools. In contrast to more
   productive ecosystems, such as north-western European grasslands,
   reduced management is detrimental to both biodiversity and the
   maintenance of soil-related ecosystem services. These costs will need to
   be balanced against potential benefits, such as carbon storage.}},

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{98}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{237-245}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Plant genotypic diversity has important consequences for a variety
   of ecosystem processes, yet empirical evidence for its effects on
   productivity, one of the most fundamental of these processes, is
   lacking. In addition, the performance of insect herbivores in response
   to high genotypic diversity is unknown, despite previous work
   demonstrating differential herbivore performance among plant genotypes.
   2. We manipulated genotypic diversity of the annual plant Arabidopsis
   thaliana in both the presence and absence of the generalist herbivore
   Trichoplusia ni under semi-natural growth conditions. We used nine
   genotypes (eight ecotypes and one mutant) of A. thaliana known to differ
   widely in functional traits. Productivity and insect biomass were
   measured in monocultures and mixtures of all nine genotypes grown at
   multiple fertilization levels and planting densities.
   3. In both the absence and presence of herbivores, genotypic diversity
   increased plant productivity and survival. This effect was, for the most
   part, independent of fertility or density. Sampling or selection effects
   did not appear to be wholly responsible for these results as all
   genotypes were maintained in equal proportion and no single genotype
   became dominant for the duration of the experiment.
   4. High diversity increased T. ni biomass and survival in all
   treatments. Insect biomass was positively, but not tightly, correlated
   to plant biomass, indicating that the higher herbivore performance
   observed in genotypic mixtures was only partially due to higher
   productivity.
   5.Synthesis. Our data support the idea that even within a single plant
   species, genotypic diversity can exert strong influences on both the
   producer and herbivore communities. The exact mechanisms responsible for
   these effects and the relative importance of genotypic diversity in
   natural communities warrant further investigation.}},

Title = {{Proximity to rocky reefs alters the balance between positive and
   negative effects on seagrass fauna}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{405}},
Pages = {{175-186}},
Abstract = {{Proximity to habitat margins can alter the balance between positive and
   negative forces on species abundance. Based on this idea we examined
   abundance patterns of herbivorous gastropods in seagrasses adjacent to
   rocky reefs. We tested whether the balance between the intensity of
   predation (negative effect) and recruitment of new individuals (positive
   effect) changes with increasing distance from reefs. Abundances of
   gastropods varied with distance to reefs, but the direction of changes
   in abundance was taxon-specific: some taxa decreased in abundance with
   increasing distance from reefs (e.g. Pyrene bidentata), while others
   showed the opposite pattern (e.g. Cantharidus lepidus). Predators were
   more abundant on reefs and in immediately adjacent seagrasses, relative
   to seagrass meadow interiors. Predation intensity on 2 species with
   opposite patterns of abundance with proximity to reefs (P. bidentata and
   C. lepidus) was consistently higher in seagrasses near reef edges than
   in seagrass interiors, and C. lepidus was more susceptible to predation
   than P. bidentata. Recruitment of P. bidentata was higher in seagrasses
   adjacent to reefs relative to seagrass interiors, whereas recruitment of
   C. lepidus did not vary with distance from reefs. Dispersal of P.
   bidentata individuals from reefs probably explains the greater
   recruitment of P. bidentata at seagrass edges relative to interiors;
   this compensates for losses due to predation, thereby enabling high
   abundance in seagrasses adjacent to reefs despite suffering greater
   predation at this distance relative to the interiors of the seagrass
   meadows. In contrast, losses of C. lepidus due to predation reduced its
   abundance in seagrasses adjacent to reefs, while recruitment was
   invariant, so this species was most abundant in seagrass meadow
   interiors. Thus, proximity to habitat margins affected abundance
   patterns by influencing mortality (predation) and replenishment
   (recruitment) of populations. This balance was dependent on species
   identity, and led to contrasting patterns of abundance among species
   with proximity to habitat interfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the distribution and relative abundance of leaf
   beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) within the United States. However,
   recent extensive collecting efforts within Kentucky, as well as the
   compilation and digitization of label data from seven museum
   collections, have resulted in distribution data for 11,079 beetles
   collected between 1884 and 2007. We used an integrated approach to
   assign abundance classifications of rare, local, infrequent, frequent,
   and abundant to the 253 known leaf beetle species recorded,
   incorporating both specimen data and Our knowledge of the dataset. We
   initially selected a recently collected subset of 149 species, which
   were assigned preliminary subjective classifications. Possible index
   calculations were applied to all 253 species, and the calculation whose
   order was most aligned with the subjective classifications was chosen.
   Cutoff,., between categories (e.g., abundant to frequent) were
   identified using subjective classifications as well its natural breaks
   in data or index values. Final classifications resulted in 132 rare, 38
   local, 44 infrequent, 20 frequent, and 19 abundant species. These
   categories were 81.9\% consistent with those given ail initial
   subjective classification. In order to assess the ability of our
   abundance classifications to differentiate habitat types and quality, we
   used contingency analysis to compare leaf beetle species composition
   from two habitats (a native grassland nature preserve and a research
   farm). Species composition between these two habitats was significantly
   different (Pearson's chi(2) = 11.4, P = 0.023). Our results indicate
   that quantitative data can be used to establish consistent abundance
   classifications, which can then be used to compare species composition
   of different habitats or communities.}},

Abstract = {{The African tulip tree, Spathodea campanulata Beauv., is an introduced
   species forming novel forest types in Puerto Rico. These forests develop
   naturally after deforestation, agricultural use and land abandonment,
   and there are many questions as to their ecological characteristics. We
   sampled structure and species composition of large, small, and juvenile
   trees (a parts per thousand yen10, a parts per thousand yen2.5 to < 10,
   and < 2.5 cm diameter at breast height, respectively) in nine secondary
   forests dominated by S. campanulata on alluvial, karst, and volcanic
   substrates in northcentral Puerto Rico. No differences were found in S.
   campanulata forest structure between substrates. Of a total of 79
   species found, 17 were introduced. Forests on karst and alluvium had the
   highest and lowest global species richness, respectively. Species
   richness increased from large to small to juvenile trees in most sites,
   but more so on karst. The percentage of introduced species was inversely
   related to species richness of tree size classes on all substrate types.
   The dominance of S. campanulata in the large tree size class was highest
   and lowest in alluvial and volcanic sites, respectively, and decreased
   from large to small to juvenile trees on all substrate types. Species
   richness of S. campanulata forests is lower than that of native forests
   on equivalent substrates. Although land use history affects composition,
   the juvenile tree species established in S. campanulata forests seems to
   correspond to the geological substrate were sites are found. This study
   shows S. campanulata restores forest structure and native tree species
   on abandoned agriculture and grazing lands in Puerto Rico. Management of
   these novel forests should consider them as resources were natural
   processes have the potential of making them more diverse.}},

Volume = {{34}},

Pages = {{219-226}},
Abstract = {{Leaf functional traits have been proposed as general indicators of plant
   palatability to ungulate herbivores, identifying which species are
   likely to be most at risk from ungulates, and how ungulate grazing may
   change ecosystem processes. However, few studies have tested whether
   leaf trait palatability relationships are consistent across different
   ungulate species. The palatability of 44 native New Zealand grass taxa
   (from the genera Festuca and Chionochloa) to two ungulate herbivores
   (sheep Ovis aries and red deer Cervus elaphus scoticus) was assessed in
   cafeteria experiments. There were significant differences between sheep
   and deer in the selection or avoidance of grass taxa, in part related to
   differences in response to variation in leaf functional traits. Deer had
   a greater tendency than sheep to select grasses with a higher specific
   leaf area (SLA) and to avoid taxa with a low SLA, suggesting that it is
   not possible to generalise leaf trait palatability relationships across
   different ungulate species. Results suggest different ungulate species
   are likely to have additive effects on the biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning of New Zealand's native grasslands. These findings indicate
   that the impacts of ungulate herbivory on ecosystem processes will

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{355-364}},
Abstract = {{We studied the effects of sheep grazing intensity and abandonment on
   plant species richness and composition, plant life forms and the
   productivity of North Adriatic Karst pastures. The experimental sites
   were under controlled grazing regimes (heavy, moderate, light and
   abandonment) for 10 years. Data were collected during one season; plant
   species composition, the number of species and above-ground and
   below-ground biomass were evaluated. Species richness was significantly
   reduced with increasing grazing intensity and abandonment. The greatest
   differences in species composition were recorded for the heavily grazed
   site owing to the appearance of a group of grasslands species typical of
   nutrient-rich soil. Heavy grazing increased therophytes and decreased
   the proportion of chamaephytes and geophytes. Above-ground productivity
   at the season's peak was typical of subhumid grasslands (up to 500 g
   m-2) and was significantly the highest in the abandoned pasture.
   Below-ground biomass was significantly the lowest in the heavily grazed
   sites and the highest in those that were moderately or lightly grazed.
   We could conclude that grazing intensification and abandonment have
   significant effects on the structure of these pastures. Low- or
   moderate-intensity (4-7 sheep ha-1) grazing seems to be the most
   appropriate treatment since it can maintain the species richness and

Year = {{2010}},
Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{77-85}},
Abstract = {{Background: It was hypothesised that bryophyte and vascular plant
   richness of vegetation should exhibit different patterns along gradients
   of elevation, vegetation productivity and sheep grazing pressure.
   Aims: The species richness of bryophytes and vascular plant was studied
   in relation to biomass, elevation and sheep preference on the oceanic
   northern Atlantic island of St Kilda, Scotland.
   Methods: Plant communities and biomass were sampled from productive
   lowlands to summit grasslands associated with decreasing sheep
   preference. The relationships between bryophyte and vascular plant
   diversity, elevation and sheep were examined using generalised linear
   models and smooth trend-surface analyses.
   Results: Bryophyte and vascular plant richness showed contrasting trends
   in relation to elevation, sheep preference and biomass. Bryophyte
   richness peaked at mid to high elevations, was negatively related to
   levels of sheep preference and standing litter, and showed a curvilinear
   relation to biomass. Vascular plant species richness had a negative
   relationship with elevation, negative or unimodal association with sheep
   preference, and negative relationship with biomass.
   Conclusions: Bryophyte and vascular plant richness patterns in relation
   to elevation, vegetation productivity and sheep grazing are not adequate
   surrogates for each other, and suggest that general species richness
   models could benefit from organism-specific adjustments.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term overgrazing has resulted in grassland deterioration and even

   we examined the characteristics of vegetation and soil properties in the
   fivestock-excluded pastures and the adjacent grazed pastures under two
   topographic habitats (the flat valley and the south-facing slope).
   Seven-year exclusion of livestock has enhanced aboveground live biomass,
   root biomass and litter accumulation. Livestock exclusion has also
   increased soil bulk density and soil water content, soil organic C
   concentration, total N concentration and its transformation rate, and
   soil microbial activity. The results showed that livestock exclusion has
   facilitated vegetation recovery and improved physical, chemical and
   biological properties of soil. However, livestock exclusion has
   significantly decreased graminoid biomass accumulation, especially on
   the flat valley, the biodiversity also significantly decreased there.
   The results suggested that long-term livestock exclusion was
   disadvantageous for palatable forage production and biodiversity
   protection on the flat valley. Compared to the flat valley, the
   grassland on the south-facing slope was under more severe degradation,
   and the reversion was in a slower process. Thus, the optimal grassland
   management in the livestock-excluded pasture on the flat valley should
   include a low or moderate grazing intensity or adopt an alternate
   grazing system, but more effective and even longer livestock exclusion
   practice should be taken on the south-facing slope.}},

   showed an increase in plant community forms that were abandoned or
   invaded by alien species. An association that was most like the typical
   form was seen in well maintained meadows, which suggests that the
   Disturbance Index continually rises with time after a meadow is
   abandoned. Ecological strategies and mowing tolerance were determined

Abstract = {{Rangelands and savannas occupy 70\% of the Australian continent and are
   mainly used for commercial grazing of sheep and cattle. In the center
   and north, where there are extensive areas of indigenous land ownership
   and pastoral production is less intensive, savanna burning is frequent.
   Greenhouse gas emissions from rangelands have been overwhelmingly from
   land clearing and methane production by livestock. Reductions in the
   rate of land clearing have substantially reduced Australia's greenhouse
   gas emissions, but these have been controversial with the reduced
   potential pasture production being of concern to many land managers.
   Reductions in direct livestock emissions are possible through
   manipulation of the genetics, rumen flora, or diet of animals. However,
   the greatest potential benefit is a whole-property approach with
   improved animal husbandry and attention to other aspects of property
   management such as fossil fuel consumption. Focus on emissions per unit
   of land area is likely to have other ecological benefits for land
   condition and to capture the effects of changes in carbon stocks in
   vegetation and soils. In much of northern and central Australia, changes
   in settlement patterns have led to more frequent and intense fires than
   under indigenous management regimes before European settlement. The
   implementation of more benign regimes of savanna burning has great
   potential benefit for greenhouse abatement, biodiversity, and
   livelihoods of indigenous people in remote settlements.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, temperate grasslands have been extensively cleared for
   agriculture and urban expansion and the `Natural Temperate Grassland of
   the Victorian Volcanic Plain' in south-eastern Australia has recently
   been listed as critically endangered. Because of land clearing, these
   grasslands now occupy <1\% of their original distribution and much of
   the remaining grassland continues to be grazed by livestock. Although
   forbs (wildflowers) constitute most of the floristic richness in natural
   grasslands, few experimental studies have focused on their responses to
   strategic livestock grazing and rest. This paper reports on the outcomes
   of five grazing and rest management regimes imposed for 4 years at three
   sites on the Victorian Volcanic Plain. Seasonal grazing and rest
   management regimes resulted in significantly different native and exotic
   forb frequencies, but not richness. Native perennial and exotic annual
   forb frequency was higher when management incorporated grazing and rest
   periods (14 and 16\% deviance explained), particularly with spring rest
   from grazing. However, the most important influence on native perennial
   and exotic annual and perennial forb frequency (46, 58 and 41\% deviance
   explained) and native perennial and exotic annual species richness (62
   and 35\% deviance explained) was site. Differences among the three sites
   included soil, rainfall, size of remnant, presence of small burrowing
   mammals, management history and consequent species assemblages. Despite
   differences among sites, the results indicate that native perennial forb
   frequency may be increased using management regimes that incorporate
   both grazing and rest. However, targeted management may be necessary to
   reduce exotic annual forbs, also promoted by grazing with seasonal rest.}},

Abstract = {{The native grassland of the Victorian Volcanic Plain, in south-western
   Victoria, Australia, is a critically endangered community. Much of the
   remaining grassland exists on private land, where it is grazed by
   livestock. The impacts of two grazing management strategies, implemented
   under the PlainsTender incentive scheme, were monitored at 18 on-farm
   native grassland sites for 4 years. The management strategies were (1)
   excluding grazing during spring, or (2) flexible grazing and resting.
   Maintenance of >70\% vegetation cover was required under both
   strategies. Generalised least-squares (repeated-measures) modelling
   revealed a significant correlation between plant functional group cover
   and management. However, this correlation was present at the outset of
   the study and was maintained for the duration of monitoring. Sites
   rested from livestock grazing in spring had higher native and exotic
   grass cover, while exotic forb cover was higher at sites where grazing
   was managed flexibly. Native and exotic grass cover varied significantly
   from year-to-year under both management strategies; we attribute this to
   variation in rainfall, particularly drought in the second year. A key
   outcome of this study was the recognition that high conservation value
   native grasslands, i.e. large (>= 100 ha) and intact (>= 36 native
   species), are being managed successfully on private land, using a range
   of conservative livestock grazing strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The published records of grazing trials that measured pasture and animal
   production, carried out by CSIRO in northern Australia from the 1950s to
   2000, have been collated. They have been grouped into 5 geographical
   regions: coastal subtropical Queensland, subcoastal subtropical
   Queensland, tropical Queensland, the Northern Territory and northern
   Western Australia. The duration of each trial is given plus an
   indication of whether it included native pastures, oversown native
   pastures and/or fully improved pastures. The treatments imposed, e. g.
   stocking rates, tree killing, introduction of legumes, use of
   supplements, fertilisation (N, P, K or lime) and burning, have been
   tabulated for each trial. This format makes it easy to find all trials
   that examined the effects of any particular variable.
   Many trials measured attributes other than cattle liveweight gain and
   pasture yield and composition, including: demography, biodiversity, seed
   contents of faeces, pasture quality, carcase quality and economics,
   dietary composition, run-off following rainfall and soil fertility.
   Extra attributes measured in each trial are listed, making it possible
   to determine which trials have information on any specified attribute.
   No experimental data are presented; rather this is a record of where
   experimental data can be found. Similar pasture information is given for
   a further 12 trials where grazing treatments were imposed but no
   measurements made of animal production.
   Some comments are made about regional differences in the emphasis placed
   on native pastures as compared with fully improved pastures. It is
   suggested that inadequate emphasis was given to burning and to grazing
   management, other than stocking rates, as variables. In addition, there
   has been inadequate use of grazing trials as a resource in which to
   measure how attributes such as biodiversity and soil properties have
   been affected by the treatments imposed. It is also pointed out that
   writing up the results of grazing trials for the conventional scientific
   paper has resulted in the loss of data that could be useful in model
   development and validation. Some comments are made about attributes
   which could have been measured, at least in some trials, but were not.
   Finally, it is stressed that the value of many grazing studies, in terms
   of measuring changes in botanical composition, has been limited by their
   short duration.}},

Abstract = {{In intensive arable areas, field margins can constitute boundary
   biotopes that are valuable for natural resource conservation. In order
   to analyse the potential for implementing more field margin measures,
   865 responding farmers in intensive arable areas in three German federal
   states were surveyed. Determinants of their willingness to participate
   in field margin measures were analysed by binary logistic regression.
   The farmers were asked about the optimal design of field margins, and
   these designs are discussed within the context of nature conservation
   goals. The results show that farmers implement field margins less often
   if they are risk-averse. Farmers already implementing grassland
   environmental measures and mulch seeding or extensification measures
   with regards to herbicide and fertiliser reductions on arable land more
   often adopt field margin measures. Regarding the design of field
   margins, farmers' preferences hardly differ between the federal states,
   and they do not significantly conflict with nature conservation needs in
   intensive arable areas. The main fear is the risk of weed spreading.
   Therefore, farmers prefer sown field margins, mown at least once a year
   and treated with restricted herbicide applications. Certain features,
   such as seed mixture, mowing date and plant protection measures, could
   be adapted in order to minimise conflicts with nature conservation
   objectives. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Extensification of grassland management has been put forward as a method
   of redressing the biodiversity losses seen in agricultural landscapes as
   a result of increases in production. However, there is little evidence
   for its success, particularly in upland areas. Two long-term (16 year)
   experiments at different sites compared extensive grazing, abandonment
   and continued intensive grazing, assessing impacts on productivity,
   species composition and plant diversity. Extensive grazing led to slow
   but continual changes in composition, with some increase in diversity
   compared to intensive grazing and a broad indication that productivity
   did not decline with time. At the drier of the two sites it appeared
   that extensive grazing was better than intensive grazing at buffering
   the impacts on productivity of year-to-year variations in the weather.
   Abandonment led to rapid changes in composition followed by
   stabilisation, as there were no late-successional species to invade and
   lead to further changes. However, abandonment did not affect diversity.
   Extensive grazing produced only gradual changes in the diversity of
   plant species present, indicating that biodiversity gains from
   extensification within productive landscapes may be a slow process. (C)

   influenced by epiphyte load. Individual amphipod species showed
   significant density fluctuations over the year. The canonical

Abstract = {{Many studies have found positive relationships between plant diversity
   and arthropod communities, but the interactive effects of plant genetic
   diversity and environmental stress on arthropods are not well
   documented. In this study, we investigated the consequences of plant
   genotypic diversity, watering treatment, and its interaction for the
   ground-dwelling arthropod community in an experimental common garden of
   quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.). We found that varying plant
   genotypic diversity and watering treatment altered multivariate
   arthropod community composition and structure. Arthropod biodiversity
   and richness showed a distinct response to the plant diversity x
   watering treatment interaction, declining sharply in water-limited
   genotypic mixtures. Abundance of arthropod functional groups did not
   show any response to diversity or the plant diversity x watering
   treatment interaction, but varied in their response to watering
   treatment, with predator and detritivore abundance increasing and
   parasitoid abundance decreasing in well-watered blocks. Our results
   conflict with most previous studies, and suggest that environmental
   stress can substantially change the nature of the plant-arthropod
   diversity relationship. Additionally, we suggest that the
   plant-arthropod diversity relationship is dependent on the type of plant

   diversity and ground-dwelling arthropods may be much different than more
   commonly studied grassland species and herbivorous arthropods.}},

Abstract = {{European wet grasslands are characterized by high diversity of plant and
   animal species but are threatened by intensive land use. Although
   preservation or restoration of species-rich wet grasslands requires low
   nutrient availability that could be achieved by long-term management,
   studies monitoring nutrient removal are lacking. Our objective was to
   assess the long-term effect of management (mowing twice a year without
   or with PK fertilization for 20 years) on (i) productivity and nutrient
   removal with the harvest, (ii) the type of nutrient limitation, and
   (iii) plant species richness in wet grasslands in north-western Germany
   considering the differences between organic and mineral soils.
   Initially low nutrient availability in soil led to decreased
   productivity and base cation removal with harvest particularly on
   mineral soils after six years of mowing twice a year without
   fertilization. On mineral soils, N:K ratios indicated limitation of
   plant growth by K. On organic soils, neither productivity nor K removal
   with the harvest changed with time suggesting additional K input
   probably caused by rising groundwater. On organic soils, K:P ratios and
   a significant decrease of productivity with increasing N:P ratios
   suggested P limitation. Plant species richness was maintained or even
   slightly increased by mowing twice a year without fertilization but
   mainly comprised species that were already present at the study sites.
   Productivity and N, P, K, and Mg removal with the harvest was
   significantly increased by mowing twice a year with PK fertilization
   while species richness was maintained. After 10 years, N:K ratios
   indicate K limitation even for mowing twice a year with PK
   fertilization. In case of initially low nutrient availability in soil,
   cautious PK fertilization and mowing can be recommended to meet demands
   of agriculture and nature conservation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Since 1992 the European Union helps member states to reverse the loss of
   biodiversity in agricultural landscapes by the financial support of
   agri-environment schemes. Long-term studies investigating the effects of
   these schemes are an essential prerequisite for the development of an
   effective policy to restore biodiversity on farmland. In Dutch meadow
   landscapes almost all agri-environment schemes focus on the restoration
   of meadow bird populations by postponement of the mowing date. Between
   1990 and 2002 we measured long-term changes in meadow bird densities in
   areas with and without agri-environment schemes in the Netherlands, both
   before and after the start of the contract. During these years bird
   territories were surveyed during five field visits between 15 March and
   15 June. Densities of black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), and redshank
   (Tringa totanus) were higher in the areas with management agreements,
   but these differences were already present before the start of the
   contracts. After the start of the management contracts densities of
   black-tailed godwit and oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) did not
   increase, while those of lapwing (Vanellus vanellus) and redshank even
   declined relative to the control areas. It is concluded that the current
   agri-environment schemes are not sufficient to restore meadow bird
   populations in Dutch agricultural landscapes. In addition to the
   prescribed postponement of the mowing date, it is probably necessary to
   raise groundwater levels and to reduce fertilization to allow for the
   development of an open vegetation structure that will increase chick
   survival to sufficiently high levels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The vegetation composition of calcareous grasslands in Central Europe is
   mainly determined by the applied management treatments and the nutrient
   status of the ecosystems, but these factors cannot clearly be separated.
   Recently several authors reported a shift in growth-limiting plant
   nutrients from nitrogen to phosphate. Therefore, we tested the
   interaction between management and plant available phosphate in a
   long-term experiment in Southern Germany with different management
   treatments applied to calcareous grassland. We measured mycorrhization
   rates, which are assumed to be high at low phosphate availability, to
   explore the interaction between management, phosphate availability and
   vegetation composition. By correlating mycorrhization rates to
   vegetation and soil data we found that treatments involving nutrient
   removal show a greater degree of mycorrhization than treatments leading
   to nutrient enrichment. According to decreasing suitability for
   grassland conservation, the six different management treatments could be
   ranked as mowing, followed by mulching (twice a year, once a year and
   every second year), burning and undisturbed succession. It was shown,
   that mycorrhizal infection rates (1) can be used to evaluate different
   management treatments for their suitability to conserve the initial
   vegetation composition, and (2) may provide information about the
   processes of adaptation to the current management, namely to differences
   in plant available phosphate. However, as discussed for the undisturbed
   succession treatment, it might not be sufficient to look at the degree
   of mycorrhization only. These are related to phosphate availability, but
   to detect adaptation processes to management, the degree of
   mycorrhization should be analysed together with plant's internal
   nutrient relocation patterns.}},

   Local abundance of spiders in general was not associated with time since

Abstract = {{The role of plant community structure and plant functional traits for

   Monoliths were extracted from two contrasted long-term field treatments
   (high vs. low grazing disturbance) and exposed to both low and high
   (simulated grazing) disturbance during a 2 years experiment. Carbon
   dioxide exchanges were measured continuously in an open flow system. Net
   ecosystem productivity and ecosystem C balance were positively
   correlated at low disturbance with plant species richness. Aboveground
   net primary productivity (ANPP) and soil C sequestration were, however,
   unrelated to these variables. Community aggregated leaf (specific leaf
   area, leaf dry-matter content) and root and rhizome (specific length,
   tissue density, diameter) traits responded (R) significantly to changes
   in disturbance, indicating an increased dominance of conservative plant
   growth strategies at low compared with high disturbance. Applying the
   mathematical framework, ANPP was predicted by distribution of leaf

   correlated with mowing and abandonment of grazing, probably because of
   their ability to outcompete rosette species. There was a negative
   relationship between the number of species and above-ground biomass and
   a positive relationship between number of species and below-ground
   biomass, suggesting that these species-rich communities allocate more to
   below-ground organs when not grazed. The application of fertilizer had
   no effect on species composition but it indirectly increased competitive
   asymmetry for light and increased the number of plant extinctions. It is
   concluded that continuation of cattle grazing is an acceptable form of
   grassland management at the study site and that species and functional
   group compositions can rapidly change with changing environmental
   conditions such as abandonment of grazing or application of fertilizer.}},

Abstract = {{Seed sowing to traditionally managed grasslands has been considered as a
   useful restoration tool at sites where local dispersal is limited. A
   three-year trial in northern Finland sought to answer the following
   questions: 1) can the species richness of semi- natural grassland be
   increased with seed sowing, and 2) is the slow increase in species
   richness under continuous mowing management explained by dispersal and/
   or micro-site limitation? Seeds of eight grassland herbs were sown into
   permanent plots with four treatments(no mowing,June mowing, August
   mowing and soil disturbance). The fate of emerged seedlings was
   monitored for three seasons. Large differences were found between
   different species and treatments. Four species produced a notable amount
   of seedlings. Only two species could establish a permanent population on
   the site, Dianthus deltoides and Prunella vulgaris. Their establishment
   rate in plots with August mowing and soil disturbance was around 10\%.
   As much as 82\% of all observed seedlings emerged in the soil
   disturbance treatment. The study supported dispersal as well as micro-
   site limitation. Dispersal limitation was evidenced by the successful
   germination of 50\% of sown species. The lack of suitable germination
   sites restricted seedling establishment effectively, as exposing mineral
   soil enhanced germination greatly. As the traditional management of
   meadows included July hay cut followed by autumn grazing, gaps were
   created for seedling establishment, the present results suggest that if
   grazing animals are not available gaps to sward should be produced by
   mechanical means. Overall, seed sowing can facilitate restoration of
   impoverished semi- natural grasslands where the species richness has
   decreased due to insufficient management and when local seed sources are
   no longer present. (c) 2009 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. The distribution and abundance of invasive species can be driven by
   both environmental variables and land management decisions. However,
   understanding these relationships can be complicated by interactions
   between management actions and environmental variability, and
   differences in scale among these variables. The resulting
   `context-dependence' of management actions may be well-appreciated by
   ecologists and land managers, but can frustrate attempts to apply
   general management principles.
   2. In this study, we quantify the effects of land management and
   environmental variability at different scales on the occurrence and
   abundance of Hieracium pilosella, a major agricultural weed in New
   Zealand. We used a hierarchical study design and analysis to capture
   relevant scales of variation in management actions and environmental
   heterogeneity, and test hypotheses about how these factors interact.
   3. We show that fertilizing and grazing interact with environmental
   gradients at the scale of management application (farm paddocks) to
   influence the establishment and local abundance of H. pilosella.
   4. We further show that H. pilosella's relationships with fine-scale
   abiotic and biotic factors are consistent with expected mechanisms
   driven by larger-scale management actions. Using data on occurrence and
   local abundance, we tease apart which factors are important to
   establishment and subsequent local spread.
   5. Synthesis and applications. A major challenge for environmental
   scientists is to predict how invasive species may respond to ongoing
   landscape modifications and environmental change. This effort will
   require approaches to study design and analysis that can accommodate
   complexities such as interacting management and environmental variables
   at different scales. Management actions will be more likely to succeed
   when they explicitly account for variation in environmental context.}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Ex-arable fields have been suggested as potential sites for
   re-creation of semi-natural grasslands, but information is still limited
   on the temporal scales needed for the natural assembly of these
   communities and whether colonization is related to dispersal or
   establishment limitation.
   2. We investigated grazed ex-arable fields of different age and adjacent
   semi-natural grasslands in terms of species richness of plants,
   community similarity, colonization pattern and recruitment ability of 16
   sown grassland species. The functional trait distribution of successful
   and unsuccessful colonizing species was compared using five traits
   related to dispersal and persistence: seed mass, seed bank persistence,
   specific leaf area, plant height and potential for lateral spread.
   3. The youngest ex-arable fields had the lowest species richness and
   contained communities with the lowest similarity to semi-natural
   grassland. Species richness and similarity to semi-natural grassland
   both increased with time since grazing started on ex-arable fields, but
   were still significantly lower than in semi-natural grasslands even
   after more than 50 years of grazing.
   4. Colonization was not related to any of the investigated functional
   traits. The rank order of the species in terms of abundance was
   correlated between young and old ex-arable fields suggesting that
   species performance remains the same with field age.
   5. Recruitment after sowing was generally lower in ex-arable fields than
   in semi-natural grasslands, although the basic recruitment ability
   varied between species. Recruitment did not change with field age,
   suggesting that dispersal limitation rather than establishment
   limitation caused the temporal pattern of colonization. However,
   establishment limitation may act as a filter for colonization of all
   ex-arable fields, regardless of their age.
   6. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that the temporal
   scale for natural assembly of semi-natural grassland communities in
   ex-arable fields extends over 50 years, even when source pools are
   nearby. Results suggest that a field age-independent establishment
   limitation, combined with dispersal limitation, cause the delayed
   assembly in ex-arable fields. Management that aims to re-create
   semi-natural grassland communities in ex-arable fields should consider
   introducing seeds or improving germination conditions at the sites.}},

Abstract = {{In the semi-arid steppe rangelands of Central Turkey, Festuca valesiaca

   richness. Grazing significantly changed composition through decreasing
   total plant, forb, grass and E valesiaca covers, while substantially
   increasing T sipyleus cover. Topography, soil and grazing appear to
   impact the dominance of plant communities where F valesiaca and T
   sipyleus prevail. These two dominant species had a significant effect in
   shaping vegetation patterns. Based on regression analysis, alterations
   in species richness with changes in cover of forbs and shrubs were
   evident, and spatial heterogeneity of F. valesiaca and T sipyleus

Abstract = {{Question
   What is the relationship between plant diversity and species turnover in
   coastal dune vegetation plots? How is the long-term change in species
   composition of vegetation plots related to shifts in functional traits,
   and what does it tell us about the dominant processes?
   Location
   Coastal dunes, the Netherlands.
   Methods
   Our data set comprised 52 years of vegetation data from 35 permanent
   plots in grassland/scrub/woodland vegetation. Vegetation dynamics were
   described in terms of changes in species composition and abundance, and
   shifts in 13 functional traits related to resources capture and forage
   quality, regeneration and dispersal.
   Results
   Species turnover in the plots was high, because of local extinction and
   colonization. Species-rich plots were more stable in terms of species
   abundance and composition compared with species-poor plots. Over time,
   the plots converged with respect to their abiotic conditions, as
   reflected by Ellenberg indicator values - indicating that the prevailing
   process was succession. The high species turnover reflected high
   invasibility: accordingly, the relative importance of annuals increased.
   Most newcomer annuals, however, were competitive generalists of little
   conservation value. The functional trait analysis allowed us to unravel
   the complexity of effects of disturbances and succession, and yielded
   information on the processes driving the observed vegetation dynamics.
   Conclusions
   In this study, small-scale species turnover was negatively related to
   species diversity, indicating more stability in species-rich
   communities. Regarding shifts in trait diversity, unifying filters
   appeared to be more dominant than diversifying filters. Counteracting
   this homogenization process poses a challenge for nature management.}},

Abstract = {{Lantana is one of the world's worst weeds of South American origin that
   threatens native biodiversity of forest ecosystems across India. It was
   introduced into India as a garden ornamental and or a biohedge plant in
   the early part of the 19th century and now it has virtually invaded all
   the tropical and subtropical regions of India. Although attempts have
   been made to control Lantana by physical, chemical and biological
   methods, there is no success either in its control or the prevention of
   its spread. No effective management strategy is yet available for the
   containment of this obnoxious alien weed. On the basis of critical
   assessment of the biological and ecological attributes of Lantana that
   enabled it to overcome all the existing management practices, we have
   developed a new management strategy. The new strategy involves (i) its
   removal by cut rootstock method, (ii) weeding of saplings from beneath
   the trees used for perching by generalist birds that disperse the seeds
   throughout their home range and from surface drainage channels
   originating from the area covered by such trees and (iii) ecological
   restoration of weed-free landscapes, preferably to the grassland, or
   forest communities according to the needs of stakeholders to prevent
   reinvasion of the same species or secondary invasion by another alien
   species. The new strategy developed has been implemented successfully in
   demonstration plots of 2-5 hectares at the Corbett Tiger Reserve
   (Uttarakhand), Kalesar National Park (Haryana) and Satpura Tiger Reserve
   (Madhya Pradesh). The advantages of the new management strategy over
   other control methods currently used are: (i) cost effectiveness, (ii)
   simple and easy to adopt and (iii) ensures successful control of Lantana
   without using chemicals and exotic biological control agents, and with
   minimum disturbance of soil.}},

Abstract = {{Past semi-natural grassland extent is thought to have a major influence
   on contemporary species richness in rural landscapes. The loss of
   grasslands over the last 300 years was reconstructed for 12 rural
   landscapes in Sweden, ranging from open modern agricultural landscapes
   to more forested landscapes. Old maps and aerial photographs from 1950s
   and today were used to reconstruct landscape patterns in four time-steps
   to investigate how present plant species richness relates to past
   grassland extent and decline in old and new grassland habitats. The
   relative importance of soil properties on the timing of grassland
   decline was assessed. Plant species occurrence was recorded in managed
   and abandoned grassland habitats in each landscape.
   Past and present grassland distribution was a major factor in
   determining plant species patterns found in grasslands today. All
   landscapes had an average of 80\% grassland 300 years ago. Since then
   grassland has declined by 90\% across all landscapes. Proportion of clay
   soils influenced the timing of grassland decline, where grasslands in
   landscapes dominated by clay soils were conversed to crop-fields more
   than 100 years ago. Grasslands on coarser soils declined later,
   primarily to forest. Landscapes with more than 10\% semi-natural
   grassland left today had 50\% higher species richness in all grasslands,
   including both abandoned and new grassland. Time since major grassland
   decline also seems to have an effect on the landscapes' species
   richness. The results show that plant species patterns in grasslands at
   local scales are determined by broader landscape processes which may

Abstract = {{The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge on suitability
   and sustainability of grassland biomass for combustion. In the first
   section grassland management for solid biofuel as well as information on
   harvest, postharvest and firing technology are described. An extensive
   grassland management system with one late cut and low level of
   fertilization is favored for grass as a solid biofuel. The grass harvest
   usually involves drying in the held and clearing with conventional farm
   machinery. Pelleting or briquetting improves the biofuel quality. Grass
   combustion is possible as stand-alone biomass-firing or co-firing with
   other fuels. Firing herbaceous biomass requires various specific
   adaptations of the different combustion technologies. In the second
   section economic and environmental aspects are discussed. Costs for
   biomass supply mainly depend on yields and harvesting technologies,
   while combustion costs are influenced by the size and technical design
   of the plant. Market prices for grass and possible subsidies for land
   use are crucial for profitability. Regarding biogeochemical cycles a
   specific feature of combustion is the fact that none of the biomass
   carbon and nitrogen removed at harvest is available for return to the
   grassland. These exports can be compensated for by fixation from the air
   given legumes in the vegetation and sufficient biomass production.
   Greenhouse gas emissions can be considerably reduced by grass
   combustion. Solid biofuel production has a potential for predominantly
   positive impacts on biodiversity due to the extensive grassland
   management. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   endangered invertebrate, intensively studied throughout Europe and
   protected by the EU Habitat Directive. While surveying P. arion at the
   westernmost outskirts of the Carpathians (Javorniky and Vsetinske Mts.),
   within a stronghold of the species in the Czech Republic, we asked
   whether occupied sites differed from unoccupied ones in the composition
   of vascular plants and butterfly assemblages. The occupied sites (n =
   65) were small pastures, including abandoned ones, with S to W exposure,
   located on rugged terrain and displaying a high microtopographic
   heterogeneity; the unoccupied sites (n = 101) were typically mown or
   intensively grazed. The vegetation of occupied sites was characteristic
   for non-intensive submountain pasture, butterfly assemblages were
   species richer, contained more specialised species, and significantly
   higher proportion of red-listed species. P. arion thus may act as an
   umbrella for a high number of species associated with traditional land

Abstract = {{High amounts of phosphorus (P) are in soil of former farmland due to
   previous fertilizer additions. Draining these residues would provide
   conditions for grassland plant species diversity restoration amongst
   other ecosystem benefits. Nitrogen (N) fertilization followed by cutting
   with subsequent removal of biomass has been suggested as a P residue
   removal method. We present a general model of N and P ecosystem cycling
   with nutrients coupled in plant biomass. We incorporate major P pools
   and biological and physico-chemical fluxes around the system together
   with transfers into and out of the system given several decades of
   management. We investigate conditions where N addition and cutting
   accelerate fertilizer P draining. Cutting does not generally accelerate
   soil P depletion under short-term management because the benefits of
   biomass removal through decreased P mineralization occur on too long a
   timescale compared to cutting's impact on the ability of plants to
   deplete nutrients. Short-term N fertilization lowers soil fertilizer P
   residues, provided plant growth remains N limited. In such situations, N
   fertilization without biomass removal increases soil organic P. Some
   scenarios show significant reductions in available P following N
   addition, but many situations record only marginal decreases in
   problematic soil P pools compared to the unfertilized state. We provide
   explicit conditions open to experimental testing. Cutting might have
   minimal adverse impacts, but will take time to be successful. N
   fertilization either alone or in combination with cutting is more likely
   to bring about desired reductions in P availability thus allowing
   grassland restoration, but might have undesired ecosystem consequences.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of experimental nitrogen (N) additions (0, 12.5, and 50 kg N
   ha(-1) y(-1)) on long-term (12 years) understorey vegetation dynamics
   were examined in a boreal forest. The results showed that two types of
   natural enemies of the dominant dwarf-shrub Vaccinium myrtillus
   (pathogenic fungus of the species Valdensia heterodoxa and herbivorous
   larvae of the genus Operophtera) influenced the vegetation dynamics. The
   pathogenic fungus, causing premature leaf-shed of V. myrtillus, showed a
   strong positive N response during the initial 5-year period. For the
   larvae, a relatively modest N response was overshadowed by an almost
   40-fold population increase during an outbreak event that followed the
   initial 5-year period. This outbreak occurred irrespective of N
   addition, resulting in V. myrtillus decline and depriving the pathogenic
   fungus of its substrate. Hence our study demonstrates that vegetation
   dynamics in this relatively species poor and seemingly simple ecosystem
   are driven by complex biotic interactions. Further, we show that an
   important component of these interactions is the temporal alternation of
   the two natural enemies and, resultant regulation of the dominant
   plant's abundance. Finally, we emphasize that long-term data are
   essential to capture the complexity of this type of biotic interactions.
   In our case, a short-term study may have resulted in markedly different
   conclusions regarding effects of N enrichment and the role of biotic
   interactions for forest vegetation dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Abandonment of grasslands is a major threat for the conservation of
   biodiversity in Europe. The response of butterflies towards secondary
   succession has been studied in northern temperate grasslands, but always
   by comparing sites at different seral stages.
   Here, we present a trajectory study based on the monitoring of
   butterflies from a series of abandoned grasslands in northeast Spain.
   One additional meadow was traditionally managed for the whole 8-year
   sampling period and provided a useful control. Both general changes at
   the community level and species population trends were documented
   through standardised transect counts.
   The increase in turf height was neither accompanied by an increase in
   butterfly diversity nor by consistent trends in body size, dispersal
   ability and host-plant specialization. However, there was a significant
   decrease in habitat specialization, consistent with the hypothesis that
   richness in generalist herbivores is more dependent on biomass
   production than on plant richness. The number of generations decreased,
   in line with the hypothesis that species living in habitats subjected to
   greater disturbance need higher reproductive rates.
   Butterfly communities underwent substantial changes, as indicated by
   composition similarity and species population trends. Grassland
   specialists were forced to disperse from the abandoned meadows and
   search for refugial habitats, allowing the establishment of new
   populations in the contiguous managed meadow.
   Our study shows that grassland abandonment had immediate strong effects
   on butterflies, acting as an excellent indicator of habitat change. It
   also points out to the substitution of grassland specialists by common
   butterflies, less important for conservation purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture is the major land use at a global scale. In addition to food
   production, multifunctionality of landscapes, including values and
   ecosystem services like biodiversity, recreation and culture, is now
   focus for management. This study explores how a scenario approach,
   involving different stakeholders, may help to improve landscape
   management for biodiversity conservation. Local farmers and executives
   at the County Administrative Board were invited to discuss rural
   development and conditions for farmland biodiversity in two Swedish
   landscapes. The potential biodiversity for three future land use
   scenarios for the two landscapes was discussed: nature conservation,
   outdoor recreation and energy production, and compared with current and
   historical landscapes in each region.
   Analyses of habitat areas, connectedness and landscape diversity
   suggested that the energy and recreation scenarios had a negative impact
   on farmland biodiversity, whereas the nature conservation scenario, the
   current and historically reconstructed landscapes had a higher potential
   for biodiversity. The farmers appreciated the nature conservation
   scenario, but also the energy production scenario and they highlighted
   the need of increased subsidies for management of biodiversity. The
   farmers in the high production area were less interested in nature
   quality per se. The executives had similar opinions as the farmers, but
   disagreed on the advantages with energy production, as this would be in
   conflict with the high biodiversity and recreational values. The local
   physical and socio-economical conditions differ between landscapes and
   potentially shaped the stakeholders emotional attachment to the local
   environment, their opinions and decisions on how to manage the land. We
   stress the importance of incorporating local knowledge, visions and
   regional prerequisites for different land uses in conservation, since
   site and landscape specific planning for biodiversity together with a
   flexible subsidy system are necessary to reach the conservation goals

   contrast, for deciduous pastures, the results suggest a trend of high
   sapling presence with intermediate tree cover. These results are
   consistent with the hypothesis that woody vegetation within grazing
   areas may facilitate natural tree recruitment around reserves.
   Furthermore, these vegetation cover results suggest that within the

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment of mountain grasslands has boosted
   grasses and fast-growing unpalatable plants at the expense of

   potential tool to reduce nutrient availability and aboveground
   productivity without destroying the perennial vegetation is carbon (C)
   addition. However, little is known about its suitability under severe
   climatic conditions. Here, we report the results of a 3-year field study
   assessing the effects of sawdust addition on soil nutrients, aboveground
   productivity, and vegetational composition of 10 grazed and ungrazed
   mountain grasslands. Of particular interest was the effect of C addition
   on grasses and on the tall unpalatable weed Veratrum album. After 3
   years, soil pH, ammonium, and plant-available phosphorus were not
   altered by sawdust application, and nitrate concentrations were
   marginally higher in treatment plots. However, the biomass of grasses
   and forbs (without V. album) was 20-25\% lower in sawdust-amended plots,
   whereas the biomass of V. album was marginally higher. Sawdust addition
   reduced the cover of grasses but did not affect evenness, vegetation
   diversity, or plant species richness, although species richness
   generally increased with decreasing biomass at our sites. Our results
   suggest that sawdust addition is a potent tool to reduce within a
   relatively short time the aboveground productivity and grass cover in

Abstract = {{A key challenge of conservation management in seminatural grasslands is

   maintain the ecological functionality and biodiversity of a community.
   We studied changes in the plant functional trait composition and
   diversity of the flooded meadow in the 6-year field experiment in Soomaa
   National Park, Estonia. Five management regimes were introduced:
   traditional (cutting with a scythe and hay removal), mowing (machine
   cutting and hay removal), mulching (machine cutting without hay
   removal), spring burning and unmanaged control. Unmanaged and burned
   plots differed from cut plots due to their higher percentage of grasses
   and sedges, and of C-strategists, and by lower percentage of trampling-
   and grazing-tolerant species, erosulate species, and vegetatively mobile
   guerrilla species. Removal of litter enhanced rosette species and
   winter-green species. Traditional management increased the compositional
   variability among plots. Species richness remained almost constant in
   burned plots, and fluctuated in unmanaged plots, while in all cut plots
   there was a significant increase in species richness. Within cutting
   treatments, richness increased relatively more in the plots that were
   cut by a machine. Results from the 6-year field experiment suggest that
   mulching is the most cost-effective management regime in floodplain
   meadows, but only in combination with mowing (cutting with removal of
   the hay crop) every second or third year, providing the best management
   practice in the long run.}},

Abstract = {{Questions
   How does disturbance and successional age influence richness, size and
   composition of the soil seed bank? What is the potential contribution of
   the soil seed bank to the plant community composition on sites differing
   in their successional age or disturbance intensity?
   Location
   Experimental Botanical Garden of Gottingen University, central Germany.
   Methods
   Above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank were studied on formerly
   arable fields in a 36-year-old permanent plot study with five
   disturbance intensities, ranging from yearly ploughing via mowing to
   long-term uninterrupted succession. We compared species compositions,
   seed densities and functional features of the seed bank and above-ground
   vegetation by using several methods in parallel.
   Results
   The seed bank was mainly composed of early successional species typical
   of strongly disturbed habitats. The difference between seed bank
   composition and above-ground vegetation decreased with increasing
   disturbance intensity. The species of greatest quantitative importance
   in the seed bank was the non-native forb Solidago canadensis.
   Conclusions
   The ability of a plant community to regenerate from the soil seed bank
   dramatically decreases with increasing time since abandonment
   (successional age) and with decreasing disturbance intensity. The
   present study underlines that plant species typical of grasslands and
   woodlands are limited by dispersal capacity, owing to low capacity for
   accumulation of seeds in the soil and the fact that most species do not
   build up persistent seed banks. Rare and target species were almost
   absent from the seed bank and will, after local elimination, depend on
   reintroduction for continuation of their presence.}},

Abstract = {{Scenario planning should be an effective tool for developing responses
   to climate change but will depend on ecological assessments of broad
   enough scope to support decision-making. Using climate projections from
   an ensemble of 16 models, we conducted an assessment of a midcontinental
   area of North America (Minnesota) based on a resistance, resilience, and
   facilitation framework. We assessed likely impacts and proposed options
   for eight landscape regions within the planning area. Climate change
   projections suggest that by 2069, average annual temperatures will
   increase 3 degrees C with a slight increase in precipitation (6\%).
   Analogous climate locales currently prevail 400-500 km SSW. Although the
   effects of climate change may be resisted through intensive management
   of invasive species, herbivores, and disturbance regimes, conservation
   practices need to shift to facilitation and resilience. Key resilience
   actions include providing buffers for small reserves, expanding reserves
   that lack adequate environmental heterogeneity, prioritizing protection
   of likely climate refuges, and managing forests for multi-species and
   multi-aged stands. Modifying restoration practices to rely on seeding
   (not plants), enlarge seed zones, and include common species from nearby
   southerly or drier locales is a logical low-risk facilitation strategy.
   Monitoring ``trailing edge{''} populations of rare species should be a
   high conservation priority to support decision-making related to
   assisted colonization. Ecological assessments that consider resistance,
   resilience, and facilitation actions during scenario planning is a
   productive first step towards effective climate change planning for
   biodiversity with broad applicability to many regions of the world. (C)

Abstract = {{The decline of flower-visiting insects is a threat to ecological

   the Netherlands span approximately 80,000 km and are often covered with
   semi-natural grasslands. As such, they also provide a suitable habitat
   for many insects, but this has received little attention so far. We
   investigated the effects of different management treatments on
   flower-visiting insects. We studied flower visitation in a 3 years old
   experimental set-up with five mowing treatments each replicated five
   times. Management types were: no management and mowing once or twice per
   year with and without the removal of hay, representing common forms of
   management and neglect. During an entire growing season, both flowers
   (number of species and inflorescences) as well as insects (total
   abundance and actual flower visits) were investigated. Mowing twice per
   year with removal of hay showed highest values for all measured
   variables and this effect persisted throughout the growing season. The
   early summer cut proved to be very important for insect feeding
   opportunities, due to the re-flowering of plants later in the growing
   season. Flower abundance showed high correlations with both plant
   species richness and the number of insect visits. Although overall,
   mowing twice a year with hay removal was the most beneficial treatment
   for flower-visiting insects, these plots were entirely devoid of flowers
   for some period right after mowing, indicating that a rotational scheme
   might further promote insect diversity and abundance. (C) 2009 Elsevier

   We use ecological niche models as a first step to identify zones inside

   invasions of three species of Hieracium (hawkweeds) under current and
   future (2030 and 2070) climate scenarios, should current control and

   hawkweeds threaten native tussock grasslands and the grazing industry,

   niche models currently available in the software package BIOMOD, we
   found that these species have yet to realize the extent of their
   climatic distribution under present day climate in Australia. As climate
   change accelerates, the climatic range of hawkweeds was projected to
   contract overall. However, much of the Australian Alps, which contain
   large contiguous tracts of reserves and many endemic species, will
   continue to retain climatically suitable areas for hawkweeds through to

   of southern Africa have only sporadically been exposed to high densities
   of indigenous herbivores and may not be as typically resilient to
   livestock grazing pressure as the savannah and grassland ecosystems of
   semiarid Africa. We investigate this issue by assessing the impacts of
   two contrasting livestock grazing intensities associated with communal
   and commercial ranching systems on the dwarf succulent shrublands of the
   Succulent Karoo in Namaqualand, South Africa. We interpret the results
   in terms of vegetation dynamics and the implications for the current
   debate on nonequilibrium rangelands. The results demonstrate that the
   relative extent of plant community divergence between the communal and
   commercial rangeland has been maintained over the past 10 years, overall
   and within different plant growth forms. Recruitment of certain
   palatable shrub species occurred on the heavily grazed communal
   rangeland, indicating that a further decline in their populations is not
   inevitable. Recruitment of the unpalatable shrub Galenia africana on the
   communal rangeland was disproportionately greater than that of the
   palatable species, reenforcing the dominance of this species. Due to the
   longevity of woody shrubs, short-term vegetation shifts are small,
   limiting the potential for the recovery of overgrazed shrublands during
   periods of low grazing pressure. The shift on the communal rangeland
   toward annuals and geophytes has increased the variability of forage
   production and contrasts with the dominance of dwarf shrubs on the
   commercial rangeland. Shrub-dominated ecosystems create the potential
   for forage storage and inter-annual transfer of excess production,
   buffering livestock numbers in the face of a fluctuating environment.
   Despite the semiarid nature of the area and contrary to the predictions
   of the nonequilibrium theory, livestock and vegetation in Namaqualand
   interact strongly, and a close relationship between livestock numbers
   and primary production persists over the long-term on the communal
   rangeland.}},

Abstract = {{Plant diversity is predicted to be positively linked to the diversity of
   herbivores and predators in a foodweb. Yet, the relationship between
   plant and animal diversity is explained by a variety of competing
   hypotheses, with mixed empirical results for each hypothesis. We sampled
   arthropods for over a decade in an experiment that manipulated the
   number of grassland plant species. We found that herbivore and predator
   species richness were strongly, positively related to plant species
   richness, and that these relationships were caused by different
   mechanisms at herbivore and predator trophic levels. Even more dramatic
   was the threefold increase, from low- to high-plant species richness, in
   abundances of predatory and parasitoid arthropods relative to their
   herbivorous prey. Our results demonstrate that, over the long term, the
   loss of plant species propagates through food webs, greatly decreasing
   arthropod species richness, shifting a predator-dominated trophic
   structure to being herbivore dominated, and likely impacting ecosystem
   functioning and services.}},

Abstract = {{To restore China's degraded environment, the government launched an
   environmental restoration project named the ``Grain for Green{''}
   Project (GGP) in 1999. From 1999 to 2010, the government will spend US\$
   40 billion to convert 147 million ha of farmland into forest and
   grassland and 173 million ha of wasteland (including abandoned farmland)
   into forest in 25 provinces. A primary focus is to replace farming and
   livestock grazing in fragile areas with reforestation and planting of
   forage crops. Given the project's tremendous size and number of
   participants, the attitudes of the affected farmers will strongly
   influence the GGP's success. To learn their attitudes, we surveyed 2000
   farmers in 2005 to quantity their opinions of the GGP and how it has
   affected their livelihoods, and we discuss the concerns raised by these
   attitudes. Farmers appreciated the grain and financial compensation
   offered by the GGP, but few considered planting of trees (8.9\%) or
   forage species (2.2\%) to be a priority. Although only 19.1\% felt that
   their livelihoods had been adversely affected by the GGP and 63.8\%
   supported the project, a large Proportion (37.2\%) planned to return to
   cultivating forested areas and grassland once the project's subsidies
   end in 2018. Therefore, much of the restored vegetation risks being
   converted into farmland and rangeland again, compromising the
   sustainability of the environmental achievements. To succeed, strategies
   such as the GGP must compensate farmers fairly for their costs, create
   new agricultural products and techniques for use on More suitable land,
   and create job and training programs that account for the needs and
   desires of farmers and give them alternatives to returning to old
   land-use practices. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

   texture-contrast profile with a soil pH of 4.0-4.2 in 0.01 M CaCl(2) in
   the 0-20 cm horizon. We found that the site was dominated by two native
   species, the megascolecids Spenceriella macleayi and Spenceriella
   montana, and accompanied by three exotic species, the lumbricid
   Aporrectodea trapezoides, and the acanthodrilids Microscolex dubius and
   Microscolex phosphoreus. Total earthworm abundance varied from 61 to 188
   m(-2). Lime, applied as a treatment, favoured all exotic earthworm
   species: their abundance was 3 times greater in limed soil than in
   unlimed soil. This strongly indicated that severe soil acidity was the
   most likely factor limiting, directly and indirectly, these species at
   this site. In contrast, the responses of the two native species to lime
   varied from negative (S. montana) to non-responsive (S. macleayi),

   Natural selection at Nabawa favoured early flowering of long duration,

   Barker it favoured late flowering of short duration, large leaves and
   long, thick petioles at flowering, thick stems with long internodes,

Abstract = {{The nature of the forages consumed by dairy cows has a large effect on
   both the nutritional and the organoleptic characteristics of the dairy
   products. This paper summarises the results found in the corresponding
   literature. Compared to grazed grass, diets based on maize silage or
   concentrates give rise to milks low in vitamins A and E, in
   beta-carotene, in unsaturated fatty acids, including linolenic acid and
   the conjugates of linoleic acid. but high in saturated fatty acids.
   Besides, maize silage gives cheeses and butters with a whiter colour and
   a firmer consistence, which are generally less appreciated by the
   tasters. The effects of grass are all the more important as it is
   utilized at an earlier stage, and they are influenced by the method of
   conservation and by the botanical composition. Important differences
   among the organoleptic and nutritional characteristics are also observed
   in the dairy products when the cows are fed a diet based on conserved
   grass, or when they are left to graze in spring. As compared to hay,
   grass silage, when properly made, influences but little, or not at all,
   the organoleptic qualities of the cheeses, were it not for their colour,
   which is yellower with silage, because of the higher beta-carotene
   content of the silage. Milks from silage-fed cows are also richer in
   vitamin E, but less rich in linolenic acid. Several recent trials have
   evidenced an effect of the floristic makeup of the forages ingested by
   dairy cows on the texture and the flavour and savour of the cheeses.
   Moreover, when the cows graze a floristically diversified sward, the
   milks and the cheeses are poorer in beta-carotene, but richer in
   linolenic acid and the conjugates of linoleic acid, a fact supposedly
   due to the secondary metabolites present in certain plant species acting
   on the bio-hydrogenation in the rumen.}},

   The herbage mass of dry matter (DM), variables describing the nutritive
   value of herbage, composition of the vegetation and mean of Ellenberg's

Abstract = {{P> This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of
   Coincya monensis (L.) Greuter \& Burdet that are relevant to
   understanding its ecological characteristics and behaviour. The main
   topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological
   Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities,
   responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and
   physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and
   disease, history and conservation.
   Coincya monensis is represented in the British flora by two subspecies;
   ssp. monensis is a diploid, endemic taxon largely confined to open,
   coastal, sand dune habitats along the west coast of Britain; ssp.
   cheiranthos is a tetraploid neophyte (alien) of ruderal and coastal
   habitats.
   Both subspecies occur as short-lived perennials in outbreeding,
   insect-pollinated populations in open, early successional communities.
   Individuals may perennate as hemicryptophytes with buds in basal
   rosettes or as chamaephytes with buds in aerial shoot rosettes, but
   adequate seed production is essential for the long-term maintenance of
   populations. Seed production by the much larger and more floriferous
   tetraploid alien populations is much greater than that of the native
   endemic populations.
   Neither subspecies is able to compete effectively in late successional,
   grassland communities. Coincya monensis ssp. monensis benefits from
   moderate disturbance by trampling, which helps to maintain open, sandy,
   semi-fixed dune communities, such as those dominated by Marram Grass
   (Ammophila arenaria).
   Coincya monensis ssp. monensis has been designated a scarce plant in the
   British flora and is a priority species in the UK Biodiversity Action
   Plan. The main threats to its conservation are loss of habitat through
   natural successional processes and urban development. Coincya monensis
   ssp. cheiranthos is well-established in South Wales where it appears to
   be undergoing a range expansion. At present there are no known mixed
   populations of the two subspecies but this remains a possibility if the
   alien subspecies continues to expand its range. Competition and
   hybridisation between subspecies in mixed populations will present
   additional problems in the conservation of endemic biodiversity in the
   British Flora.}},

   ecosystems throughout the world. and frequently alters above and
   belowground primary productivity, hydrology, and soil microbial biomass
   and activity. However. there is little known regarding the impact of
   this geographically widespread vegetation change on the biodiversity and
   trophic structure of soil fauna. Nematodes represent a major component
   of the soil microfauna whose community composition and trophic structure
   could be strongly influenced by the changes in ecosystem structure and
   function that accompany woody encroachment. Our purpose was to
   characterize nematode community composition and trophic structure along
   a grassland to woodland chromosequence in the Rio Grande Plains of
   southern Texas. Research was conducted at the La Copita Research Area
   where woody encroachment has been documented previously. Soil cores
   (0-10 cm) were collected in fall 2006 and spring 2007 from remnant
   grasslands and woody plant stands ranging in age from 15 to 86 years,
   and nematodes were extracted by sugar centrifugation. Neither nematode
   densities (3200-13,800 individuals kg(-1) soil) nor family richness
   (15-19 families 100 g(-1) soil) were altered by woody encroachment.
   However, family evenness decreased dramatically in woody stands >30
   years old. This change in evenness corresponded to modifications in the
   trophic structure of nematode communities following grassland to
   woodland conversion. Although root biomass was 2-5 x greater in wooded
   areas, root-parasitic nematodes decreased from 40\% of all nematodes in
   grasslands to <10\% in the older wooded areas, suggesting the quality
   (C:N or biochemical defenses) of woody plant root tissue could be
   limiting root-parasites. In contrast, bacterivores increased from 30\%
   of nematodes in grasslands to 70-80\% in older woody patches. This large
   increase in bacterivores may be a response to the 1.5-2.5 x increase in
   soil microbial biomass (bacteria + fungi) following woody encroachment.
   Therefore, while energy flow through grassland nematode communities
   appears to be distributed nearly equally among herbivory, fungivory and
   bacterivory, the energy flow through nematode communities in wooded
   areas appears to be based primarily on bacterivory. We speculate that
   these shifts in nematode community composition and trophic structure
   could have important implications for ecosystem patterns and processes.
   First, the low abundance of root-parasitic nematodes (and presumably
   root herbivory) under woody plants may be one mechanism by which woody
   plants are able to establish and compete effectively with grasses during
   succession from grassland to woodland. Second, the large increase in
   bacterivores following woody encroachment likely accelerates microbial
   turnover and the mineralization of N, thereby providing a feedback that
   enables the persistence of N-rich woody plant communities. (C) 2009

   practices on mountain meadow plant biomass, species richness and
   diversity. The experiment was carried out in the Bohemian Forest Mts. at
   the altitude of 1150-1170 m for 10 years. We applied three treatments
   (mowing, mulching - i.e., cutting and crushing of the sward into small
   pieces which are left at the site to decompose, abandonment - fallow) to
   a mountain meadow with dominant Deschampsia cespitosa, Agrostis
   capillaris, Festuca rubra and Hypericum maculatum. The aboveground
   biomass was significantly highest in the fallow treatment and lowest in
   the mown one, the belowground biomass was the lowest in the fallow
   treatment and the highest in the mown one. The litter accumulation was
   higher in the fallow treatment than in the mulched one, where,
   nonetheless, the mulched material persisted for more than one growing
   season.
   The treatments significantly affected the plant species diversity and
   shifts of dominance among certain species were observed. Decrease of the
   species richness was observed in the fallow plot while, slightly lowered
   Shannon diversity and evenness were observed in the mown plot. If
   regular mowing of mountain meadows is not feasible for economic or
   technical reasons, mulching can represent an economically advantageous
   alternative. It will temporarily check the successional changes that
   sooner or later occur in meadows left fallow. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

   Location: Zazriva-Plesiva (19 degrees 11'N, 49 degrees 16'E),
   north-western Slovakia, western Carpathians.
   Methods: Pairs of experimental plots (mown and unmown) were established
   to replicate each combination of dry/wet and traditionally
   managed/abandoned meadows. Changes in species composition were studied
   over 5 years. The data on changes in species composition was analysed by
   constrained and unconstrained ordinations, and visualized using
   Principal Response Curves,
   Results: Species composition of newly abandoned wet grasslands was
   changing towards the corresponding long-abandoned plots even in the
   first year of abandonment. Similarly, newly established restoration
   mowing in abandoned dry grasslands rapidly shifted the stand species
   composition towards that of traditionally managed ones. Nevertheless, 4
   year after reintroduction of mowing, the species composition of the
   restored plots was still far from the target composition. The effect of
   mowing in abandoned wet grasslands and abandonment in dry grasslands was
   much less pronounced and slower.
   Conclusions: Moisture regime is a very important factor determining the
   management needs of various grassland types. Wet grasslands are much
   more sensitive to abandonment, with a rapid degradation rate and limited
   possibilities for restoration, which can be extremely slow. Even in the
   dry grasslands, that quickly responded to restoration mowing,
   restoration is a long-term process.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: What are the effects of raised water levels on wet grassland
   plant communities and dynamics? To what extent do time since raised
   water levels, vegetation management and water regime influence community
   composition?
   Location: Pevensey Levels, southeast England, UK.
   Methods: Plant communities and hydrology were monitored during 2001-03
   within 23 wet grassland meadows and pastures where water levels had been
   raised for nature conservation at different times over 21 years.
   Community variations were examined using species abundance and
   ecological traits.
   Results: Water regime, measured as duration of flooding, groundwater
   level and soil moisture was significantly related to plant community
   variation. Communities were divided into grasslands where inundation was
   shallow (<= 8cm) and relatively short (<= 3 months) and sites where
   deeper flooding was prolonged (>= 5 months), supporting a variety of
   wetland vegetation. With increasing wetness, sites were characterised by
   more bare ground and wetland plants such as sedges, helophytes and
   hydrophytes, and species with a stress-tolerating competitive strategy.
   All sites showed considerable annual dynamics, especially those with
   substantially raised water levels. There were no significant
   relationships between time since water levels were raised and plant
   community composition. Grassland management exerted a limited influence
   upon vegetation compared to water regime.
   Conclusions: Grassland plant communities are responsive to raised water
   levels and have potential for a rapid transition to wetland vegetation,
   irrespective of grazing or cutting management. Creation or restoration
   of wet grasslands by (re)wetting is feasible but challenging due to the
   high dynamism of wetland plant communities and the need for
   substantially raised water levels and prolonged flooding to produce
   significant community changes.}},

Abstract = {{The role of facilitation in the structuring of plant communities has
   been often demonstrated in environments under high abiotic stress,
   especially in semi-arid and arid ecosystems and high elevations. Few
   studies, however, analysed facilitation in systems that are highly
   productive and rich in species, which are thought to be theoretically
   unlikely to demonstrate strong effects of facilitation. Here, we
   investigate the importance of Eryngium horridum, a rosette species, on
   the maintenance of plant diversity in subtropical grasslands in southern
   Brazil. We evaluated facilitation in areas under two different types of
   management: abandonment and grazing. Plots were established in areas
   with and without individuals of E. horridum and all species were
   identified and had their cover estimated. The Relative Neighbour Effect
   index was calculated in order to verify the presence of competition or
   facilitation. Our results indicated facilitation in both abandoned and
   in grazed grasslands, but apparently through different mechanisms. In
   the first case, the plant's architecture opens the canopy and allows
   more light to reach small forbs in the grass matrix. In the second case,
   E. horridum appears to protect more palatable species from herbivores.
   Otherwise considered an obnoxious species, E. horridum plays an
   important ecological role in subtropical grasslands in southern Brazil
   by facilitating other species and consequently, increasing local
   richness. Areas with this rosette species are important sources of
   diaspores, which are able to colonize new open sites and thus, maintain

Abstract = {{Loss of biodiversity poses one of the greatest threats to natural
   ecosystems throughout the world. However, a comprehensive understanding
   of the impacts of species losses from upper trophic levels is still
   emerging. Here we compare the impacts of large mammalian herbivore
   species loss on grassland plant community structure and composition in a
   South African and North American grassland. Herbaceous plant communities
   were surveyed at sites without large mammalian herbivores present and at
   sites with a single species of herbivore present in both locations, and
   additionally at one site in South Africa with multiple herbivore
   species. At both the North American and South African locations, plant
   communities on sites with a single herbivore species were more diverse
   and species rich than on sites with no herbivores. At the
   multi-herbivore site in South Africa, plant diversity and richness were
   comparable to that of the single herbivore site early in the growing
   season and to the no herbivore site late in the growing season. Analyses
   of plant community composition, however, indicated strong differences
   between the multi-herbivore site and the single and no herbivore sites,
   which were more similar to each other. In moderate to high-productivity
   ecosystems with one or a few species of large herbivores, loss of
   herbivores can cause a significant decrease in plant diversity and
   richness, and can have pronounced impacts on grassland plant community
   composition. In ecosystems with higher herbivore richness, species loss
   may also significantly alter plant community structure and composition,

Abstract = {{1. Most ecological processes at the population and community level act
   on multiple spatial scales. We identified the influence of grassland
   management, vegetation traits and landscape on orthopteran and butterfly
   diversity in 44 meadows located in a forest-dominated region in the
   Italian Alps. The meadows were sampled in landscapes characterised by
   different proportions of woody vegetation and grasslands quantified at
   11 spatial scales (95-3000 m).
   2. We applied a multi-scale approach to investigate the scale-dependent
   effects of landscape. Then, we built generalised linear models (Poisson
   and log-link function) to test simultaneously vegetation traits and
   landscape variables on insect species richness.
   3. High fertilisation and cutting frequency created tall, species-poor
   plant communities. This change reduced orthopteran diversity by
   providing an unsuitable sward structure, and butterfly diversity by
   creating disturbed plant communities with low species richness and
   abundance of flowering forbs and host plants.
   4. The proportion of woody vegetation had a strong positive effect on
   the richness of both groups at the smallest spatial scale (95 m),
   indicating the importance of undisturbed vegetation in the surrounding
   of mown meadows. The effect tended to disappear with increasing spatial
   extent.
   5. A multi-scale approach was necessary to identify the effects of
   landscape factors in this study system. Conservation measures should
   endorse the maintenance of species-rich, sparse and short plant
   communities by reducing organic fertilisation and cutting frequency.
   However, these schemes should also promote the presence of undisturbed
   woody vegetation in the immediate surrounding landscape or at least
   should prevent the complete mowing of large areas.}},

Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Management of lowland mesotrophic grasslands in north-west Europe
   often makes use of inorganic fertilizers, high stocking densities and
   silage-based forage systems to maximize productivity. The impact of
   these practices has resulted in a simplification of the plant community
   combined with wide-scale declines in the species richness of grassland
   invertebrates. We aim to identify how field margin management can be
   used to promote invertebrate diversity across a suite of functionally
   diverse taxa (beetles, planthoppers, true bugs, butterflies, bumblebees
   and spiders).
   2. Using an information theoretic approach we identify the impacts of
   management (cattle grazing, cutting and inorganic fertilizer) and plant
   community composition (forb species richness, grass species richness and
   sward architecture) on invertebrate species richness and body size. As
   many of these management practices are common to grassland systems
   throughout the world, understanding invertebrate responses to them is
   important for the maintenance of biodiversity.
   3. Sward architecture was identified as the primary factor promoting
   increased species richness of both predatory and phytophagous trophic
   levels, as well as being positively correlated with mean body size. In
   all cases phytophagous invertebrate species richness was positively
   correlated with measures of plant species richness.
   4. The direct effects of management practices appear to be comparatively
   weak, suggesting that their impacts are indirect and mediated though the
   continuous measures of plant community structure, such as sward
   architecture or plant species richness.
   5. Synthesis and applications. By partitioning field margins from the
   remainder of the field, economically viable intensive grassland
   management can be combined with extensive management aimed at promoting
   native biodiversity. The absence of inorganic fertilizer, combined with
   a reduction in the intensity of both cutting and grazing regimes,
   promotes floral species richness and sward architectural complexity. By
   increasing sward architecture the total biomass of invertebrates also
   increased (by c. 60\% across the range of sward architectural measures
   seen in this study), increasing food available for higher trophic
   levels, such as birds and mammals.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivores shape plant communities through selective foraging. However,
   both herbivore selectivity and the plant's ability to tolerate or resist
   herbivory may depend on the density of herbivores. In an alpine
   ecosystem with a long history of grazing, plants are expected to respond
   to both enhanced and reduced grazing pressures, and the interaction
   between plant traits and changes in species abundance are expected to
   differ between the two types of alteration of grazing regime. To
   understand the mechanisms behind species response, we investigated the
   relationship between sheep selectivity (measured in situ), plant traits
   and experimentally derived measures of change in species abundance as a
   response to the enhancement (from low to high density) or cessation
   (from low to zero density) of sheep grazing pressure over a six-year
   time period for 22 abundant herb species in an alpine habitat in south
   Norway. Sheep selected large, late-flowering herbs with a low leaf C/N
   ratio. Species that increased in abundance in response to enhanced
   grazing pressure were generally small and had high root/shoot ratios,
   thus exhibiting traits that reflect both resistance (through avoidance)
   and tolerance (through regrowth capacity) strategies. The abundance of
   selected species remained stable during the study period, and also under
   the enhanced grazing pressure treatment. There was, however, a tendency
   for selected species to respond positively to cessation of grazing,
   although overall responses to cessation of grazing were much less
   pronounced than responses to enhanced grazing. Avoidance through short
   stature (probably associated with increased light availability through
   the removal of tall competitors) as well as a certain amount of regrowth
   capacity appear to be the main mechanisms behind a positive response to
   enhanced grazing pressure in this study. The plant trait perspective
   clearly improves our insight into the mechanisms behind observed changes
   in species abundance when the disturbance regime is altered.}},

Abstract = {{Herbicides have been applied extensively on rangelands to reduce forbs
   that were considered undesirable, which has been assumed to lead to an
   increase in grass production and ultimately to an improvement in
   livestock performance. While scores of research Studies support the
   premise that forb suppression can increase desirable forage on
   plot-level studies, only a few studies have attempted to quantify the
   effect on livestock production within experimental units equivalent in
   area to production-scale pastures. We therefore tested the effect of
   herbicide on mixed prairie vegetation and oil livestock gain on pastures
   typical in area, stocking rate, and composition to working ranches in
   the region. Picloram and 2,4-D at 0.15 and 0.56 kg/ha, respectively,
   were applied aerially in spring of 2001 and again in spring of 2004 to
   two pastures. Two untreated control pastures were managed identically,
   including grazing management, but were not treated with herbicide.
   Canopy cover by species and cover of bare ground and litter were
   estimated in permanently located plots, and stocker cattle performance
   (average daily gain per head; ADG) and total cattle gain (kg ha(-1))
   were measured from 2000 to 2005. Forb cover was less (P < 0.05) in
   herbicide treated pastures than in control pastures in the year of
   herbicide application (2001 and 2004) and for second growing season
   following the treatment (2 YAT) in the 2004 application. Grass cover
   varied more with annual precipitation than with treatment. Livestock ADG
   and gain ha(-1) did not differ between treatments in any year or across
   years. Livestock production varied among years, reflecting variation in
   growing-season precipitation that is characteristic of non-equilibrium
   rangelands. Herbicide altered the plant community by reducing forb cover
   and increasing grass cover, but livestock production was not altered
   either on an individual basis (gain/head) or on an area basis (gain/ha).
   Livestock production per area (gain/ha) might be increased if grass
   production after herbicide treatment could be predicted reliably.
   However, predicting grass production is notoriously difficult in
   rangeland ecosystems that have high inter-annual variation in
   precipitation. Reliable adjustments in stocking rate to harvest grass
   released from forb competition is unlikely and therefore fraught with
   risk. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The introduction of N-2-fixing white clover (Trifolium repens) in
   grassland is a management measure that may contribute to sustainable
   grassland systems by making them less dependent on inorganic
   fertilizers. However, little is known about the impact of this measure
   on soil biota and ecosystem services. We investigated earthworms,
   nematodes, bacteria and fungi in an experiment in which white
   clover-only and a mixture of grass and white clover without
   fertilization were compared with grass-only with and without
   fertilization.
   In comparison with grass-only, white clover-only had a lower total root
   biomass and a lower C/N-ratio in the above- and below-ground plant
   biomass. These plant characteristics resulted in a lower bacterial
   biomass,a lower fungal biomass, a higher proportion of bacterivorous
   nematode dauerlarvae, a lesser proportion of herbivorous nematodes and a
   greater abundance of earthworms in clover-only.
   The quantity and quality (C/N-ratio) of the above- and below-ground
   plant biomass in the mixture of grass and white clover (20-30\% clover
   in the DM) was comparable with grass fertilized with 150 kg N ha(-1) of
   inorganic fertilizer. Differences between these treatments might show
   specific clover effects in the grass-clover mixture on soil biota other
   than quantity and C/N-ratio of the litter. However, the only differences
   were a higher proportion of bacterivorous nematode dauerlarvae and a
   different nematode community composition in grass-clover.
   The soil structure in white clover-only showed a higher proportion of
   angular blocky elements, a lower penetration resistance, a higher number
   of earthworm burrows, a higher potential N-mineralization and
   respiration than the soil in grass-only. This suggests that clover
   stimulates the ecosystem services of water infiltration and supply of
   nutrients, but is less conducive to soil structure maintenance. The
   grass-clover mixture differed from grass-only in a higher respiration
   and from clover only in a higher percentage of soil crumbs. We suggest
   that when clover is introduced in grassland to reduce the reliance on
   inorganic fertilizer, the mixture of grass and clover maintains the
   positive impact of grass roots on soil structure and increases the
   supply of nutrients via the soil food web. Thus, a grass-clover mixture
   combines the agronomic benefits of the two plant types. (C) 2009

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of five fertilizers (including two adjusted manure
   slurries) and an untreated control on soil biota and explored the effect
   on the ecosystem services they provided. Our results suggest that the
   available N (NO (3) (-) and NH (4) (+) ) in the soil plays a central
   role in the effect of fertilizers on nematodes and microorganisms.
   Microorganisms are affected directly through nutrient availability and
   indirectly through grass root mass. Nematodes are affected indirectly
   through microbial biomass and grass root mass. A lower amount of
   available N in the treatment with inorganic fertilizer was linked to a
   higher root mass and a higher abundance and proportion of herbivorous
   nematodes. A higher amount of available N in the organic fertilizer
   treatments resulted in a twofold higher bacterial activity (measured as
   bacterial growth rate, viz. thymidine incorporation), a higher
   proportion of bacterivorous nematodes, a 30\% higher potential N
   mineralization (aerobic incubation), and 25-50\% more potentially
   mineralizable N (anaerobic incubation). Compared to inorganic
   fertilizer, organic fertilization increased the C total, the N total,
   the activity of decomposers, and the supply of nutrients via the soil
   food web. Within the group of organic fertilizers, there was no
   significant difference in C total, abundances of soil biota, and the
   potential N mineralization rate. There were no indications that farmyard
   manure or the adjusted manure slurries provided the ecosystem service
   ``supply of nutrients{''} better than normal manure slurry. Normal
   manure slurry provided the highest bacterial activity and the highest
   amount of mineralizable N and it was the only fertilizer resulting in a
   positive trend in grass yield over the years 2000-2005. The number of
   earthworm burrows was higher in the treatments with organic fertilizers
   compared to the one with the inorganic fertilizer, which suggests that
   organic fertilizers stimulate the ecosystem service of water regulation
   more than inorganic fertilizer. The trend towards higher epigeic
   earthworm numbers with application of farmyard manure and one of the
   adjusted manure slurries, combined with the negative relation between
   epigeic earthworms and bulk density and a significantly lower
   penetration resistance in the same fertilizer types, is preliminary
   evidence that these two organic fertilizer types contribute more to the
   service of soil structure maintenance than inorganic fertilizer.}},

Pages = {{2931-2942}},

Abstract = {{As woody plants encroach into grasslands, grass biomass, density and
   cover decline as wood plant biomass, density and cover increase. There
   is also a shift in location of the biomass from mostly belowground in
   the grasslands to aboveground in the woodlands. In addition, species
   richness and diversity change as herbaceous species are replaced by
   woody species. This is not a new phenomenon, but has been going on
   continually as the climate of the Planet has changed. However, in the
   past 160 years the changes have been unparalleled. The process is
   encroachment not invasion because woody species that have been
   increasing in density are native species and have been present in these
   communities for thousands of years. These indigenous or native woody
   species have increased in density, cover and biomass because of changes
   in one or more abiotic or biotic factors or conditions. Woody species
   that have increased in density and cover are not the cause of the
   encroachment, but the result of changes of other factors. Globally, the
   orbit of the Earth is becoming more circular and less elliptical,
   causing moderation of the climate. Additional global climate changing
   factors including elevated levels of CO2 and parallel increases in
   temperature are background factors and probably not the principal causes
   directing the current wave of encroachment. There is probably not a
   single reason for encroachment, but a combination of factors that are
   difficult to disentangle. The prime cause of the current and recent
   encroachment appears to be high and constant levels of grass herbivory
   by domestic animals. This herbivory reduces fine fuel with a concomitant
   reduction in fire frequency or in some cases a complete elimination of
   fire from these communities. Conditions would now favor the woody plants
   over the grasses. Reduced grass competition, woody plant seed dispersal
   and changes in animal populations seem to modify the rate of
   encroachment rather than being the cause. High concentrations of
   atmospheric CO2 are not required to explain current woody plant
   encroachment. Changes in these grassland communities will continue into
   the future but the specifics are difficult to predict. Density, cover
   and species composition will fluctuate and will probably continue to
   change. Increased levels of anthropogenic soil nitrogen suggest
   replacement of many legumes by other woody species. Modification and
   perhaps reversal of the changes in these former grassland communities
   will be an arduous, continuing and perhaps impossible management task.

   converted to shrubland. Shrubland has low economic value and provides
   limited ecosystem services but is now the dominant vegetation in three

Abstract = {{Long-term effects of two mechanical interventions, shallow plowing and

   studied. Species composition and standing biomass of the grassland were
   monitored at peak biomass each year for 24 yr after application of these
   two measures, together with grassland in natural recovery and that under
   public grazing. Results showed a high resilience of degraded grassland,
   which recovered naturally after excluding grazing animals to a structure
   similar to the intact L. chinensis community. In comparison with natural
   recovery, harrowing facilitated restoration of L. chinensis population
   and community structure and improved grassland production. Shallow
   plowing accelerated recovery of L. cbinensis population to a larger
   extent than harrowing and led to a flourish of annual species and
   improvement of herbage production in the years following its
   application. But the production improvement was unsustainable and was
   associated with a decrease in grassland species richness and community
   complexity. We conclude that the best measure for restoring degraded
   grassland depends on the restoration objectives and severity of
   grassland degradation. Harrowing is a feasible technique to assist
   restoration of the degraded grassland. In contrast, shallow plowing is

Abstract = {{Wildlife conservationists and agencies have recommended managing

   distribution-oriented grazing management in the spending and applied
   practices of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the

   NRCS applied practices and spending both suggest all emphasis on

Abstract = {{Grazing lands are the most degraded land use type in the world,

   activities such as overgrazing coupled with drought. For restoration of
   degraded grazing lands, large-scale projects are implemented, which
   include extensive vegetation improvements (e.g., reseeding, weed
   control, shrub plantations, reforestations, etc.). Such interventions,
   apart from being very expensive, often create environmental problems. In
   situations where the abiotic function of the degraded grazing land has
   not been irreversibly damaged, application of appropriate grazing
   management is an ecologically viable solution to their restoration. This
   is especially necessary for grazed lands with a long history of grazing
   by large herbivores, including livestock. Excluding domestic animals
   from such ecosystems may lead to several ecological problems such as
   loss of biodiversity and devastating wildfires. Appropriate grazing
   management should include an adjusted stocking rate to the grazing
   capacity of the restored land, the right kind of animal species, and an
   appropriate grazing system. In addition, grazing management should be
   implemented on the basis of a plan that is part of the restoration

Abstract = {{A significant challenge for policy and land management is to alter
   agricultural systems to reduce their detrimental impacts on native
   vegetation and biodiversity habitat. We analysed historical, ecological
   and land use data to understand the threats to native vegetation, and
   prospects for future recovery in the wheat-sheep zone of the Wimmera and
   Mallee in southeastern Australia. We analysed air photos, surveyed 60
   remnant vegetation sites, and interviewed land managers about a subset
   of 35 remnants. Our analysis confirmed that soil types favoured for
   cropping were largely cleared before 1945; mean cover declined from 8\%
   to 5\% between 1945 and 2000. Small patches (<5 ha) account for a
   quarter of remaining woody cover. Cover of crops increased at the
   expense of pasture. Small patches were typically frequently grazed,
   nutrient enriched and were dominated by an exotic annual understorey.
   Recruitment of woody species was uncommon, and non-existent in the small
   patches. Landholders valued small patches primarily for stock shelter
   but without recruitment their long-term persistence is doubtful, even
   though most farmers are grazing less now compared with 30 years ago.
   Meeting regional native vegetation cover targets likely depends on
   retention of all existing vegetation patches, plus considerable
   revegetation. However, although current land use trends allow the
   sparing of some marginal lands while cropping intensifies, this option
   cannot satisfy vegetation cover targets and may not preserve
   biodiversity. More significant gains in native vegetation cover may not
   occur unless new opportunities arise for the current cohort of farmers.

Abstract = {{The central organizing theme of this paper is to discuss the dynamics of
   the Serengeti grassland ecosystem from the perspective of recent
   developments in food-web theory. The seasonal rainfall patterns that
   characterize the East African climate create an annually oscillating,
   large-scale, spatial mosaic of feeding opportunities for the larger
   ungulates in the Serengeti; this in turn creates a significant annual
   variation in the food available for their predators. At a smaller
   spatial scale, periodic fires during the dry season create patches of
   highly nutritious grazing that are eaten in preference to the
   surrounding older patches of less palatable vegetation. The species
   interactions between herbivores and plants, and carnivores and
   herbivores, are hierarchically nested in the Serengeti food web, with
   the largest bodied consumers on each trophic level having the broadest
   diets that include species from a large variety of different habitats in
   the ecosystem. The different major habitats of the Serengeti are also
   used in a nested fashion; the highly nutritious forage of the short
   grass plains is available only to the larger migratory species for a few
   months each year. The longer grass areas, the woodlands and kopjes
   (large partially wooded rocky islands in the surrounding mosaic of
   grassland) contain species that are resident throughout the year; these
   species often have smaller body size and more specialized diets than the
   migratory species. Only the larger herbivores and carnivores obtain
   their nutrition from all the different major habitat types in the
   ecosystem. The net effect of this is to create a nested hierarchy of
   subchains of energy flow within the larger Serengeti food web; these
   flows are seasonally forced by rainfall and operate at different rates
   in different major branches of the web. The nested structure that
   couples sequential trophic levels together interacts with annual
   seasonal variation in the fast and slow chains of nutrient flow in a way
   that is likely to be central to the stability of the whole web. If the
   Serengeti is to be successfully conserved as a fully functioning
   ecosystem, then it is essential that the full diversity of natural
   habitats be maintained within the greater Serengeti ecosystem. The best
   way to do this is by controlling the external forces that threaten the
   boundaries of the ecosystem and by balancing the economic services the
   park provides between local, national and international needs. I
   conclude by discussing how the ecosystem services provided by the
   Serengeti are driven by species on different trophic levels. Tourism
   provides the largest financial revenue to the national economy, but it
   could be better organized to provide more sustained revenue to the park.
   Ultimately, ecotourism needs to be developed in ways that take lessons
   from the structure of the Serengeti food webs, and in ways that provide
   tangible benefits to people living around the park while also improving
   the experience of all visitors.}},

Abstract = {{In most parts of the world, pastoral societies are governed by internal
   rules or legal bodies and legal rules (institutions) at the regional and
   national scale. In the Large Scale Grazing Systems (LSGS) of the
   European Union (EU), institutional management is also dependent on EU
   regulations, which underpin a considerable part of total policy support.
   In this research we argue that the effectiveness of policy intervention
   should be determined ``on the ground{''} and taking into account the
   structural and social features of particular LSGS. Under a
   community-based research approach, the main stakeholders (arable farmers
   and landless pastoralists) and organisations governing the cereal-sheep
   farming system in Castilla-La Mancha (South-Central Spain) were
   consulted with the aim of assessing the sustainability of the mixed
   cereal and sheep system. In this area, sheep farming is a secondary land
   use relying on the agricultural residues from arable farming, but
   representing some 35\% of the total value of production farming per land
   unit. Our results showed that regional and EU regulations are
   uncoordinated and uncongenial for the continuity of the mixed cereal and
   sheep operation. They are supported by separate policy schemes, while
   operating on the same land units. Arable farming is more affected by EU
   regulations and corresponding policy support schemes, while sheep
   farming is more regulated by regional institutions. EU support was 32\%
   and 13\% of total farm income for cereal and sheep farmers.
   respectively. Arable farmers received a regulated non-market grazing
   fee. They abide by the law, but have no incentive to facilitate the
   sheep subsystem. The farming practices of sheep farmers are more
   market-driven as the value of production makes up the bulk of their
   total income. However, they are squeezed by strict regional regulations
   when implementing pastoral surviving strategies (mobility,
   accessibility, and diversity of land based resources). Both subsystems
   are following disconnected trends, with increasing cultivation intensity
   in arable farming and the abandonment of shepherding and a consequent
   consolidation of sheep flocks and an increase in indoor feeding. This
   research suggests that sensible institutional management should be
   derived from a proper knowledge of the social and structural features of
   particular grazing systems and the disentangling of their main
   constraints. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most biodiversity studies endeavour to put forward strategies for its

   However, biodiversity preservation strategies should also take into

   structural heterogeneity of the land on which this strategy is
   developed. Agroforestry systems have a tree component that makes this
   heterogeneity more important than in exclusively agronomic systems. This
   paper aims to evaluate the effect of different soil fertility

Abstract = {{Burning has traditionally been used in the southern French Alps to
   maintain open lands for grazing. In the context of land use abandonment,
   prescribed burning may be the only realistic practical tool available to
   oppose encroachment by woody plants in numerous mountainous landscapes.
   Although only recently developed as a modern tool for wildfire
   prevention and management of pastoral grasslands, this practice is now
   becoming widespread, which raises the issue of its impact on the fauna
   in general, and on endangered species in particular. We studied the
   impact of a prescribed fire on the survival and small-scale movements of
   one of the rarest snakes in Europe, the Orsini's viper Vipera ursinii,
   in order to evaluate its potential threat to population sustainability.
   We evaluated the body condition of snakes and the quality of their
   habitat, more precisely the abundance of grasshoppers as the main food
   resource, and the vegetation cover as shelter. About 3.6 ha of a 8.8 ha
   study site was burnt in autumn 2003. Snake population parameters were
   estimated using multi-state capture-mark-recapture methods. We
   demonstrate that burning reduced the survival of the vipers by more than
   half during the first year following the fire. Contrary to what was
   expected, there was no evidence of emigration from the burned to the
   unburned area immediately after the fire. Despite the decrease in
   grasshopper density and vegetation cover in the burned area, there was
   no evidence of mid-term mortality in snakes that could result from an
   increased predation rate or from the reduced body condition of snakes.
   As such high mortality, mainly or entirely due to the direct effect of
   fire, is likely to have large repercussions on population
   sustainability, we suggest several improvements of prescribed fire
   protocols to minimize their impact and strongly emphasize the need for a
   prescribed fire policy that takes into account specific recommendations
   for threatened species like Orsini's viper. The case of the Orsini's
   viper is very typical of conservation problems in open mountain lands,
   and we believe that our research will help determine the most suitable
   approach for long-term conservation of biodiversity in such semi-natural
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{We explored the small-scale plant species mobility in a subhumid native
   grassland subjected to grazing by cattle in south-western Uruguay. We
   established four permanent plots of 40 x 40 cm, divided in 16 x 16
   cells. In each cell, the presence of species was seasonally recorded for
   2 years and annually recorded for 4 years. By nesting the cells, we
   studied the mobility at different scales, from 6.25 cm(2) to 400 cm(2).
   At each scale we measured species richness, cumulative richness and the
   turnover rates of the dominant species. We found that the cumulative
   species richness was an increasing power function, with higher
   accumulation rates with smaller spatial scale. Although species richness
   showed seasonal fluctuations, the mean species richness was constant
   during the study period. We detected significant spatio-temporal
   variability in mobility patterns among species. Certain species showed a
   high capacity to colonize new sites, whereas other species rotate among
   sites that they previously occupied. Grazed communities in Uruguayan
   Campos are structured as a dense matrix of perennials grasses and forbs,
   where vegetative propagation is the main form of growth of the species.
   The small-scale dynamics and the high variability in the mobility
   characteristics could be linked with the diversity of growth forms and
   spatial strategies of the species in this community. We believe that a
   high degree of small-scale spatial dynamics contribute to explain the
   species coexistence and the apparent stability of communities at local

Abstract = {{Our understanding of fire and grazing is largely based on small-scale
   experimental studies in which treatments are uniformly applied to
   experimental units that are considered homogenous. Any discussion of an
   interaction between fire and grazing is usually based on a statistical
   approach that ignores the spatial and temporal interactions on complex
   landscapes. We propose a new focus on the ecological interaction of fire
   and grazing in which each disturbance is spatially and temporally
   dependent on the other and results in a landscape where disturbance is
   best described as a shifting mosaic (a landscape with patches that vary
   with time since disturbance) that is critical to ecological structure
   and function of many ecosystems. We call this spatiotemporal interaction
   pyric herbivory (literal interpretation means grazing driven by fire).
   Pyric herbivory is the spatial and temporal interaction of fire and
   grazing, where positive and negative feedbacks promote a shifting
   pattern of disturbance across the landscape. We present data we
   collected from the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in the southern Great
   Plains of North America that demonstrates that the interaction between
   free-roaming bison (Bison bison) and random fires promotes heterogeneity
   and provides the foundation for biological diversity and ecosystem
   function of North American and African grasslands. This study is
   different from other studies of fire and grazing because the fires we
   examined were random and grazing animals were free to roam and select
   from burned and unburned patches. For ecosystems across the globe with a
   long history of fire and grazing, pyric herbivory with any grazing
   herbivore is likely more effective at restoring evolutionary disturbance
   patterns than a focus on restoring any large vertebrate while ignoring
   the interaction with fire and other disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{1. Habitat fragmentation is considered one of the major threats to

   2. We studied the impact of small-scale grassland fragmentation on
   orthopterans over 7 years in an experiment which allowed us to
   additionally investigate the effect of frequent mowing on Orthoptera
   communities.
   3. Overall, Orthoptera density and species richness increased over time.
   This was likely a result of increased small-scale habitat heterogeneity
   and the provision of a short-turf habitat suitable for xerophilous
   species. The fragmentation affected orthopteran density and species
   composition but not species richness whose response lagged behind the
   changes in abundance.
   4. Responses differed between suborders. Ensifera density was higher in
   fragment than in control plots. Caelifera density did not differ between
   fragment and control plots. The mown matrix was an unsuitable habitat
   for most of the species, particularly within the Ensifera.
   5. Our experiment shows that even small-scale fragmentation can affect
   Orthopteran communities and that the effects became more pronounced over

Abstract = {{Is the red fox a potential vector for epizoochorous seed dispersal? Can
   seed attachment and retention be predicted from plant and seed traits?
   Grasslands in southern Norway.
   Epizoochorous seed attachment on the red fox was studied by walking a
   dummy fox through the vegetation and comparing seeds found on the dummy
   with the estimated seed availability in the vegetation. Seed retention,
   i.e. the ability of different seeds to stay on the fox, was estimated in
   a separate experiment. Seed attachment and retention were related to
   plant and seed traits using statistical models that account for
   heteroscedasticity and zero-inflated data.
   The majority of seeds attached to the fox originated from a few species,
   but also species without specific seed traits that are supposed to
   enhance epizoochory attached at least some seeds to the fox. The
   probability of seed attachment was positively related to plant height,
   bristle and hooked seed appendages, and negatively related to winged
   appendages, seed mass, and seed sphericity. Seed retention was
   positively related to the seed traits bristles, hooks and pappus. For
   several species, the results indicate a high potential for dispersal

   in their mobility or are found at low densities, and other animal
   vectors may therefore be important for seed dispersal. In our study, a
   range of plant species were able to disperse by attaching seeds to, and
   having their seeds retained in, the fox fur some distance. We suggest
   that the red fox may be an important vector for epizoochorous seed
   dispersal in the agricultural landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Metapopulation theory predicts that species richness and total
   population density of habitat specialists increase with increasing area
   and regional connectivity of the habitat. To test these predictions, we
   examined the relative contributions of habitat patch area, connectivity
   of the regional habitat network and local habitat quality to species
   richness and total density of butterflies and day-active moths
   inhabiting semi-natural grasslands. We studied butterflies and moths in
   48 replicate landscapes situated in southwest Finland, including a focal
   patch and the surrounding network of other semi-natural grasslands
   within a radius of 1.5 km from the focal patch. By applying the method
   of hierarchical partitioning, which can distinguish between independent
   and joint contributions of individual explanatory variables, we observed
   that variables of the local habitat quality (e.g. mean vegetation height
   and nectar plant abundance) generally showed the highest independent
   effect on species richness and total density of butterflies and moths.
   Habitat area did not show a significant independent contribution to
   species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. The effect
   of habitat connectivity was observed only for total density of the
   declining butterflies and moths. These observations indicate that the
   local habitat quality is of foremost importance in explaining variation
   in species richness and total density of butterflies and moths. In
   addition, declining butterflies and moths have larger populations in
   well-connected networks of semi-natural grasslands. Our results suggest
   that, while it is crucial to maintain high-quality habitats by
   management, with limited resources it would be appropriate to
   concentrate grassland management and restoration to areas with
   well-connected grassland networks in which the declining species
   currently have their strongest populations.}},

Abstract = {{``Habitats{''} Directive 92/43/EEC is the pivotal European law for
   building a continental network of sites of community importance (SCIs)
   for nature conservation. Article 6 of such directive underlines the
   importance of biodiversity conservation through the realization of
   proper management plans. As a result, such plans are increasingly
   common. A management plan based on intensive field studies and
   monitoring activities requires time and financial resources, which are
   generally limited. The aim of this paper is to offer a rapid,
   cost-effective and scientifically based decision tool aimed to achieve
   GIS-based conservation strategies for habitats of EU interest within
   SCIs and, in general, within protected areas. As a case study, we
   considered species-rich Nardus grasslands (threatened by natural
   reconversion and intensive cattle grazing), and transition mires
   (threatened by pasturing and human disturbance) in a SCI in the Alps.
   Through a multi-criteria evaluation, we selected indicators and weights
   based upon our knowledge of the study area. As a result, we were able
   to: (a) quantify the level of existing threats, (b) suggest urgent
   conservation strategies, and (c) suggest future monitoring activities.
   Since the study area is representative of many protected areas in the
   Alps and the conservation topics under evaluation are frequent threats
   impacting habitats of EU interest, our decision model might be
   transferable to further areas given proper adaptation of weights to the
   intensity and the frequency of current threats.}},

   Cabaneros National Park, Central Spain.
   Diversity components within (alpha) and among (beta) the three main
   vegetation types in the reserve were compared by using a hierarchical
   nested design. These were forests, scrublands and grasslands embedded in
   three different landscapes, where each was the most dominant and
   structurally connected habitat.
   Species richness of grassland habitat did not vary across landscapes,
   but forest habitat showed lower species richness in the
   grassland-dominated landscape. Scrubland was the least species-rich
   habitat, but here again there was no significant variation across
   landscapes. However, in all cases, there was a significant influence of
   habitat context (configuration of habitat patches within landscape
   matrix) on similarity of species composition. These tended to be more
   similar to the dominant landscape matrix where they were embedded,
   rather than to the same habitat type in other landscapes. Additive
   partitioning of diversity showed higher than expected values of beta in
   all landscapes, which indicated a structured response. Highest values of
   beta in the grassland-dominated landscape suggest that this was the

   compensation area (set-aside sown with two different seed mixtures and

   The four plant-cover types differed in species richness as well as in
   the proportions of forbs, grasses and legumes, and annuals and

   between plant-cover types were small, and neither early mowing nor

Abstract = {{Biotic homogenization, with its emphasis on invasions, extinctions, and

   investigating changes in biodiversity across scales. Through their
   selective foraging, large populations of white-tailed deer are altering
   population sizes, driving extirpations, and facilitating invasions of
   plants throughout the eastern United States. I hypothesize that deer can
   drive biotic homogenization in forest understory communities by shifting
   species composition to one dominated by grasses, sedges, and ferns (all
   wind-pollinated plants). I report the effects of 16 years of deer
   exclusion in a hemlock-northern hardwood stand in N Wisconsin using a
   block design. Species composition showed greater convergence in control
   plots than exclosure plots, indicating deer can drive biotic
   homogenization at the stand level. Total percent cover is nearly 4 times
   greater in exclosure plots. Percent cover by woody plants, broadleaf
   herbs, and ferns is 150, 63, and 20 times greater in exclosure plots,
   respectively, while cover by sedges and grasses is 3.8 and 2.2 times
   greater in control plots. Cover by species with showy, insect-pollinated
   flowers is 79 times greater in exclosures. Graminoid-dominated control
   plots represent a novel state not observed fifty years ago, and could
   reflect the emergence of a grazing lawn. The increase in graminoids at
   this study area and throughout the region could under some global change
   scenarios be an early stage of conversion from forest to savanna or wood
   pasture.}},

Abstract = {{Early theories of species diversity proposed that communities at

   communities suggest that many communities are unsaturated and species
   richness can be increased by adding propagules of new species. We
   experimentally tested for community saturation and measured the effects
   of propagule supply on community structure in a benthic marine system.
   We manipulated propagule supply (arrival of individuals of numerous
   species) of mobile grazers in experimental mesocosms over multiple
   generations and, unlike previous tests, we examined the cascading
   effects of propagule supply on prey (macroalgae) biomass. We found
   little evidence for saturation, despite the absence of processes such as
   disturbance and predation that are thought to alleviate saturation in
   nature. Increasing propagule supply increased the total number of
   species and made rare species more abundant. Perhaps surprisingly, given
   the strong effect of propagule supply on species richness,
   supply-related changes in body size and composition suggest that
   competitive interactions remained important. Grazer supply also had
   strong cascading effects on primary production, possibly because of
   dietary complementarity modified by territorial behavior. Our results
   indicate that propagule supply can directly influence the diversity and
   composition of communities of mobile animals. Furthermore, the supply of
   consumer propagules can have strong indirect effects on prey and

Abstract = {{In the framework of a nature conservation project in a wetland region of

   to compare species composition and diversity among wet grasslands under
   the six following types of agricultural land use: pastures used at high
   or low stocking rate, hayfields used at high or low mowing frequency,
   abandoned hayfields and hay pastures. The focus of the study was on the
   effects of grassland management on species diversity and on the
   restriction of occurrence of invasive clonal species. The results show
   that species importance was strongly related to grassland exploitation
   parameters and soil hydrological parameters, as shown by the ordination
   diagram drawn by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Species number
   and importance of non-leguminous dicotyledons were negatively correlated
   to intensity of use, N supply, water table depth and soil drainage.
   Phalaris arundinacea, an invasive species which might reduce species
   diversity, was better suppressed in grazed grassland than in mown
   grassland. Phalaris arundinacea and Cirsium arvense were most prevalent
   in abandoned hayfields. Grazing at low stocking rate was the best
   management technique to maximise plant diversity while restricting
   invasion by nitrophilous clonal species. Although species-rich and of

Abstract = {{For any conservation strategy to be effective, it must be preceded by

   Here, data from 40 savanna-grassland sites were used to examine how
   plant biodiversity and species composition varied across spatial scales
   at the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve (KMTR), south India.
   Grasslands surveyed contained 278 plant species, and were characterized
   by high spatial variability in species association patterns. Fourteen
   distinct community assemblages were identified, organized primarily
   along an elevation gradient in the reserve. Overall, grasslands at KMTR
   were characterized by the dominance of a few, widespread species. The
   bulk of species richness, however, resulted from subordinate species
   with fairly restricted distributions. At low elevations, grasslands had
   high species richness and species composition differed greatly between
   sites. Mid-elevation grasslands contained about half the number of
   species present at low elevations, but sites were more similar in
   species composition. Richness of high-elevation grasslands was a third
   of that found at low elevations, but different sites harbored unique
   sets of species. Herbivore use of grasslands varied between communities
   and showed patterns that coincided with elevation. Herbivore use of
   low-elevation communities was high albeit variable, of mid-elevation
   sites was consistently low, and increased at higher elevations. Tall
   grass communities were the least utilized by herbivores at all
   elevations. Most species surveyed were rare and restricted in their
   distribution suggesting that conservation efforts must, perforce,
   encompass the entire reserve. However, differences in the structuring of
   diversity across elevations, and in herbivore use of grasslands, suggest
   that conservation efforts can be partitioned differentially across

   ha(-1) year(-1)) but it increased strongly with decreasing water table
   (up to 120 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)). Soil N, P and K pools were small in
   the undisturbed mires. Drainage had caused a shift from fen to meadow
   species and the disappearance of bryophytes. Biomass of vascular plants
   increased with increasing N mineralization and soil P. Annual
   hay-removal tended to have reduced N mineralization and soil K pools,
   but it had increased soil P. Moreover, N concentrations in vascular
   plants were not affected, but P and K concentrations and therefore N:P
   and N:K ratios tended to be changed. Annual hay-removal had induced a
   shift from P to K limitation in the severely drained fen, and from P to
   N limitation in the floodplain. The low nutrient availabilities and
   productivity of the undisturbed Biebrza mires illustrate the
   vulnerability of such mires to eutrophication in Poland and elsewhere.
   In nutrient-enriched areas, hay removal may prevent productivity
   increase of the vegetation, but also may severely alter N:P:K
   stoichiometry, induce K-limitation at drained sites, and alter
   vegetation structure and composition.}},

Abstract = {{Zoige Marsh, located in the Northeastern Qianghai-Tibet Plateau, is the
   largest highland marsh in the world. The marsh is one of the hotspots
   for biodiversity, harboring many endemic and endangered species,
   including Grus nigricollis, the only plateau crane. Zoige Marsh has a
   large area of high-quality grasslands, serving as the fifth largest
   livestock base in China, and it is also the major water source to the
   headstream of the Yellow River. However, due to global warming and
   unwise use of the marsh resources, including ditching for grassland
   enlargement, peat exploitation, and livestock grazing, since the 1970s,
   Zoige Marsh has suffered severe ecosystem degradations such as
   vegetation recessive succession, biodiversity loss, soil deterioration,
   and rodent disasters. It is therefore imperative to restore the damaged

Abstract = {{Increased agricultural intensification has led to well-documented
   declines in the fauna and flora associated with intensive grasslands in
   the UK. We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of different field margin
   management strategies for putting bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity
   back into intensive grasslands.
   Using four intensive livestock farms in south-west England, we
   manipulated conventional management practices (addition of inorganic
   fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to
   generate seven grass-based treatments along a gradient of decreasing
   management intensity. We also tested two more interventionist treatments
   which introduced sown components into the sward: (i) a cereal, grass and
   legume mix, and (ii) a diverse conservation mix with kale, mixed
   cereals, linseed and legumes. These crop mixtures were intended to
   provide forage and structural resources for pollinators but were not
   intended to have agronomic value as livestock feed. Using a replicated
   block design, we monitored bumblebee and butterfly responses in 27 plots
   (10 x 50 m) in each farm from 2003 to 2006.
   Bumblebees were most abundant, species-rich and diverse in the sown
   treatments and virtually absent from the grass-based treatments. The
   diverse conservation mix treatment supported larger and more diverse
   bumblebee assemblages than the cereal, grass and legume mix treatment.
   The sown treatments, and the most extensively managed grass-based
   treatments, had the highest abundance, species richness and diversity of
   adult butterflies, whereas butterfly larvae were only found in the
   grass-based treatments.
   Bumblebee and butterfly assemblage structure was driven by floral
   abundance, floral richness, the availability of nectar resources, and
   sward structure. Only vegetation cover was correlated with butterfly
   larval abundance.
   Synthesis and applications. This study has identified management options
   in the margins of intensive grasslands which can enhance bumblebee and
   butterfly biodiversity. Extensification of conventional grass management
   by stopping fertilization, reducing cutting frequency and not grazing,
   benefits butterflies. However, to enhance bumblebees requires a more
   interventionist approach in the form of sowing flower-rich habitat. Both
   approaches are potentially suitable for adoption in agri-environment
   schemes in the UK and Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Calcareous fens are among the most threatened and declining ecosystems
   throughout Europe and act as refugia for many endangered species.
   Traditionally, calcareous fens were mown but many of them have been
   abandoned and invaded by Molinia. This has led to changes in species
   composition, heavy loss in species diversity and a decrease in bryophyte
   cover. Fen restoration is complicated by an effective nutrient uptake
   and utilization of Molinia. Experimental tests of the effects of litter
   removal and different mowing regimes on restoration success are needed
   together with studies that compare the responses of different
   taxonomical groups.
   We applied three different types of restoration measures (once- and
   twice-a-year mowing, litter removal) in a block experiment over 6 years
   to test the effects on species density and composition of vascular
   plants and bryophytes. We used repeated measures anova, RDA with the
   Monte Carlo test and principal response curves.
   Species density and composition of both taxonomic groups were
   significantly influenced by mowing, but not by pure litter removal.
   Contrary to bryophytes, vascular plant species composition was more
   strongly influenced by twice-a-year mowing than by annual mowing.
   Vascular plant species density sharply increased after 2 years in both
   annual and bi-annually mown plots, to a greater extent in the latter.
   Late-spring nutrient concentrations in Molinia varied inconsistently
   across the years, but showed a trend of lower K-concentrations in mown
   plots. The tissue N:P ratio indicated P-limitation.
   Using nine sub-plots within each experimental plot, we found that Bryum
   pseudotriquetrum was able to spread quickly over the mown plots, while
   some other typical fen bryophytes (Fissidens adianthoides, Palustriella
   commutata, Scorpidium cossonii) were unable to increase in frequency,
   perhaps due to a low generative reproduction and weak competitive
   ability.
   Synthesis and applications. Molinia-invaded fen vegetation can be
   restored through intensive mowing. We recommend twice-a-year mowing
   instead of traditional late annual mowing as an initial restoration
   measure. Since the effect of the standing Molinia crop in our
   long-abandoned fen turned out to be more detrimental to other plants
   than accumulated litter, we do not recommend any management that is
   based on litter removal rather than mowing.}},

   of herbaceous and woody plants were higher in the exclosures than in the

   more biomass was produced from the young than the old exclosures. Stern
   height, canopy height, canopy cover, and browsing capacity of woody

   Northern hardwood forests, QuEbec, Canada (45 degrees 01'-45 degrees
   08'N; 73 degrees 58'-74 degrees 21'W).
   Two different trait-based approaches were used to relate plant
   functional traits to succession on an old-field - deciduous forest
   chronosequence: (i) a frequently used approach based on co-occurrence of
   traits (emergent groups), and (ii) a new version of a direct functional
   approach at the trait level (the fourth-corner method). Additionally, we
   selected two different cut-off levels for the herb subset of the
   emergent group classification in order to test its robustness and
   ecological relevance.
   Clear patterns of trait associations with stand developmental stages
   emerged from both the emergent group and the direct approach at the
   trait level. However, the emergent group classification was found to
   hide some trait-level differences such as a shift in seed size, light
   requirement and plant form along the chronosequence. Contrasting results
   were obtained for the seven or nine group classification of the
   herbaceous subset, illustrating how critical is the number of groups for
   emergent group classification.
   The simultaneous use of two different trait-based approaches provided a
   robust and comprehensive characterization of vegetation responses in the
   old-field - deciduous forest chronosequence. It also underlines the
   different goals as well as the limitations and benefits of these two
   approaches. Both approaches indicated that abandoned pastures of the
   northern hardwood biome have good potential for natural recovery.
   Conversion of these lands to other functions may lead to irremediable

   dynamics of subdominant and rare species.
   Basal cover of B. gracilis increased by an average of 1\% per year, but
   there was significantly less plant cover in treatment compared to
   control plots for 5 years following removal. In contrast to the lower
   cover in treatment plots, the plant density (number of plants m(-2)) of
   certain subdominant perennial grasses, herbaceous perennial and annual
   forbs, a dwarf shrub, and cactus increased after removal of the dominant
   species, with no major change in species richness (number of species per
   1 m x 1 m) or diversity. Subdominant species were more similar between
   years than rare species, but dominant removal resulted in significantly
   lower similarity of the subdominant species in the short term and
   increased the similarity of rare species in the long term.
   Removal of B. gracilis, the dominant perennial grass in the shortgrass

Abstract = {{The intermediate disturbance hypothesis (IDH) predicts that species
   diversity is maximized at moderate disturbance levels. This model is
   often applied to grassy ecosystems, where disturbance can be important
   for maintaining vascular plant composition and diversity. However,
   effects of disturbance type and frequency on cover and diversity of
   non-vascular plants comprising biological soil crusts are poorly known,
   despite their potentially important role in ecosystem function. We
   established replicated disturbance regimes of different type (fire vs.
   mowing) and frequency (2, 4, 8 yearly and unburnt) in a high-quality,
   representative Themeda australis-Poa sieberiana derived grassland in
   south-eastern Australia. Effects on soil crust bryophytes and lichens
   (hereafter cryptogams) were measured after 12 years. Consistent with
   expectations under IDH, cryptogam richness and abundance declined under
   no disturbance, likely due to competitive exclusion by vascular plants
   as well as high soil turnover by soil invertebrates beneath thick grass.
   Disturbance type was also significant, with burning enhancing richness
   and abundance more than mowing. Contrary to expectations, however,
   cryptogam richness increased most dramatically under our most frequent
   and recent (2 year) burning regime, even when changes in abundance were
   accounted for by rarefaction analysis. Thus, from the perspective of
   cryptogams, 2-year burning was not an adequately severe disturbance
   regime to reduce diversity, highlighting the difficulty associated with
   expression of disturbance gradients in the application of IDH. Indeed,
   significant correlations with grassland structure suggest that cryptogam
   abundance and diversity in this relatively mesic (600 mm annual
   rainfall) grassland is maximised by frequent fires that reduce
   vegetation and litter cover, providing light, open areas and stable soil
   surfaces for colonisation. This contrasts with detrimental effects of
   2-year burning on native perennial grasses, indicating that this
   proliferation of cryptogams has potentially high functional significance
   for situations where vegetation cover is depleted, particularly for
   reducing soil erosion.}},

Abstract = {{Additive influences of the invasion ability of species (invasiveness)

   tested the hypothesis that different species assemblages of grassland
   communities may partly result from interactive influences between the
   relative invasiveness of available species and community invasibility.
   During 10 months, we evaluated seed and microsite limitation of seedling
   emergence, survival, and recruitment of plants belonging to species with
   different seed size (large-seeded species vs. small-seeded species),
   with in a two-phase community mosaic typical of semi-natural grasslands
   in the southern flooding Pampa of Argentina. Seeds of large versus
   small-seeded species were sown either in species-poor patches dominated
   by a tall tussock grass ({''}pajonal{''}) or in species-rich patches
   dominated by short grasses ({''}matrix{''}), subjected to different
   levels of canopy disturbance (cut vs. uncut). Seed addition promoted
   seedling emergence for 7 out of the 10 species sown, and this effect was
   higher for large than for small-seeded species. After seed limitations
   were removed, interactive effects among seed size, community state and
   canopy disturbance reflected a strong positive influence of seed size on
   plant recruitment only in cut pajonal patches. Therefore, according to
   the stage of invasion process, relative species success may depend on
   non-interactive (seed-size effect on seed limitation to seedling
   emergence) or interactive influences among species invasibility and
   community invasiveness (from seedling emergence to plant recruitment).
   As a general conclusion, different assemblages of species are expected

   grass, Nassella clarazii. Non-native species cover was also higher in
   dung piles than in control plots. Dung piles cover a significant portion
   of grassland area in our study site, produce significant changes in the
   vegetation and are associated with some invasive alien plants that could
   eventually colonize more pristine areas in the vicinity. On the other
   hand, they might represent refuges for palatable species, since horses
   seem to avoid them for grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Legumes are an important component of mediterranean grasslands with a
   significant ecological and economic role. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the factors that affect their establishment and growth and
   how they survive in a highly variable and unpredictable environment. The
   research was carried out in a grassland characterised by a semi-arid
   mediterranean climate and located on a calcareous substrate at about 150
   m a.s.l., in Macedonia, northern Greece. It was dominated by annual
   legumes such as Hippocrepis multisiliquosa, Medicago disciformis,
   Medicago minima, Onobrychis aequindentata, Trifolium angustifolium,
   Trifolium campestre and Trifolium scabrum. It was subjected to the
   following treatments for four consecutive years: prescribed burning,
   irrigation, digging, cutting, P fertilization and control. Total legume
   density was measured in late autumn and in the following spring each
   year, while total legume biomass was measured only in spring. Dominant
   legume species densities and biomasses were measured only in spring in
   the last 3 years. Also, monthly precipitation and air temperature were
   recorded in a nearby weather station. A great reduction of both legume
   density and biomass occurred at the third growing season due to adverse
   weather conditions. Among treatments, P fertilization affected the
   positively annual legume density and biomass. The other treatments such
   as burning, irrigation, digging and cutting influenced positively or
   negatively annual legume density and biomass depending on the climatic
   characteristics of the particular growing season involved. It is
   concluded that in semi-arid mediterranean grasslands with cold winters,
   weather conditions strongly interact with human disturbances in
   affecting establishment and growth of annual legumes.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, temperate grasslands and meadows have sharply declined in
   spatial extent. Loss and fragmentation of grasslands and meadows may
   impact biodiversity, carbon storage, energy balance, and climate change.
   In the Pacific Northwest region of North America, grasslands and meadows
   have declined in extent over the past century. Largely undocumented in
   this regional decline are the grass balds of the Oregon Coast Range,
   isolated grasslands in a landscape dominated by coniferous forests. This
   study was conducted to quantify the spatial extent and patterns of grass
   bald change. Five balds in the Oregon Coast Range were evaluated using
   historical aerial photographs and recent digital orthophoto quadrangles
   (DOQ). Over the time period of study (1948/1953 to 1994/2000), bald area
   declined by 66\%, primarily from forest encroachment. The number and
   average size of bald vegetation patches declined, while edge density
   increased. Tree encroachment into balds was inversely related to
   distance from nearest potential parent trees. Spatial patterns of bald
   loss may result from a forest to bald gradient of unfavorable
   environmental conditions for tree establishment and/or seed dispersal
   limitation. Species dependent on balds may be at risk from loss of bald
   area and increased fragmentation, although metrics of habitat
   fragmentation may not reflect species-specific habitat requirements.
   Tree encroachment patterns and increased bald edge densities suggest
   increasing rates of bald loss in the future. The remote sensing nature
   of this study cannot determine the fundamental causes of bald decline,
   although prior research suggests climate change, cessation of native
   burning, successional changes in response to prior wildfires, and
   cessation of livestock grazing all may have potential influence.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on the effect of fire on lowland heathlands at the
   extreme southern edge of their European distribution (Vauda Nature
   Reserve, NW Italy). Forty-nine plots (50 m radius) were surveyed between
   1999 and 2006. Each year, fire occurrences were recorded and per cent
   cover of four vegetation types (grassland, heath, low shrubland, and
   tall shrubland) was estimated in each plot. Vascular plant species
   richness was also recorded in 255, 1 m(2) quadrats. After a fire,
   grassland vegetation expanded, but then declined rapidly as heath and
   shrubland recovered: 7 years after a fire, tall shrubland encroached on
   to more than 40\% of the plots, and grassland declined from 50\% to 20\%
   cover. Between 1999 and 2006, Betula pendula shrubland greatly expanded,
   while grassland decreased over most of the Reserve, even where fire
   frequency was high. Tall shrubland had low plant diversity and was
   dominated by widespread species of lower conservation value. By
   contrast, early successional vegetation (grassland and low shrubland)
   had higher richness and more narrowly distributed species, indication
   that the development of tall shrubland causes significant species loss
   in the heathland. Italian lowland heathlands are characterized by high
   rates of shrubland encroachment that threatens both habitat and species
   diversity. Burning frequencies of once in 3-6 years seem appropriate in
   this habitat, but burning alone might not suffice without actions to
   increase herbivore grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands in Tanzania are among the world's most biologically productive
   ecosystems and are rich in species diversity. Wetlands support family

   important habitat for biodiversity both flora and fauna. The last 30
   years have witnessed rapid degradation of wetlands which threatens
   livelihoods; disturbs ecological settings and leads into unsustainable

   livelihoods and sustainability issues of the Bahi Wetlands in Central
   Tanzania. This is a semi-arid area and therefore the wetland plays a key
   role socio-economically and environmentally. Data were collected from
   200 households in Ngaiti and Kitalalo villages using structured and
   semi-structured questionnaires. There were also focused groups
   interviews, key informants and Participatory Rural Appraisal methods.
   Findings show Bahi Wetlands to play a significant role in livelihoods,
   cultural and ecological functions. However, the sustainability of the
   wetlands is threatened by over-cultivation, overgrazing and
   over-extraction of natural resources directly. Livelihood
   diversifications through credit provision, improved extension services

Abstract = {{The nutrient-poor, semi-natural grasslands of the Swiss Alps are amongst
   the most species-rich habitats in Europe. To investigate changes over 25
   years in the diversity and floristic composition of these plant
   communities, we repeated a total of 151 phytosociological releves,
   originally recorded between 1975 and 1985 in Chateau-d'Oex, Grindelwald,
   Tujetsch und Sent. In this second survey, our results showed that the
   grasslands still remained very diverse. On average, we counted 52 to 60
   species per plot (25-100 m(2)) according to region and compared to the
   original survey there was even an increase in three of four regions of
   between 2 and I I species. The plant communities included a high
   proportion of nutrient-poor grassland habitat specialists (NPG-species)
   some of which are protected in Switzerland; this Substantiates their
   particular nature conservation value. However the proportion of these
   species significantly declined over the last 25 years (-4\% to -12\%)
   while species typical of fertile grasslands and ubiquitous species
   increased. The increase in mean nutrient indicator values (+0,07 to
   +0,24 units) indicates that the floristic shifts were most probably due
   to a nutrient accumulation in these habitats. The NPG-species were only
   maintained in unfertilized meadows managed as ecological compensation
   areas (ECA) whereas there was a significant decline in all other types
   of land use (meadows converted to sheep pastures, cattle pastures,
   meadows not managed as ECA and slightly fertilized ECA meadows). To
   maintain the high conservation value of nutrient-poor grasslands in the
   Alps, it is important to support low-intensity management, especially
   mowing, and to prevent further eutrophication.}},

Abstract = {{Meadows require regular harvesting (cutting) to avoid vegetation
   succession, and this is well known to promote high plant diversity. The
   impacts of the harvesting process on animal, and particularly
   invertebrate, abundance and diversity is not, however, well known, but
   is expected to be largely negative. This study reviews the available
   information on the direct mortality caused by the meadow harvesting
   process on vertebrate and invertebrate populations with the intention of
   raising the profile of this neglected area of research which is
   nevertheless important in the context of declining field fauna
   diversity. Collectively, the studies show a direct and often substantial
   impact of the harvesting process on the fauna, especially from the
   mowing stages, and that this impact depends on the techniques and
   equipment used, as well as the settings, the habitat and the ecology of
   each species. The post-mowing harvesting stages also have considerable
   relevance, especially grass removal (baling), which may first
   concentrate organisms in windrows before removing them from the held,
   but have been rarely Studied. Differences among mowing techniques and
   equipment can amount to a threefold change in the scale of impact on
   field fauna, and therefore there is a potential to reduce direct
   harvesting impacts. According to the reviewed studies, the use of cutter
   bar mowers is recommended over rotary and flail mowers, as they cause
   half as much mortality. If a rotary mower is used, then an add-on
   conditioner should be avoided. However, for less mobile species, it is
   still unclear if the benefit gain from friendly mowing techniques might
   be cancelled by subsequent harvesting stages, and this important point
   needs further investigation. Because no practicable harvesting processes
   are damage free, leaving uncut grass strips is a simple and good
   practice that will benefit many organisms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The effects of size, isolation and grazing intensity on spider
   assemblages were studied in the fragments of sandy grasslands (East
   Hungary, Nyirseg). Spiders were sampled by sweep-netting at eight
   different-sized grassland fragments between 2001 and 2003 from April to
   October fortnightly. The following hypotheses were tested: (i) the rules
   of classical island biogeography are assessed for grassland fragments:
   the number of species increases with the size and decreases with the
   isolation of the fragment. (ii) Species richness of spiders decreases by
   the intensity of grazing. (iii) Grazing may have a negative influence on
   the large, web-builder spiders and on the diurnal hunters associated to
   the vegetation. During the 3-year study period, 3842 spider specimens
   belonging to 90 species were collected from the eight sandy grassland
   fragments. We found no significant relationship for the size and
   isolation of grassland fragments neither with the number of species nor
   the number of vegetation-dwelling species, species associated with sandy
   soils, and with the vegetation-dwel ling species specific to sandy area.
   Our result suggests that even the small fragments had a relatively large
   species pool. There was a positive correlation of the average height of
   vegetation as a measure ofgrazing intensity with the total number of
   spider species, as well as with the number of vegetation-dwelling
   species, species associated with sandy soils, and also with the number
   of vegetation-dwelling species specific to sandy area. By indicator
   species analysis (IndVal) we found that the grazing had a negative
   influence on the large, web-builder spiders and also those diurnal
   hunters, which were associated to the vegetation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This study examines the effects of season and of two grazing
   intensities, namely extensive grazing (EG) and intensive grazing (IG),
   oil the grazing behaviour of heifers on species-rich upland pasture in

   continuously stocked in two completely randomized blocks from June to
   late September in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2006 and 2007. Swards were
   maintained at a target height of 5 and 10 cm, respectively. Grazing,
   ruminating, resting, and other activities were monitored during 24 h
   observations, and grazing, chewing and ruminating rates (per minute)
   were recorded. Daily behavioural patterns and the time budgets for
   particular activities were not significantly different between IG and EG
   heifers. However, IG heifers did spend more time grazing and slightly
   less time ruminating and resting than EG heifers. Other activity Such as
   drinking, salt licking, comfort behaviour or social interaction was
   stable and there was no difference between the two treatments. Grazing
   rates were found significantly higher for IG heifers. Grazing was
   negatively affected by increase in air temperature at the expense of
   testing. Grazing time increased as the season progressed in the both IG
   and EG treatments, while resting showed a reverse trend. Concurrently,
   the ruminating time of IG heifers decreased and was variable for EG
   heifers. As the season progressed further, grazing rates then showed a
   decreasing trend. Considering that the differences in behavioural
   patterns between IG and EG were not conspicuous, our results indicate
   that the target sward of 5 cm commonly used in animal husbandry
   practices in the Czech Republic does offer enough forage to animals.
   Furthermore, the seasonal patterns of ingestive behaviour showed that
   the heifers under both grazing intensities balanced their intake by
   increase of grazing time along with decrease of grazing rates as the
   season progressed. These findings suggest that the herbage on
   species-rich pasture was sufficiently available to livestock at both the
   investigated grazing intensities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Riparian forest buffers may play a critical role in moderating the
   impacts of deforestation on tropical stream ecosystems, but very few
   studies have examined the ecological effects of riparian buffers in the
   tropics. To test the hypothesis that riparian forest buffers can reduce
   the impacts of deforestation on tropical stream biota, we sampled fish
   assemblages in lowland headwater streams in southeastern Costa Rica
   representing three different treatments: (1) forested reference stream
   reaches, (2) stream reaches adjacent to pasture with a riparian forest
   buffer averaging at least 15 m in width on each bank, and (3) stream
   reaches adjacent to pasture without a riparian forest buffer. Land cover
   upstream from the study reaches was dominated by forest at all of the
   sites, allowing us to isolate the reach-scale effects of the three study
   treatments. Fish density was significantly higher in pasture reaches
   than in forest and forest buffer reaches, mostly due to an increase in
   herbivore-detritivores, but fish biomass did not differ among reach
   types. Fish species richness was also higher in pasture reaches than in
   forested reference reaches, while forest buffer reaches were
   intermediate. Overall, the taxonomic and trophic structure of fish
   assemblages in forest and forest buffer reaches was very similar, while
   assemblages in pasture reaches were quite distinct. These patterns were
   persistent across three sampling periods during our 15-month study.
   Differences in stream ecosystem conditions between pasture reaches and
   forested sites, including higher stream temperatures, reduced fruit and
   seed inputs, and a trend toward increased periphyton abundance, appeared
   to favor fish species normally found in larger streams and facilitate a
   native invasion process. Forest buffer reaches, in contrast, had stream
   temperatures and allochthonous inputs more similar to forested streams.
   Our results illustrate the importance of riparian areas to stream
   ecosystem integrity in the tropics and provide support for Costa Rican
   legislation protecting riparian forests.}},

Abstract = {{Animals selecting habitats often have to consider many factors, e. g.,
   food and cover for safety. However, each habitat type often lacks an
   adequate mixture of these factors. Analyses of habitat selection using
   resource selection functions (RSFs) for animal radiotelemetry data
   typically ignore trade-offs, and the fact that these may change during
   an animal's daily foraging and resting rhythm on a short-term basis.
   This may lead to changes in the relative use of habitat types if
   availability differs among individual home ranges, called functional
   responses in habitat selection. Here, we identify such functional
   responses and their underlying behavioral mechanisms by estimating RSFs
   through mixed-effects logistic regression of telemetry data on 62 female
   red deer (Cervus elaphus) in Norway. Habitat selection changed with time
   of day and activity, suggesting a trade-off in habitat selection related
   to forage quantity or quality vs. shelter. Red deer frequently used
   pastures offering abundant forage and little canopy cover during
   nighttime when actively foraging, while spending much of their time in
   forested habitats with less forage but more cover during daytime when
   they are more often inactive. Selection for pastures was higher when
   availability was low and decreased with increasing availability.
   Moreover, we show for the. first time that in the real world with forest
   habitats also containing some forage, there was both increasing
   selection of pastures (i.e., not proportional use) and reduced time
   spent in pastures (i.e., not constant time use) with lowered
   availability of pastures within the home range. Our study demonstrates
   that landscape-level habitat composition modifies the trade-off between
   food and cover for large herbivorous mammals. Consequently, landscapes
   are likely to differ in their vulnerability to crop damage and threat to
   biodiversity from grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Four hypotheses were tested using long-term observations of vegetation
   development (12 years) and present-day seed bank data in a sandy
   grassland area overgrazed by domestic geese: i) Gap regeneration is
   crucial in maintaining species richness; thus, closed vegetation of the
   lower sites prevents continuous establishment of short-lived species.
   ii) Short-lived, early successional species comprise most of the seed
   banks and late successional perennials have at most sparse seed banks.
   iii) Composition of seed banks is more similar to pioneer vegetation
   than to later successional stages. iv) The similarity is higher between
   vegetation and seed banks in the upper-positioned plots than in the
   closed, lower-positioned ones. Two sites, located in the upper part of
   dune slopes, and another two, positioned on the lower part, were
   studied. In each site five 2 x 2 m permanent plots were surveyed between
   1991 and 2002. Percentage cover was estimated three times a year. In the
   last study year, soil seed banks were sampled. Two vertical segments
   (0-5, 5-10 cm) were separately analyzed. The seedling emergence method
   was applied on concentrated samples. We found that the vegetation
   developed from open, annual dominated weedy assemblages to grasslands
   dominated by perennial graminoids. In the lower-positioned sites
   perennial clonal grasses (Cynodon dactylon, Poa angustifolia and P.
   pratensis) formed more closed vegetation, which was accompanied by lower
   species richness compared to the upper-positioned sites. Seed density
   varied between 10,300 and 40,900 seeds/m(2). Significantly higher seed
   densities were found in upper sites than in the lower ones. Annuals and
   short-lived perennial dicots comprised most of the seed bank. The
   dominant perennial graminoids also built up dense seed banks. We found a
   low to medium similarity between vegetation and the seed bank;
   similarity was the highest with the vegetation of the 1994-1998 period.
   In the upper sites the similarity between seed bank and the vegetation
   of the last studied years was also high. The vertical position had a
   significant effect on regeneration after overgrazing. The large cover of
   grasses in lower sites decreased species richness and it also decreased
   the seed density preventing the seed bank formation of annuals and
   short-lived perennials. Here, further management practices are needed to
   increase the species richness.}},

   per plot using the `Pollard walk', with grasshoppers being recorded on
   two occasions along the same transects. Diversity patterns of the three

   the Low compared with the High stocking rate. Stress-tolerant grasses

   an opposite trend was observed for competitive grasses. Butterflies
   consistently responded to alterations in vegetation composition,

Abstract = {{Heathlands in the northwest of Spain have been traditionally used by
   domestic herbivores as a food resource. However, their abandonment ill
   the past decades has promoted a high incidence of wildfires, threatening
   biodiversity. Sheep and goats exhibit different grazing behavior,
   affecting rangelands dynamics ill a different way, but the botanical and
   structural composition may also affect such dynamics. The aim of this
   article was to compare the grazing effects of sheep and goats oil three
   different heathland types: previously burned grass- or gorse (Ulex
   gallii Planchon)-dominated and unburned heather (Erica spp.)dominated
   shrublands. Two grazing treatments (sheep or goats) were applied in each
   vegetation type in a factorial design with two replicates (12
   experimental plots). A small fenced area was excluded from grazing in
   each plot (control treatment). The experiment was carried out from 2003
   to 2006, and the grazing season extended from May to October-November.
   Plant cover, canopy height, and phytomass amount and composition were
   assessed in each plot. Results showed that goats controlled shrub
   encroachment, phytomass accumulation, and canopy height more than sheep
   in either burned grass- and gorse- and unburned heather-dominated
   shrublands. It was accompanied by a higher increase of herbaceous
   species under goat grazing. Nevertheless, plant dynamics showed
   different trends between the three vegetation types studied. Grazing
   effects were more important in previously burned grass-dominated
   heathlands than ill unburned heather-dominated shrublands. At the end of
   the experiment (May 2006), shrub cover, height, and woody phytomass were
   significantly higher in the ungrazed enclosures than in the grazed
   plots. Small ruminant grazing, especially with goats, is proposed as ail
   efficient tool to reduce shrub encroachment and woody phytomass
   accumulation in heathlands, thus reducing fire hazard, although these
   grazing effects depend on heathland composition.}},

Abstract = {{Since the dawn of agriculture, people and wild animals have been in
   conflict because agricultural crops generally offer a rich food source
   for wild animals as well as for people. Large, wild herbivores compete
   for pasture resources with livestock and can act as reservoirs of
   livestock diseases. Furthermore, livestock form a concentrated and
   vulnerable food source for predators. As a result, humans have
   extirpated many native animal species from agricultural areas, either
   directly, or indirectly through modifications in habitat availability or
   structure resulting from land use changes. As human populations have
   expanded in developing countries they have caused loss in biodiversity
   and species extinctions, and will continue to do so. I review attempts
   to change the interaction between people and large herbivores from one
   that is primarily negative to one that is positive by increasing the
   benefits which individuals, communities and society derive from wild,
   large herbivores. My proposition is that, in developing Countries, it is
   only by using this approach that wild, large herbivores have a chance of
   surviving Outside areas specifically set aside for their protection. In
   the developed world the opposite trend will occur as people move into
   the cities causing human populations to decline in rural regions. As a
   consequence, wildlife habitat will increase and wild, large herbivores
   will come into conflict with humans, particularly in peri-urban areas
   rather than in rural areas as happens at present. This will lead to a
   change in public attitude from one that Supports wildlife conservation
   to one that sees wild, large herbivores as a threat; again, with
   potential negative consequences for wildlife conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests offer a wide range of
   timber and non-timber values, which may benefit from a balanced timber
   harvest by variable retention systems with conservation of biodiversity.
   A major component of biodiversity are forest floor small mammal
   communities whose abundance and diversity serve as ecological indicators
   of significant change in forest structure and function from harvesting
   activities. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that
   abundance, reproduction, and survival of (i) the southern red-backed
   vole (Myodes gapperi, formerly Clethrionomys gapperi), will decline;
   (ii) the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus), will be similar; and (iii)
   the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and northwestern chipmunk
   (Tamias amoenus), will increase, with decreasing levels of tree
   retention. Small mammal populations were live-trapped from 1994 to 1997
   in replicated sites of uncut forest, 20\% and 50\% volume removal by
   single tree selection, 20\%, 35\%, and 50\% patch cuts based on openings
   of 0.1-1.6 ha, and small 1.6 ha clearcuts in Douglas-fir forest near
   Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada. M. gapperi dominated the small
   mammal community, starting with an abundance of 74-98 animals/ha with
   mean values ranging from 33 to 51 animals/ha. In the two post-harvest
   years, abundance, reproduction, and survival of M. gapperi populations
   were consistently similar among uncut forest and the various levels of
   tree retention. Thereafter, M. gapperi was seldom found on the small
   clearcuts. M. pennsylvanicus, T amoenus, and P. maniculatus occurred
   predominantly in clearcut sites. As with other types of forest
   disturbance, responses to our treatments were species-specific. The most
   striking result was the high abundance and productivity of M. gapperi
   populations in a dry forest ecosystem, a novel result for this
   bio-indicator species of closed-canopy forest conditions. At least with
   respect to small mammals, the retention systems studied seem to enable
   timber extraction and maintenance of mature forest habitat in these dry

Abstract = {{The potential and regeneration capacity of soil seed banks in three
   eastern Ethiopian rangeland ecosystems (Asbuli grassland or arid
   grassland, Aydora open savanna or and bush/grassland and Hurso closed
   savanna or and bush land) were determined over a degradation gradient.
   Soil samples from 0.09 m 2 blocks (100 mm deep) were spread evenly in
   plastic containers in the greenhouse and studied over a 1-year period.
   The aboveground species composition was also compared. Sampling was from
   rangelands in excellent, good, moderate and poor conditions for each
   ecosystem.
   A total of 122 plant species were identified in the soil seed banks,
   with 32\% in the Asbuli grassland, 35\% in the Aydora open savanna and
   33\% in the Hurso closed savanna. Seedlings emerging from soil samples
   were in the order of decreasing number, grasses, forbs, woody plants,
   weeds and legumes. Seedling density decreased (P < 0.05) in the soil
   seed bank with rangeland degradation in all ecosystems. Grass species
   richness was poorer in the degraded Asbuli grassland ecosystems, but
   increased in the Aydora open savanna and Hurso closed savanna. The grass
   species Tragus berteronianus and woody plant Crotolaria albicaulis
   dominated the botanical composition of the seed bank for all ecosystems
   with rangeland degradation. Eragrostis cilianensis and Eriochloa nubica
   were the dominant grass species in the soil seed bank of all ecosystems,
   regardless of rangeland degradation.
   There is no adequate evidence to prove that severe degraded rangelands
   in eastern Ethiopia maintain adequate soil seed banks that would improve
   the condition of it through restoration. Application of efficient
   management systems and long-term conservation planning in future is

   between plant species composition changes and the soil ecology affect
   each other. In many chronosequence studies, the soil microbial community
   tends to shift towards a less bacterial, and more fungal dominated food
   web energy channel following a reduction in fertilizer inputs and
   grazing intensity. Whereas changes in microarthropod communities are
   obscured, nematode trophic functional group (ecological guild) changes
   respond to both plant and soil community changes. There are

Abstract = {{An important aim of conservation biology is to understand how habitat
   change affects the dynamics and extinction risk of populations. We used
   matrix models to analyze the effect of habitat degradation on the
   demography of the declining perennial plant Trifolium montanum in 9
   calcareous grasslands in Germany over 4 years and experimentally tested
   the effect of grassland management. Finite population growth rates
   (lambda) decreased with light competition, measured as leaf-area index
   above T. montanum plants. At unmanaged sites lambda was < 1 due to lower
   recruitment and lower survival and flowering probability of large
   plants. Nevertheless, in stochastic simulations, extinction of unmanaged
   populations of 100 flowering plants was delayed for several decades.
   Clipping as a management technique rapidly increased population growth
   because of higher survival and flowering probability of large plants in
   managed than in unmanaged plots. Transition-matrix simulations from
   these plots indicated grazing or mowing every second year would be
   sufficient to ensure a growth rate >= 1 if conditions stayed the same.
   At frequently grazed sites, the finite growth rate was approximately 1
   in most populations of T. montanum. In stochastic simulations, the
   extinction risk of even relatively small grazed populations was low, but
   about half the extant populations of T. montanum in central Germany are
   smaller than would be sufficient for a probability of survival of > 95\%
   over 100 years. We conclude that habitat change after cessation of
   management strongly reduces recruitment and survival of established
   individuals of this perennial plant. Nevertheless, our results suggest
   extinction processes may take a long time in perennial plants, resulting
   in an extinction debt. Even if management is frequent, many remnant
   populations of T. montanum may be at risk because of their small size,
   but even a slight increase in size could considerably reduce their
   extinction risk.}},

   dense patches in California grasslands. I transplanted L. nanus across
   its own patch boundaries, yet within apparently suitable habitat, and
   assessed the demographic success of naturally occurring and seeded
   plants in plots with and without competitor removal in years that varied
   in temperature and rainfall. Core sites were defined as those

   fitness near replacement in the wet/cool year, which was greatly
   increased by competition removal. Exterior fitness was <1.0 in both
   experimental years, regardless of seed addition and competitor removal.
   Seed addition did not increase site-specific fitness, and a seed bank
   was found to be present in all site types. Herbivory was greater in
   patch cores and peripheries than in exteriors. Soil variation exerted
   the most consistent control over patch limits, while competition played
   an intermittent role in excluding Lupinus from patch peripheries. The
   dynamic distribution of L. nanus is the product of temporal variation in
   specific abiotic and biotic niche axes, primarily soil characteristics
   and competition, rather than dispersal limitation.}},

Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{Vast areas of arable land have been retired from crop production and
   ``rehabilitated'' to improved system states through landowner incentive
   programs in the United States (e. g., Conservation and Wetland Reserve
   Programs), as well as Europe (i.e., Agri-Environment Schemes). Our
   review of studies conducted on invasion of rehabilitated agricultural
   production systems by nontarget species elucidates several factors that
   may increase the vulnerability of these systems to invasion. These
   systems often exist in highly fragmented and agriculturally dominated
   landscapes, where propagule sources of target species for colonization
   may be limited, and are established under conditions where legacies of
   past disturbance persist and prevent target species from persisting.
   Furthermore, rehabilitation approaches often do not include or
   successfully attain all target species or historical ecological
   processes (e. g., hydrology, grazing, and/or fire cycles) key to
   resisting invasion. Uncertainty surrounds ways in which nontarget
   species may compromise long term goals of improving biodiversity and
   ecosystem services through rehabilitation efforts on former agricultural
   production lands. This review demonstrates that more studies are needed
   on the extent and ecological impacts of nontarget species as related to
   the goals of rehabilitation efforts to secure current and future
   environmental benefits arising from this widespread conservation
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural improvement (fertilisation, liming, intensification of
   grazing) of acidic upland pastures results in loss of indigenous flora
   and notable changes in microbial community structure. Such practices
   have recently raised concerns regarding the possible impacts on natural
   ecosystem biodiversity and functioning. The effects of synthetic sheep
   urine (SSU) and plant species on fungal community structure in upland
   grassland microcosms were investigated. Plant species typical of
   agriculturally unimproved (Agrostis capillaris) and improved (Lolium
   perenne) pastures were treated with low, medium or high concentrations
   of SSU, with harvests carried out 10 d and 50 d after SSU application.
   Root biomass was negatively affected by SSU addition whereas shoot
   biomass did not display any significant change. Fungal richness (number
   of operational taxonomic units) was negatively correlated with SSU
   concentration ( p < 0.001), and also with time ( p < 0.001).
   Multi-dimensional scaling plots revealed significant changes in fungal
   community composition, depending on concentration of SSU and plant
   species type, while canonical correspondence analysis also emphasised
   the importance of interacting environmental variables. in addition,
   SIMPER analyses supported the finding that shifts in fungal community
   composition under different SSU and plant treatments had occurred.
   Overall, while SSU appeared to be influential in deter-mining fungal
   community structure, community changes were largely driven by
   interacting environmental factors. This study contributes to our
   understanding of the potential implications of intensified fanning, in
   particular increased pressure from grazing animals, on fungal community
   structure in semi-natural grassland systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{Land-use change is the main component of regional environmental change,
   while protected areas represent a direct land use policy to prevent its
   potentially negative effects on biodiversity and environmental services.
   We combined an analysis of trends in land use and human demography with
   trends in creation of protected areas during the last three decades in
   northwestern Argentina, a subtropical region including a wide range of
   environments. The eighty nine administrative analysis units of the
   region were classified into four ecological groups based on their
   percentage of cover by the six eco-regions of the study area: (1) ``Dry
   valleys{''}: dominated by Middle-elevation deserts; (2) ``Highlands{''},
   dominated by High-elevation alpine zones and plateaus: (3) ``Humid
   ecosystems{''}, dominated by Foggy grasslands and Humid forests, and (4)
   ``Dry forests{''}. Between 1970 and 2002, human population became
   concentrated in urban areas and land use trends varied greatly among the
   four ecological groups. Agricultural area decreased in the Highlands and
   increased in the other regions, particularly in the Dry forests.
   Domestic animals decreased in Humid ecosystems, Highlands and the Dry
   valleys: and remained constant in the Dry forests. Several protected
   areas were created, but most of them were established in regions
   undergoing a decreasing intensity of land use. Overall, the analysis
   shows that agricultural production is becoming concentrated in the areas
   more suitable for modern agriculture while marginal agriculture areas
   and, particularly, extensive grazing are decreasing. The creation of
   protected areas reflects the decreasing opportunity costs of marginal
   areas and is failing to protect the eco-regions most threatened by
   current land-use trends. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Do above- and belowground insects differentially impact plant community

   Rough fescue prairie in Alberta, Canada.
   Above- and belowground insects were suppressed with insecticides for 5
   years using a randomised block design. During this experiment, a severe
   drought began in 2001 and ended in 2003. Aboveground plant growth was
   measured as cover and biomass from 2001 to 2005. Root demography was
   measured in 2002 using a minirhizotron. Mixed models and repeated
   measures ANOVA were used to determine treatment effects on a number of
   response variables. MRBP were used to test for treatment effects on
   community composition.
   Five years of insect suppression had few significant effects on plant
   growth, species richness or community composition, and were limited
   primarily to the severe drought in 2002. During the drought, insect
   attack increased root mortality, reduced plant cover, and altered
   community composition. Following the drought, plant responses were
   unaffected by insecticide application for the remainder of the
   experiment.
   Five years of insect suppression had only minor effects on community
   structure and function in this diverse native grassland. There was no
   indication that these effects increased over time. The results are
   counter to studies conducted in productive old-field communities that
   revealed large effects of insects on community structure. We suggest
   that the unique features of this system, such as high species evenness,
   abundance of generalist herbivores, and a lack of competition for light
   among plants, limited the potential for insects to greatly impact
   community-level processes.}},

Abstract = {{In an increasingly human-dominated landscape, effective management of
   disturbance-maintained ecosystems, such as grasslands and savannas, is
   critical to the conservation of biodiversity. Yet, the response of
   individual organisms to landscapes created by disturbances and
   management is rarely studied. In this study, we examined the endangered
   Karner blue butterfly, Lycaeides melissa samuelis, in a heterogeneous
   oak savanna. Our objective was to quantify the butterfly's habitat use
   and behavior to assess the effects of prescribed burning. The oak
   savanna management in Ohio, USA divides each Karner blue site (n = 4)
   into three units. Each one-third unit is then burned, mowed, or
   unmanaged in an annual rotation within each site, and the result is a
   fire return interval of similar to 3 years. Our surveys measured habitat
   use, while behavior observations quantified reproduction and foraging
   for the two annual broods. Our habitat use results showed burned
   treatments were recolonized quickly, but there was not a clear selection
   for burned treatments. Foraging rates were similar in all treatments;
   however, females oviposited significantly less in unmanaged treatments
   (only 5 of 127 ovipositions). This oviposition preference was likely due
   to habitat degradation and the availability of recently burned, early
   successional habitat. Since Karner blues avoided reproduction in units
   unburned for a parts per thousand yen4 years, these units could be
   burned to create high quality early successional habitat. These results
   demonstrate how behavioral decisions can be pivotal forces driving
   spatial population dynamics. Our case study demonstrates how a
   fine-scale landscape perspective combined with measurements of
   behavioral processes can assist with management decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Coastal sand dunes are considered to be threatened by the atmospheric
   deposition of nitrogen (N); however, experimental investigations of the
   effects of N deposition on dune vegetation and soil using realistic N
   loads and sites with low background deposition are scarce. This study
   reports the effects of low levels of fertilisation with N and phosphorus
   (P) on the vegetation, above-ground biomass, plant tissue chemistry and
   soil chemistry of fixed dune grasslands. in addition, the impacts of
   grazing management and its potential to mitigate adverse effects of N
   fertilisation were examined. Four N treatments (unwatered control,
   watered control, + 7.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1), + 15 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) were
   combined with three grazing treatments (ungrazed, rabbit grazed, rabbit
   and pony grazed). In a separate experiment, effects of fertilisation
   with both N (15 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) and P (20 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) were
   investigated. Vegetation composition was assessed using the point
   quadrat method. Above-ground biomass, sward heights, tissue N and P
   concentrations and soil chemical parameters were also measured. After
   two years, N addition resulted in greater amounts of total above-ground
   biomass, bryophyte biomass and changes in bryophyte tissue chemistry. No
   effects on vegetation composition, sward height or soil parameters
   occurred. Fertilisation with both nutrients had a greater impact on
   above-ground biomass, sward heights and sward structure than N addition
   alone. The grazing treatments differed in their species composition. The
   changes observed after only two years of fertilisation may lead to
   community changes over longer time scales. Effects were observed even
   under heavy grazing with phosphorus limitation. Therefore, the upper
   critical load for N for dune grasslands may be below the previously
   proposed 20 kg ha(-1) year(-1) and grazing may not mitigate all negative
   effects of N deposition. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{When livestock are turned out to semi-natural grasslands, an effective

   resulting diminished live weight loss, when experienced cattle
   accompanied them acting as social models. Twenty-six first-season
   grazing (FSG) dairy calves, allocated to groups with or without company

   grazing-experienced steers had similar grazing times (on average 42.7\%
   of the day) to calves turned out to pasture in groups without older
   steers, but they had higher grazing activity during the first day on

Abstract = {{Quercus pyrenaica dehesas have been traditionally used as communal
   extensive grazing systems in the Leon province (NW Spain). In this
   region, recent abandonment of rural areas and the subsequent gradual
   decrease in livestock load have led to the invasion of shrubs in the
   understory, increasing the risk of fires. Indeed, even if there is no
   need of creating new pasturelands for livestock breeding, the remaining
   landowners keep on burning to clear these montane patches.
   Alternatively, the regional administration encourages shrub cutting as a
   better way of managing these areas and preserving the pasturelands. Our
   aim was to determine the effects of the dehesa abandonment and shrub
   cutting on plant species richness (annual herbs, perennial herbs and
   woody plants) and species composition, as well as on topsoil properties.
   For that, we compared three types of dehesas with different management
   regimes: (1) grazed dehesas (used at the present), (2) abandoned dehesas
   (more than 20 years without grazing) and (3) dehesas where shrub cutting
   was applied after abandonment (i.e. cleared dehesas). We selected three
   replicates or stands per dehesa type. The highest organic matter content
   (O.M.), total nitrogen (N) and available phosphorus (P) were found in
   cleared dehesas, while the lowest values corresponded to the grazed
   ones. Abandoned dehesas were characterized by the highest values for
   available calcium (Ca(2+)). No significant differences were detected
   regarding the vegetation richness values (S alpha, gamma or beta),
   although higher mean values of S alpha and gamma were found in grazed
   dehesas and lower, values in the cleared ones. Concerning the vegetation
   life forms, grazed dehesas held significantly greater species richness
   and cover of annual herbs, while abandoned dehesas had significantly
   higher woody species cover. Both grazed and abandoned dehesas harboured
   plant species (38 and 13 species, respectively), which were exclusively
   found in one dehesa type. Contrary to that, cleared dehesas scarcely had
   exclusive species. To conclude, our results indicated that shrub cutting
   alone (not followed by livestock grazing) may cause loss of plant
   species richness, suggesting that it is not the most appropriate
   management method to restore vegetation, except for reducing the risk of
   fire. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most pathogens exist within complicated food webs of interacting hosts,
   vectors, competitors, and predators. Although theory has demonstrated a
   variety of mechanisms by which predation and competition in food webs
   can indirectly control infection risk in hosts, there have until now
   been no experimental tests of this theory. We sampled the effect of
   long-term exclusion of large vertebrate herbivores on the prevalence of
   infection by a group of aphid-vectored viruses that infect grasses
   (barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses) in an oak savannah in central
   California. We found that pathogen prevalence was similar to 4-fold
   higher in the presence of consumers than in areas where they were
   excluded. Vertebrate consumers did not directly alter infection rates by
   this aphid-vectored pathogen group, but rather increased infection risk
   by increasing the relative abundance of highly-competent hosts in the
   grassland community. This large-scale experiment, measuring changes in
   host abundance and infection risk in response to altered consumption
   rates, confirms theoretical predictions that consumers can indirectly
   increase infection risk by altering the composition of whole
   communities. Most importantly, these results demonstrate that, even in
   complex natural communities, alterations to food web composition such as
   consumer invasion or extinction can lead to significant impacts that
   cascade throughout entire communities, including changes in infection

Abstract = {{The visible tendency of Swiss farms to specialise and grow in size has
   not been without consequences for agriculture. Working time is an
   increasingly scarce commodity, whilst the incentive to farm low-yield,
   labour intensive land is decreasing. This has consequences for
   landscape: the forest is reclaiming land that farmers have given up
   working, biodiversity is dwindling, and the mosaic-like cultural
   landscape is changing. How can we, for example, keep the grassland open
   in the mountain area in a cost-effective manner? Agroscope
   Reckenholz-Tanikon Research Station ART compared various methods, using
   full accounting.
   With uncovered costs of CHF 161 to CHF 435 per hectare for all slope
   angles and plot sizes, mulching fared the best. On steep slopes or small
   plots, grazing young cattle, sheep or goats is economically more
   advantageous than mowing for dry-forage production (CHF 713 to CHF
   1162). Clearly the most expensive process is haymaking for thermal use
   (burning), which costs from CHF 1115 to CHF 2091. If a farm is able to
   use the eco-hay internally, disposing of the latter by burning is
   neither financially nor ecologically worthwhile. Mowing, mulching and
   grazing support species composition and ecosystems in different ways.
   For this reason, the simultaneous use of the methods on different land
   is proving the most advantageous for the mosaic-like cutural landscape,

Abstract = {{As natural woodlands decline in both extent and quality worldwide, there
   is an increasing recognition of the biodiversity conservation value of
   production landscapes. In low-input, low-productivity grazing systems in
   Australia, the modification of natural woodlands through overstorey tree
   and woody regrowth removal are vegetation management options used by
   landholders to increase native grass production for livestock grazing;
   however, there is little empirical evidence to indicate at what tree
   densities biodiversity attributes are compromised. We examined the
   effects of overstorey tree density and understorey regowth on the
   floristic composition, stand structure and species richness of eucalypt
   woodlands in a grazing landscape in the Traprock region of southern
   Queensland, Australia. We sampled 47 sites stratified according to
   vegetation type (Eucalyptus crebra/Eucatyptus dealbata woodland;
   Eucalyptus melliodora/Eucalyptus microcarpa grassy woodland), density of
   mature trees (< 6 trees/ha; 6-20 trees/ha; > 20 trees/ha), and
   presence/absence of regrowth. Distinct patterns in composition were
   detected using indicator species analysis and non-metric
   multidimensional scaling, with low density areas compositionally
   indistinguishable, although distinct from other land management units.
   Within vegetation type, medium tree density woodlands were
   compositionally similar to high density and reference woodlands. Species
   richness ranged from 18 to 67 species per 500 m(2) across all sites. No
   differences in total or native species richness were detected across
   management units: however, some differences in exotic species richness
   were detected. Differences in grass cover existed between low and high
   density management units, yet no difference in grass cover was evident
   between low and medium density management units. Our results suggest
   that medium tree densities may provide biodiversity benefits concordant
   with more natural areas, yet not adversely impact on pasture production.
   Retaining trees in grazing landscapes provides significant landscape
   heterogeneity and important refuges for species that may be largely
   excluded from open grassland habitats. Maintaining a medium density of
   overstorey trees in grazed paddocks can provide both production and
   biodiversity benefits. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Biodiversity benefits of alley farming with old man saltbush in central
   western New South Wales}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{9-10}},
Pages = {{860-868}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural production systems that also provide opportunities to
   conserve biodiversity will be a crucial component of integrated and
   sustainable land use in mixed farming landscapes and should be
   considered and evaluated. Alley farming is an innovative farming system
   that aims to increase farm profitability while also enhancing
   environmental outcomes. Alley farming incorporates belts of woody
   perennial plants such as trees or shrubs, interspersed with alleys of
   conventionally rotated cropping and livestock grazing land. In the
   present study, we assessed the impacts on terrestrial biodiversity of
   alley farming with the native perennial chenopod shrub old man saltbush
   (Atriplex nummularia Lindl.) in central western New South Wales.
   Terrestrial biodiversity conservation status was assessed by site
   surveys conducted in spring 2005, 2006 and 2007 at 15 old man salt bush
   alley farming sites (OMSB), 15 conventionally managed sites and three
   native woodland remnants in and around the Condobolin Agricultural
   Research and Advisory Station in the central western plains of New South
   Wales. Biodiversity surveys included an assessment of `site condition' -
   a metric of biodiversity conservation status at the site scale based on
   measurement of 10 habitat and vegetation condition attributes, compared
   against benchmark values for the appropriate native ecosystems with
   relatively little recent anthropogenic modi. cation. Bird surveys were
   also conducted to assess the diversity and abundance of birds in OMSB,
   conventional and remnant woodland sites in four functional response
   groups. Site condition was significantly higher at remnant woodland
   sites than at conventional farming and OMSB alley farming sites. Remnant
   woodland sites had greater native overstorey cover and native ground
   cover of forbs, more trees with hollows, presence of at least some
   overstorey regeneration and the presence of fallen logs. Site condition
   was also significantly higher at OMSB sites than at conventional sites
   and increased significantly across 3 years. By the third year after
   establishment, OMSB sites had higher native plant species richness and
   native mid-storey cover than did conventionally farmed sites. These
   attributes increased markedly over time at the OMSB sites whereas they
   did not increase at conventional or remnant woodland sites. Native
   grasses and forbs established under and around the saltbush plants,
   indicating that OMSB alley plantings can provide habitat for a wide
   range of native plant species, enhancing biodiversity values of these
   areas through improved structure and composition. Improved habitat
   condition at the OMSB sites after 3 years did not lead to a
   significantly higher diversity or to a higher overall abundance of birds
   at the OMSB than at conventional sites. Furthermore, diversity and
   abundance of birds at both OMSB and conventional sites remained
   significantly below those of remnant woodland sites. Some decliner bird
   species were observed using OMSB sites, but not conventional sites. Old
   man saltbush alley farming can provide direct on-site benefits for
   native biodiversity by improving the structure, function and composition
   of vegetation at the site or paddock scale. If proposed as a replacement
   to conventional crop-pasture rotation, OMSB alley farming can enhance
   biodiversity conservation values, and where production benefits are
   likely, could play an important role in the integration of production
   and conservation as a synergistic `win-win' system in mixed farming
   enterprises.}},

Journal = {{ANIMAL PRODUCTION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{9-10}},
Pages = {{966-974}},
Abstract = {{The continued evolution of mixed farming systems will depend on the
   development of technology which addresses the basic biophysical
   constraints of the agro ecological zone within which these systems have
   developed. However, the application of these technologies will
   increasingly depend on the extent to which they address all dimensions
   of the social-economic-environmental system within which mixed farmers
   operate. The Grain \& Graze program has accelerated the adoption of
   several technologies that can provide a basis for continuing evolution
   of mixed farming systems (e. g. grazing of cereals, drought containment
   of livestock, perennial pastures) while initiating the development and
   exploration of others whose potential will be realised in the longer
   term (e. g. pasture cropping, integrated pest management in mixed
   farming systems, cover cropping and alley farming with old man
   saltbush). Some technologies capable of supporting continued evolution
   were not addressed comprehensively by the program but remain
   opportunities for future development, particularly technologies for feed
   demand management and inter-seasonal feed transfer. The program made
   considerable progress in fostering the explicit consideration of the
   `triple bottom line' consequences of new technology. It has confirmed
   that no universal solution to the question of profitability and
   sustainability is to be expected but has also demonstrated that
   methodology is available to make the formal consideration of this
   question much more robust. Clearer definition of the institutional
   requirements for support of change in complex systems, and for effective
   management of large national projects, will provide key underpinnings to
   ensure that subsequent programs achieve the benefits of scale in RD\&E
   that Grain \& Graze has convincingly demonstrated. In addition, we argue
   that ongoing evolution of mixed farming systems that will deliver triple
   bottom line outcomes will require policies that achieve appropriate cost
   sharing for delivery of environmental benefits and increased capacity
   for structural adjustment within the industry itself, to account for
   changes in demography, infrastructure and farm management arrangements.}},

Abstract = {{Most scrub-shrub bird species are declining in the northeastern United
   States, and these declines are largely attributed to regional declines
   in habitat availability. American Beaver (Castor canadensis; hereafter
   ``beaver{''}) populations have been increasing in the Northeast in
   recent decades, and beavers create scrub-shrub habitat through their
   dam-building and foraging activities. Few systematic studies have been
   conducted on the value of beaver-modified habitats for scrub-shrub
   birds, and these data are important for understanding habitat selection
   of scrub-shrub birds as well as for assessing regional habitat
   availability for these species. We conducted surveys in 37 beaver
   meadows in a 2,800-km(2) study area in western Massachusetts during 2005
   and 2006 to determine the extent to which these beaver-modified habitats
   are used by scrub-shrub birds, as well as the characteristics of beaver
   meadows most closely related to bird use. We modeled bird abundance in
   relation to microhabitat-, patch-, and landscape-context variables while
   adjusting for survey-specific covariates affecting detectability using
   N-mixture models. We found that scrub-shrub birds of regional
   conservation concern occupied these sites and that birds responded
   differently to microhabitat, patch, and landscape characteristics of
   beaver meadows. Generally, scrub-shrub birds increased in abundance
   along a gradient of increasing vegetation complexity, and three species
   were positively related to patch size. We conclude that these habitats
   can potentially play an important role in regional conservation of
   scrub-shrub birds and recommend that conservation priority be given to
   larger beaver meadows with diverse vegetation structure and composition.

Abstract = {{Our study examines the effects of grazing exclusion on low-productive
   subalpine and alpine grasslands of the Central Alps (UNESCO Biosphere
   Park Gurgler Kamm, Obergurgl, Austria). A long-term exclusion experiment
   was established in 2000 in the subalpine, the lower, and the upper
   alpine zone. With exception of the subalpine zone, domestic herbivores
   have been grazing during the whole growing season. In grazed and
   exclosure plots species frequencies were recorded for 7 years. We
   analysed exclosure effects on species number, community composition,
   life forms, and functional groups.
   Species richness did not decrease significantly within the exclosures,
   but changes in species composition occurred in each zone, although some
   were transitory in nature. The dynamic trends of the plots were
   significantly explained by the `treatment x year' effect along the whole
   altitudinal gradient, but the effects decreased considerably with
   altitude. In the subalpine and upper alpine exclosures,
   stress-tolerators, species or low or no nutritive value, and mosses
   showed a decreasing trend, whereas tall grasses (subalpine exclosures),
   competitors, and species with high or medium nutritive values (lower
   alpine exclosures) tended to increase.
   Overall, our 7-year study revealed that. several functional groups
   reacted to grazing, according to Our main expectations. We suggest that
   these effects will intensify in the long term. (C) 2008 Gesellschaft fur

Pages = {{631-639}},
Abstract = {{Shrub encroachment in pastoral areas subsequent to land-Use changes has
   become a major problem for biodiversity and pastoral resource
   conservation. Controlling encroachment by grazing is the most promising
   prospect at this time, but the impact of small domestic ruminants on the
   population dynamics of dominant shrubby species is still poorly
   understood. To control the rapid densification of dominant shrub
   populations means that we have to focus on the early stages of shrub
   colonisation. In this paper, we present a modelling approach that
   includes deterministic matrix modelling to understand demography
   strategy at the very beginning of shrub Population growth and to
   identify potential targeted life stages for control. We collected
   demographic data over a period of 5 years on the European dominant
   shrub, Cytisus scoparius (Scotch broom; Fabaceae), which is often part
   of the heathlands that establish themselves on former permanent
   grasslands in Europe. Our results reveal a very high variation in
   flowering frequency between years and a large contribution of the seed
   bank to the total number of seedlings that emerge each),car. Modelling
   shows that population growth is very vigorous and is not stopped by
   repeated ``bad years{''} for seed production. Sensitivity analyses
   indicate that early life stage survival (seedling, juvenile) has the
   greatest impact on population growth. These results make it possible to
   identify juveniles as one of the best targets for control since they
   combine a high degree of sensitivity in terms of population demography,
   good palatability for domestic herbivores and easy accessibility within
   a management schedule. (c) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{687-696}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the interplay between land-use change, species diversity
   and ecosystem function is critical for the prediction of global change
   impacts on ecosystem services. Biodiversity experiments with artificial
   species assemblages have shown that community-scale species richness may
   affect ecosystem productivity and spatial stability. However, the use of
   synthetic communities with controlled levels of species density for
   biodiversity experiments has been criticised and their relevance for
   natural communities has been questioned. Here, we use a land-use change
   experiment to investigate the biodiversity effects on production within
   managed, upland grasslands. We examine species diversity and
   productivity at both the small plant-neighbourhood scale (14 x 14 cm)
   and the field scale (15 m x 25 m) for two land-use trajectories under
   field conditions: intensification through fertilisation, and
   extensification through the cessation of mowing. Both intensification
   and extensification were associated with a decrease in species number,
   but the magnitude of this decrease was greater at the small scale.
   Extensification was associated with a decrease in small-scale
   productivity whereas intensification had no significant effect on
   small-scale productivity. Effects of land-use treatments on biomass
   production were mediated by variation in small-scale species number;
   species number showed a significant positive relationship with
   small-scale productivity within each land-use treatment. Furthermore,
   species number was associated with a decrease in the variance of
   small-scale green biomass. In contrast, no species diversity effects
   were found on productivity at the field scale. Instead, field-scale
   species diversity decreased with increase in the total above-ground
   biomass (green biomass + litter). This study demonstrates that
   biodiversity effects can be observed under field conditions at the small
   scale and may play an important role for ecosystem functioning and
   stability even in low-diversity plant communities. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft

Abstract = {{Modern grassland management seeks to provide many ecosystem services and
   experimental studies in resource-poor grasslands have shown a positive
   relationship between plant species richness and a variety of ecosystem
   functions. Thus, increasing species richness might help to enhance multi
   functionality in managed grasslands if the relationship between species
   richness and ecosystem functioning is equally valid in high-input
   grassland systems.
   We tested the relative effects of low-input to high-input management
   intensities and low to high plant species richness. Using a combination
   of mowing frequencies (1, 2 or 4 cuts per season) and fertilisation
   levels (0, 100 and 200 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)), we studied the productivity
   of 78 experimental grassland communities of increasing plant species
   richness (1, 2, 4, 8 or 16 species with 1 to 4 functional groups) in two
   successive years.
   Our results showed that in both years higher diversity was more
   effective in increasing productivity than higher management intensity:
   the 16-species mixtures had a surplus of 449 g m(-2) y(-1) in 2006 and
   492 g m(-2) y(-1) in 2007 over the monoculture yields whereas the
   high-input management resulted in only 315 g m(-2) y(-1) higher
   productivity in 2006 and 440 g m(-2) y(-1) in 2007 than the low-input
   management. In addition, high-diversity low-input grassland communities
   had similar productivity as low-diversity high-input communities. The
   slopes of the biodiversity - productivity relationships significantly
   increased with increasing levels of management intensity in both years.
   We conclude that the biological mechanisms leading to enhanced biomass
   production in diverse grassland communities are as effective for
   productivity as a combination of several agricultural measures. Our
   results demonstrate that high-diversity low-input grassland communities
   provide not only a high diversity of plants and other organisms, but
   also ensure high forage yields, thus granting the basis for
   multifunctional managed grasslands.}},

   dwarf mistletoe (Arceuthobium spp.) infection results in major
   commercial losses and poses a public liability in recreation settings.
   Hyperparasitic fungi have potential as biological control agents of
   dwarf mistletoe, including species which attack shoots, berries, and the
   endophytic systems of dwarf mistletoe. Development of an inundative
   biological control strategy will be useful in situations where
   traditional silvicultural control is impractical or undesirable. In
   southern Australia. farm eucalypts are often attacked and killed by
   mistletoes (Amyema spp.) in grazed landscapes where tree decline and
   biodiversity loss are major forms of land degradation. Although
   long-term strategies to achieve a balance between mistletoe and host

Abstract = {{Grasslands and forage crops are a main component of the French
   agricultural area. They provide herbivore herds feed, thus contributing
   to a major economic sector. Analysis of environmental functions shows
   that grasslands significantly reduce soil erosion and limit nitrogen
   loss under adequate management. They may also reduce fossil energy
   consumption through reduction of nitrogen fertilizers and of feed
   concentrates. They may preserve flora and fauna biodiversity thanks to
   their own plant diversity, their life duration and their contribution to
   the landscape mosaic. It may be concluded that grasslands are not
   multi-functional per se. In order to combine production and environment
   preservation objectives, tools at paddock scale include use of swards
   with complex flora with a significant contribution of legumes and
   management practices that will facilitate sward persistence. Share of
   acreage dedicated to grazing or to production of feed stocks, geographic
   location of the various crops on the farms and hedgerows will be key
   tools for economic systems which will be viable, secure and flexible,
   while remaining relevant with a preserved environment. Animal objectives
   will also be important. At a territorial scale, interaction between
   animal and grain-producing farms must be reassessed. However, an
   uncertainty is raised concerning the possibility of re-shaping
   territories already fully specialised in either animal or grain
   production. Farmers play a major role in achieving this economic and

Abstract = {{Mountain butterfly species are often restricted in their distribution

   requirements of the Alpine endemic species Erebia calcaria could be used
   for modelling its potential distribution. We surveyed part of its range
   using transects and recorded habitat and environmental parameters. The
   most important parameters determining the presence of the species were
   average height of the vegetation, maximum height of the vegetation,
   percentage area of bare ground, number of food plants and slope.
   Furthermore, the abundance of E. calcaria is strongly affected by site
   exposure and grazing intensity. Using these results we modelled the
   potential distribution of the species in its known historical range in
   Slovenia. In the region covered by the model 70\% of the records of E.
   calcaria were within the predicted distribution. It is reasonable to
   propose that such a high detection rate justifies the use of
   distribution models for predicting a species range and providing
   important additional information for their conservation. In the case of
   E. calcaria, we have shown that endemic mountain butterflies can be
   strongly threatened by fragmentation of their habitat, overgrazing and

Abstract = {{In West Africa, policies for prescribed early fire, grazing and
   selective tree cutting in the savanna-woodlands are rarely based on
   long-term experimental studies. The purpose of this study was to provide
   scientific evidence based on field data from two case studies for an
   informed discussion on the long-term response of herbaceous abundance
   both at the community and individual species levels to fire, grazing,
   selective cutting and their interactions. A long-term factorial
   experiment was established in two State forest reserves in Burkina Faso
   that mainly differ in their soil attributes. Community abundance data
   recorded from line intercept sampling over 13 years were analyzed using
   a multivariate ordination technique known as principal response curves
   (PRC).
   The results indicate that disturbance regimes, independently or
   interactively, influenced species abundance over time with inter-site
   specificity. The dynamics of these disturbance regimes exhibited
   temporal variation which could be related, to some extent, to
   inter-annual variation in annual rainfall. The PRC ordination accounted
   for 38\% and 34\% of the variation within the data set for sites with
   deep and shallow soils, respectively. At the site with deep soils, more
   than one PRC axis was needed to summarize the community response
   sufficiently, suggesting that the species reacted in different ways to
   disturbances. The PRC method approach to the analysis of disturbance
   dynamics allowed us to distil the complexity of the community responses
   to those of individual species and to identify species that can serve as
   indicators of certain disturbance regimes. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Overgrazing often lowers species richness and productivity of grassland
   communities. For Mongolian grassland ecosystems, a lack of detailed
   information about food-web structures makes it difficult to predict the
   effects of overgrazing on species diversity and community composition.
   We analysed the delta C-13 and delta N-15 signatures of herbaceous
   plants, arthropods (grouped by feeding habit), wild and domestic
   mammals, and humans in central Mongolia to understand the predominant
   food-web pathways in this grassland ecosystem. The delta C-13 and delta
   N-15 values of mammals showed little variation within species, but
   varied considerably with slope position for arthropods. The apparent
   isotopic discrimination between body tissue and hair of mammals was
   estimated as 2.0 parts per thousand for delta C-13 and 2.1 parts per
   thousand for delta N-15, which was large enough to cause overestimation
   of the trophic level of mammals if not taken into account when using
   hair samples to measure isotopic enrichment.}},

Abstract = {{Seed size has been considered a key factor influencing the dynamics of
   plant communities, but few empirical, within-community predictions have
   been made based on seed size. Data on species density, biomass,
   frequency, and seed size were measured in alpine meadows with different
   grazing gradients in Northwest China. Seed mass variance and range
   within community were analyzed and relationships between seed size and
   density, biomass, and frequency within community were evaluated. Our
   results showed that vegetation height, coverage, and productivity
   decreased significantly with increasing grazing intensity. Species
   richness and total individual density were greatest in moderately-grazed
   meadow. Mean seed mass, mean coefficient of variation of seed mass, and
   seed mass range within community showed a consistent trend of
   moderately-grazed meadow > ungrazed meadow > heavily-grazed meadow.
   Correlation analyses showed that seed size was positively related to
   species density, biomass, and frequency within community in ungrazed
   meadow, but was negatively related to species density, biomass, and
   frequency within community in heavily-grazed meadow. Our study suggests
   that grazing disturbance can alter the relationship between seed size
   and dominance for coexistent species within communities. With increasing
   grazing intensity, the advantages of species density, biomass, and

Abstract = {{The fragmentation of natural habitats is generally considered to be a
   major threat to biodiversity. Different species may respond differently
   to habitat fragmentation, depending on species-specific traits such as
   body size, dispersal ability, mating system, and habitat requirement.
   The population sizes, extinction and recolonization frequencies of six
   naturally occurring land snail species (Cochlicopa lubrica, Vertigo
   pygmaea, Pupilla muscorum, Punctum pygmaeum, Helicella itala, and
   Trichia plebeia) were examined over 3 years in an experimentally
   fragmented nutrient-poor, calcareous grassland in the northern Swiss
   Jura mountains using a mark-recapture technique. Fragments of different
   size (0.25 m(2), 2.25 m(2), and 20.25 m(2)) were isolated by a 5-m wide
   strip of frequently mown vegetation. Control plots of corresponding size
   were situated in adjacent undisturbed grassland.
   Experimental grassland fragmentation influenced the population size in
   all snail species except H. itala, which is the species with the biggest
   shell and it is also active under mild conditions in winter. However,
   fragmentation affected different species to a different extent.
   Extinction (= disappearance from a plot) frequency increased with time,
   decreasing population size and decreasing plot size in all species.
   Large populations had a lower extinction probability than small
   populations. Fragmentation increased the probability of extinction,
   which also differed among snail species. The effect of plot size on
   extinction probability was still significant even after the effect of
   population size had been taken into account.
   Fragments and control plots did not differ in recolonization frequencies
   when all six species were considered. However, fragmentation influenced
   recolonization frequency when the two species with large shells (H.
   itala and T. plebeia) were excluded from the analysis.
   Our study shows that small-scale grassland fragmentation affects
   different land snail species to a different extent. This finding
   strengthens the claim for multi-species approaches to obtain general
   predictions of fragmentation impact.}},

   Biological diversity produced oil a pasture is estimated by combining a

Year = {{2009}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{The Hieracium flora of westernmost Dalarna, comprising the southern
   fringe of the Scandes alps (central Scandinavia), is extremely rich in
   species. The area is dominated by species-poor coniferous sub-alpine and
   taiga forest, but within this matrix there are small and isolated sites
   with high species richness of both Hieracium and other plants. Both
   steep mountain slopes with outcrops of base-rich bedrock and moving
   ground water, and old seasonal or permanant human settlements constitute
   such biodiversity hotspots. However, today the former are threatened by
   modern forestry practices and/or exploitation for winter tourism and the
   latter are commonly abandoned and subjected to severe overgrowth or
   dramatically changed land-use. The area was thorougly surveyed in
   1897-1921. In 2007, the same region and partly the same sites, were
   revisited. In 1897-1921, 15 Hieracium species were on average recorded
   from each site, but when the same sites were revisited in 2007
   significantly fewer, only about 6 (40\%) species per site, were refound.
   As far as the total species pool of the study area is concerned, it
   consisted of 168 species in 1897-1921, whereof only 117 (67\%) were
   found in 2007. This remarkable reduction in species richness at both the
   local and the regional scale is attributable to both modern forestry
   practices and to the cessation of traditional agricultural practices
   like hay-making on semi-natural grasslands and extensive cattle-grazing
   in the forests. It is concluded that to reduce the on-going severe loss
   of biodiversity in the sub-alpine and taiga regions, conservation
   efforts in these areas ought to be enhanced and concentrated not only on
   saving what still remains of old-growth forest but also on managing
   remnants of grasslands and formerly grazed or mowed open forests around

Abstract = {{Lately there has been a shift in Sweden from grazing species-rich
   semi-natural grasslands towards grazing ex-arable fields in the modern
   agricultural landscape. Grazing ex-arable fields contain a fraction of
   the plant species richness confined to semi-natural grasslands. Still,
   they have been suggested as potential target sites for re-creation of
   semi-natural grasslands. We asked to what extent does fine-scale
   variation in soil conditions, management history and site location
   effect local plant diversity in grazed ex-arable fields. We examined
   local soil conditions such as texture, pH, organic carbon, nitrogen (N)
   and extractable phosphate (P) and effects on plant richness in ten pairs
   of grazed ex-fields and neighbouring semi-natural grasslands in
   different rural landscapes. Each grassland pair where in the same
   paddock. A multivariate test showed that site location and land use
   history explained more of differences in species richness than local
   soil property variables. Plant species richness was positively
   associated to grazed ex-fields with low pH, low N and P levels. Sites
   with high plant richness in semi-natural grasslands also had more
   species in the adjacent grazed ex-fields, compared to sites neighbouring
   less species-rich semi-natural grasslands. Although both soil properties
   and species richness were different in grazed ex-fields compared to
   semi-natural grassland, the site location within a landscape, and
   vicinity to species-rich grasslands, can override effects of soil
   properties. In conclusion, if properly located, ex-arable fields may be
   an important habitat to maintain plant diversity at larger

Abstract = {{The Pampas Meadowlark (Stumella defilippii) is considered a vulnerable

   Information about its nesting requirements, site fidelity and tolerance
   to current productive practices can be crucial for selecting an
   appropriate strategy for its conservation. This study was carried out on
   a breeding group found on a beef cattle farm in the southwest of Buenos
   Aires province. Plant species composition and vegetation cover at
   different heights were estimated at two scales, to identify possible
   parameters associated with nest site selection, The characteristics of
   these plots were compared with others selected at random in the
   immediate surroundings by discriminant analysis. Overall nest success
   was 0.29. Nests are associated with greater cover by bunch grass Stipa
   tenuis at the smaller scale, whereas in the larger plots the nests are
   positively related to areas of greater cover of S. tenuis, Aristida sp.,
   and also greater percentage of bare ground. Therefore the species
   appears to choose to nest next to thick grass clumps, but at the larger
   scale prefers fairly open ground. The successful nests appear to be
   associated with lower percentages of bare ground in the smaller plots
   when compared to the predated nests. The Pampas Meadowlark requires tall
   clumps of grass in relatively open ground to nest. Intermediate levels
   of grazing might result in appropriate conditions for this species to

Abstract = {{There may be significant benefits to understanding and managing

   achieving such gains is identifying the components of the soil

   molecular tools (DGGE and TRFLP) to assess the impacts of pasture type,
   grazing, timing, P fertilisation and sampling date on the structure of
   the soil bacterial, and fungal communities. Furthermore, the response of
   bacteria involved in defined ecosystem processes was determined by
   quantifying genes (qPCR) involved in nitrogen fixation (nifH),
   nitrification (amoA) and denitrification (narG). The strongest factor
   affecting the structure of the soil microbial community was timing of
   acidic soil. at the Book Book (New South Wales) field trial site
   (R>0.95; P<0.001). Effects of pasture type (annual vs. perennial) were
   minor. Addition of time (management of soil pH) increased the richness
   of fungal phylotypes (Margalefs index; P = 0.017) but not bacterial.
   phylotypes. Liming also increased the biological capacity for nitrogen
   fixation and nitrification (P<0.05). Across all treatments, there was a
   very good correlation between previous measures of N(2) fixed at the
   site and nifH gene abundance data (R(2) = 0.81). The biological.
   capacity for denitrification did not respond to pasture management. At a
   field site near Hall (Australian Capital Territory), an increase in the
   intensity of pasture production by phosphorus (P) fertiliser addition or
   increased stocking rate also affected the structure of the soil fungal
   and bacterial. communities (R = 0.8; P<0.001) and increased fungal
   phylotype richness (P<0.05). Significant shifts in the soil biota also
   occurred during the growing season (P = 0.001). These observations may
   have been strengthened by the onset of drought conditions from July
   2006. Richness of fungal, but not bacterial phylotypes, increased with P
   fertilisation, stocking rate, and between sampling times (P<0.05). The
   increase in fungal phylotypes richness was in direct contrast to a
   reduction in botanical diversity. Temporal variation in fungal richness
   was positively correlated with monthly rainfall (R(2) = 0.774). The
   biological capacity for nitrification and denitrification increased with
   intensification of the system (P<0.05), but the biological capacity for
   N(2) fixation increased with stocking rate only (P<0.05). Overall,
   results showed that soil biota under pastures, and particularly soil

   perennial grasses. Litter removal had similar effects to cutting,
   although it was far less effective in increasing species diversity. In
   the mowed area, cutting abandonment did not reduce species diversity,
   although the perennial grasses started to increase their cover, while
   several rare species reduced their abundance. Surprisingly, nitrogen

Abstract = {{Cynosurion cristati grasslands are semi-natural habitats that have
   developed on mesotrophic soils with a good water supply and are found
   from the basal up to the mountain vegetation belts. Differences between
   the various communities of these grasslands in the European continent
   have not been fully investigated; in Italy, there is a lack of knowledge
   of the mesophilous pastures in the central and southern Apennines. In
   order to shed light on the Cynosurion hay meadows and grasslands in the
   central Apennines, we considered phytosociological data from the Lepini
   and Prenestini mountains (central Italy, Tyrrhenian sector): 58 original
   releves and a synoptic table containing similar associations throughout
   the Italian peninsula were analysed using multivariate methods
   (hierarchical classifications and principal coordinates analysis). Two
   new associations were distinguished: Hordeum bulbosum meadows, grazed
   after being mown (Trifolio molinerii-Hordeetum bulbosi), and heavily
   grazed, unmown pastures with several thorny species (Centaureo
   calcitrapae-Lolietum perennis). Both these associations have been
   assigned to Cynosurion cristati, though they differ from the European
   coenoses owing to the presence of Festuco-Brometea and Helianthemetea
   guttati species. Further investigations are warranted to clarify the
   overall syntaxonomical position of the Italian coenoses in relation to
   the ecological and phytogeographic variations of Cynosurion, which are
   considered to be related to traditional land use in mountain
   agricultural systems. Hay meadows, which are important elements of
   landscape and biodiversity conservation, particularly feel the negative
   effects of land abandonment and land use change.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The rapid decline of semi-natural grasslands in Japan
   threatens many relic and endemic plant species. There is insufficient
   knowledge on how the impacts of land-use changes and management of
   grasslands have been affecting grassland ecosystems and what
   conservation measures may be taken to conserve as much of the existing
   plant diversity as possible.
   Aim: We assessed the existing management regimes for their suitability
   for conserving Red Data Book (RDB) species.
   Methods: We conducted our study in four districts of Kushima, Kyushu,
   south-west Japan, with different land-use histories. We compared species
   richness, plant density and abundance in six grassland types: regularly
   burnt, regularly mown, paddy levee, roadside, landslip and wetland
   communities in a total of 289 1 m x 1 m quadrats, recorded in 172
   grassland patches. Species richness plant density and abundance were
   analysed with special reference to RDB species under different land use
   history.
   Results: Species richness of grasslands did not differ across different
   land use histories, yet our analysis showed that the reduced area of
   grasslands markedly affected the density of RDB species. Grassland types
   differed in their ability to support RDB species: regularly burnt
   grasslands were the richest in RDB species and poorest in alien species,
   followed by regularly mown grasslands, paddy levees, landslip, wetland
   and roadside communities.
   Conclusions: Traditional management regimes, such as regular burning or
   mowing of grasslands have the best potential for conserving RDB species,
   and thus should be part of conservation management practices of
   semi-natural grasslands.}},

   Soomaa National Park, SW Estonia.
   A flexible quadrate size area inhabited by 500 ramets) was used for the
   estimation of life-form distribution, species richness, ramet density
   and weight of standing biomass. The size of the actual species pool
   (S-pool) was also estimated and relative richness (S-rel500) mean plant
   unit area (PUA), plant unit biomass (PUB), ramet density per square
   metre and standing dry biomass per square metre were calculated.
   Additionally, changes in Estonian floodplain grassland vegetation
   between the 1960s and the 1990s were analysed by comparing the life-form
   distribution of frequent species on floodplain grasslands in the 1960s
   and 1990s.
   Life-form distribution depended both on moisture conditions and on the
   management regime. Tussock-forming graminoids dominated in regularly
   mown moist sites and long-term un-mown wet sites, while mat-forming
   graminoids dominated in sites with irregular management, The proportion
   of herb ramets was highest in un-managed moist sites without regular
   mowing. In general, the life-form composition of floodplain grassland
   flora has shifted from low-growing herbaceous plants to tall-growing
   herbaceous plants during the abandonment period (from 1960s to 1990s).
   The effect of site moisture on the standing biomass-species richness
   relation and PUA was not significant, but the effect of the management
   regime was notable. PUA varied tenfold (mean 2.6 cm 2 at moist sites
   with the management regime B but was 25.2 cm(2) at un-managed wet
   sites). Dry standing biomass varied threefold depending on the
   management regime (from 263 to 763 g m (2)). Ramet density, PUA, PUB,
   S-pool and life-form distribution on plots with recently re-introduced

   D but did not differ from regularly mown plots (regime A).
   Management cessation led to a change in life-form distribution.
   Dominance of certain life-forms depended on site moisture but the most
   obvious change was the increase of vegetation height.}},

Abstract = {{The structure of bird assemblages recorded in breeding and wintering
   period in a Mediterranean wetland of Central Italy was studied in order
   to evaluate their seasonal changes and the influence of land cover on
   their parameters. We identified three habitat macro-types, according to
   a man-disturbed gradient (from natural to man-made macro-types). Bird
   assemblages showed differences in relation to season and habitat type,
   either at quantitative (species richness, diversity index) or
   qualitative level (species composition and turnover, similarity). In
   winter, we obtained the higher values of mean species richness, Margalef
   richness, Shannon diversity, and P-diversity. The dendrogram of
   similarity showed a major clear-cut division between seasons, and a
   secondary division among habitat macro-types. In winter, assemblages
   were more rich and diverse, with a high turnover among point counts. The
   semi-natural habitat macro-types showed always the higher values of
   these indexes, with the exception of the P-diversity, which showed the
   highest value in winter but the lowest in the breeding period. The high
   mean values of richness (a-diversity) of the semi-natural habitat
   macro-types, especially in the breeding period could be mainly explained
   by the `intermediate disturbance hypothesis'; on the contrary,
   differences in turn-over (P-diversity) between the seasons are mainly
   due to seasonal changes in habitat heterogeneity of this habitat
   macro-type (from an and homogeneous pasture to a patchy flooded one). A
   pattern of intermediate disturbance was evident at mean species richness
   level (significant values) but not at diversity index level (not
   significant values). These results Could imply specific strategies for
   the management of small wetlands, focused on maintaining a regime of
   natural (flooding) and man-made (grazing) disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing can change plant community composition and structure, which may
   alter the functions of the shrub meadow ecosystem. Grazing effects on
   Potentilla fruticosa shrub community in the headwater region of the
   Yellow River, which is in core area of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, are
   studied to provide adequate protection decision-making. We investigated
   continuous grazing and seasonal enclosure effects on P. fruticosa shrub
   communities. Three sites of P. fruticosa shrub comprising both
   continuous grazing and seasonal enclosure treatments were selected. The
   size of each fenced plot of P. fruticosa shrub was about 3000 m(2), the
   stocking rate was about 5 heads per 100 m(2) in continuous grazing
   treatment. Three samplings were made in each growing season of 2003 and
   2004. Cover of vegetation, plant species composition and vegetation
   height were investigated in seven 1 x 1 m quadrates in each treatment.
   Above-ground biomass was measured in five 0.5 x 0.5 m quadrates. Shrub,
   forb, graminoid and sedge plant materials were clipped at ground level
   and oven-dried at 85 degrees C to a constant mass. Plant composition was
   affected by long term continuous grazing and changes were caused by forb
   species shifting. No apparent difference in species richness between the
   grazed and ungrazed communities over the growing months were found but
   the Shannon's diversity indices of the grazed communities in June and
   July were higher than that of the ungrazed but lower in the late August
   and September. Live vegetation cover was reduced by 6.7\%, 7.3\% and
   11.5\%, respectively, owing to grazing in July August and September, but
   not in June (P> 0.05). Forbs took up more than 50\% cover of the
   vegetation in both grazed and ungrazed treatments. Relative cover of
   sedges and forbs in ungrazed treatment decreased in July, August and
   September, while that of graminoids increased more than 70\% in the same
   period. Live vegetation height was reduced by 27\% (2004) and 23\%
   (2003) in late August and early September, but not in early growing
   season. Grazing reduced total above-ground biomass by 35\%, 37\% and
   36\% in July August and early September, respectively, and the reduction
   was mainly in forb biomass. Continuous grazing affects plant composition

Abstract = {{In an agricultural context promoting the development of sustainable
   grazing systems, horses have a significant role to play in the
   management of grasslands and their biodiversity. While the number of
   horses has been increasing in France and in Europe, the lack of data on
   how horses exploit pastures makes it difficult to propose management
   recommendations, although there is evidence that grass can cover the
   nutritional requirements of horses, and that pasture management can be
   used to manipulate vegetation dynamics. Our aim was to review recent
   knowledge of factors that affect the voluntary intake and feeding
   choices of grazing horses. Comparing these results with similar
   measurements that were made in ruminants will highlight the
   specificities of horses' feeding strategies. In order to cover their
   nutritional requirements, horses adjust their foraging behaviour (daily
   grazing time, instantaneous intake rate, feeding site selection) when
   facing variations of resource availability and quality. Their
   preferential selection of short vegetation regrowths is likely to favour
   vegetation and animal diversity by creating relatively stable open
   patches in pastures. In the future, we will analyse the effects of
   further animal characteristics and pasture management in order to
   produce practical recommendations for horse breeders.}},

Abstract = {{The complexity, variability and vastness of the northern Australian
   rangelands make it difficult to assess the risks associated with climate
   change. In this paper we present a methodology to help industry and
   primary producers assess risks associated with climate change and to
   assess the effectiveness of adaptation options in managing those risks.
   Our assessment involved three steps. Initially, the impacts and
   adaptation responses were documented in matrices by `experts' (rangeland
   and climate scientists). Then, a modified risk management framework was
   used to develop risk management matrices that identified important
   impacts, areas of greatest vulnerability ( combination of potential
   impact and adaptive capacity) and priority areas for action at the
   industry level. The process was easy to implement and useful for
   arranging and analysing large amounts of information ( both complex and
   interacting). Lastly, regional extension officers ( after minimal
   `climate literacy' training) could build on existing knowledge provided
   here and implement the risk management process in workshops with
   rangeland land managers. Their participation is likely to identify
   relevant and robust adaptive responses that are most likely to be
   included in regional and property management decisions. The process
   developed here for the grazing industry could be modified and used in
   other industries and sectors.
   By 2030, some areas of northern Australia will experience more droughts
   and lower summer rainfall. This poses a serious threat to the
   rangelands. Although the impacts and adaptive responses will vary
   between ecological and geographic systems, climate change is expected to
   have noticeable detrimental effects: reduced pasture growth and surface
   water availability; increased competition from woody vegetation;
   decreased production per head ( beef and wool) and gross margin; and
   adverse impacts on biodiversity. Further research and development is
   needed to identify the most vulnerable regions, and to inform policy in
   time to facilitate transitional change and enable land managers to
   implement those changes.}},

Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2009}},

Abstract = {{Buffel grass {[}Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link] has been widely introduced
   in the Australian rangelands as a consequence of its value for
   productive grazing, but tends to competitively establish in non-target
   areas such as remnant vegetation. In this study, we examined the
   influence landscape-scale and local-scale variables had upon the
   distribution of buffel grass in remnant poplar box (Eucalyptus populnea
   F. Muell.) dominant woodland fragments in the Brigalow Bioregion,
   Queensland. Buffel grass and variables thought to influence its
   distribution in the region were measured at 60 sites, which were
   selected based on the amount of native woodland retained in the
   landscape and patch size. An information-theoretic modelling approach
   and hierarchical partitioning revealed that the most influential
   variable was the percent of retained vegetation within a 1-km spatial
   extent. From this, we identified a critical threshold of similar to 30\%
   retained vegetation in the landscape, above which the model predicted
   buffel grass was not likely to occur in a woodland fragment. Other
   explanatory variables in the model were site based, and included litter
   cover and long-term rainfall. Given the paucity of information on the
   effect of buffel grass upon biodiversity values, we undertook
   exploratory analyses to determine whether buffel grass cover influenced
   the distribution of grass, forb and reptile species. We detected some
   trends; hierarchical partitioning revealed that buffel grass cover was
   the most important explanatory variable describing habitat preferences
   of four reptile species. However, establishing causal links -
   particularly between native grass and forb species and buffel grass -
   was problematic owing to possible confounding with grazing pressure. We
   conclude with a set of management recommendations aimed at reducing the
   spread of buffel grass into remnant woodlands.}},

Abstract = {{Woody vegetation thickening occurs in agri-ecosystems worldwide, often
   with negative consequences for production. Dense Callitris glaucophylla
   ( Joy Thomps. \& L. A. S. Johnson) stands affect landscapes across NW
   NSW, Australia, and strategies to reduce tree density to levels which
   maintain biodiversity values alongside agricultural production are
   currently being sought. We investigated soil chemical and groundcover
   patterns associated with individual small and large C. glaucophylla
   trees at six sites of variable management history and lithology in
   NWNSW, Australia. We posed two questions: ( 1) do individual C.
   glaucophylla trees impose patterns on soil and groundcover ( soil
   extractable P, C, N, Sand pH, litter biomass, litter P and pasture
   cover), and, ( 2) if patterns exist, do they differ between tree sizes?
   Results showed that extractable P, C and pH decreased away from trees of
   both sizes, but significantly higher values were recorded adjacent to
   the stem of large trees. Litter biomass exhibited a strong site-related
   trend independent of soil variables. Positive correlations between
   litter and soil variables existed for some sites and not others,
   indicative of processes such as grazing which contribute to the
   transport of litter away from the tree. Irrespective of tree size
   ground-storey vegetation cover increased significantly away from the
   stem, presumably as a consequence of competition for soil water.
   Further results indicated that single C. glaucophylla trees enrich soils
   in patterns analogous to other species in similar environments
   worldwide. However, localised soil improvements must be weighed up
   against the negative effects of decreased groundcover associated with
   trees, and the potential for the species to re-seed prolifically into
   managed paddocks. Future research will discern the impact of individual
   C. glaucophylla trees at higher densities, where soil patterning may be
   modified by intense within-stand competition.}},

Abstract = {{An assessment of the relative influences of management and environment
   on the composition of floodplain grasslands of north-western New South

   reserves). A total of 364 taxa belonging to 55 different plant families
   was recorded. Partitioning of variance with redundancy analysis
   determined that environmental variables accounted for a greater
   proportion (61.3\%) of the explained variance in species composition
   than disturbance-related variables (37.6\%). Soil type (and fertility),
   sampling time and rainfall had a strong influence on species composition
   and there were also east-west variations in composition across the
   region. Of the disturbance-related variables, cultivation, stocking rate
   and flooding frequency were all influential. Total, native, forb, shrub
   and subshrub richness were positively correlated with increasing time
   since cultivation. Flood frequency was positively correlated with
   graminoid species richness and was negatively correlated with total and
   forb species richness. Site species richness was also influenced by
   environmental variables (e. g. soil type and rainfall). Despite the
   resilience of these grasslands, some forms of severe disturbance (e. g.
   several years of cultivation) can result in removal of some dominant
   perennial grasses (e. g. Astrebla spp.) and an increase in disturbance
   specialists. A simple heuristic transitional model is proposed that has
   conceptual thresholds for plant biodiversity status. This knowledge

Abstract = {{Montane meadows in the Zhongtiao Mountains ( located at 111 degrees
   15'-112 degrees 37'E, 34 degrees 36'-35 degrees 53'N) of North China are
   important for local animal husbandry and the provision of ecosystem
   services. However, owing to poor management, serious degradation has
   occurred on these subalpine meadows. The aim of this paper is to present
   a quantitative analysis of effects of stocking rate, grazing intensity,
   soil and topography on the status and diversity of montane meadow
   communities and to provide direction for improved management. Three
   regions in the Zhongtiao Mountain meadows were selected for monitoring
   the impacts of stocking rates and different grazing intensities on the
   meadow plant communities. Forty-one plots of 10 x 10 m and quadrats of 1
   x 1 m in each plot were set up to collect data on site characteristics
   and vegetation status in the three regions. The relationships between
   community composition and structure, species diversity, and grazing
   intensity, soil and topographic variables were analysed by multivariate
   methods (TWINSPAN, DCA and CCA). The results showed that nine meadow
   communities were identified by TWINSPAN. The first DCA and CCA axis
   identified a grazing intensity gradient, which illustrated that grazing
   intensity was an important factor influencing meadow types, composition
   and structure. Soil and topographic variables were also important to
   meadow vegetation, although most soil variables were sensitive to
   grazing intensity. Species richness, diversity and evenness were closely
   related to grazing intensity. It is concluded that grazing intensity and
   grazing method must be changed from the current heavy continuous grazing
   to rotational grazing to enable grassland rehabilitation to occur in the
   meadows of the Zhongtiao Mountains.}},

Title = {{Do elephants influence the organisation and function of a South African
   grassland?}},

Abstract = {{The impact of elephants (Loxodonta africana) on woody plants is well
   known. Elephants can be regarded as drivers of ecosystem functioning by,
   for example, decreasing woody plant litter accumulation through
   defoliation. However, their influence within grassland landscapes is, by
   comparison, very poorly understood. We assessed the influence of
   elephants on grassland functionality at three separate sites (1, high
   elephant density, long occupation time; 2, low elephant density, short
   occupation time; 3, no elephants) in the Addo Elephant National Park,
   Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. Using landscape function analysis
   (LFA) we described the landscape organisation of each site, and, using
   visual surrogates, calculated indices of landscape stability,
   infiltration and nutrient cycling. The number of vegetation patches/10 m
   of transects surveyed was higher at sites where elephant density was
   high (3 elephants/km(2)) and where elephants had been present for a long
   time (>70 years). However, patch size was significantly smaller when
   elephant density/time of occupation increased, and the proportion of
   bare soil was higher where elephant density and occupation time were
   highest. In addition, stability, infiltration and nutrient cycling
   indices at a site scale were significantly lower where elephants were
   present at high densities and after a long occupation time. However,
   bare soil stability was not greatly affected by elephant grazing
   pressure, implying that a `threshold of potential concern' has not yet
   arisen. We conclude that the functioning of this grassland landscape is
   significantly altered when elephants are present. These conclusions
   highlight the importance of management factors such as containment and
   the provision of artificial water points which may be compromising the
   functionality of these landscapes. We recommend ongoing assessments to
   inform future management decisions.}},

Abstract = {{To preserve species-rich grasslands, management practices such as mowing
   are often required. Mowing is known to promote aboveground conditions
   that help to maintain plant species richness, but whether belowground
   effects are important as well is not known. We hypothesized that if
   mowing decreases belowground carbon transfer by reducing root mass, this
   will reduce the abundance and activity of soil decomposers and lead to
   diminished nutrient availability in soil. In grasslands, this would
   provide a means to mitigate the negative effects of nitrogen enrichment
   on plant species richness. We established experimental plots on
   grassland with one-third of plots growing untouched, one-third mowed
   once a summer, and one-third mowed twice a summer for three growing
   seasons. Root and soil attributes were measured at each plot 1 month
   after each mowing. Mowing decreased root mass but had few effects on
   belowground biota and soil NH(4)-N, NO(3)-N, and PO(4)-P concentrations.
   Mowing did not affect root N concentrations. Our results show that
   despite reducing root mass, mowing may have few effects on those soil
   biota that control nutrient supply and, as a result, have no clear-cut
   effects on nutrient availability in soil. This suggests that the effects
   of mowing on soil decomposers and soil nutrient availability may not
   provide an effective means to mitigate N enrichment and enhance plant
   species richness in grasslands in a timescale of a few years. Whether
   such effects could, however, be achieved with longer lasting mowing
   remains open.}},

Abstract = {{The indirect effects of native generalist insect herbivores on

   limited attention. Crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum) is the most

   two experiments in a Crested wheatgrass-dominated grassland in western

   influences local Crested wheatgrass community composition by impeding
   native seedlings. Grasshopper herbivory negatively affected the species
   richness, abundance, and Shannon diversity of native plants in 3 of 4
   years. Although additional research is needed to determine if

Abstract = {{In this paper we compare the cryptogam vegetation in the
   Spergulo-Corynephoretum and Genisto-Callunetum in an inland drift-sand
   area in three periods (1968, 1993 and 2004). In the early period the
   lichen diversity in these plant communities appeared to be very high.
   The aspect was formed by Corynephorus canescens and Polytrichum
   piliferum. The highest numbers of lichen species are found in the S.-C.
   cladonietosum, irrespective of the period. In all years, variants of
   this subassociation are found, with many lichen species. In time pH
   decreases and organic matter, \% total N and \% total P increase by
   humus production. Cover sands having relatively high content of cations
   form a suitable substrate for lichens. Since the 1970s the neophytic
   moss Campylopus introflexus, a species adapted to acidic, nutrient-poor
   sand, has invaded the sand dunes. These changes have been attributed to
   the high aerial deposition of N in this central part of the Netherlands.
   In the more recent periods the actual lichen diversity did not really
   diminish, but the cover of lichen-rich plant communities was clearly
   reduced when encroaching mosses outgrew the lichens in all succession
   stages. However, when C. introflexus is less vital because of ageing,
   desiccation or burial under wind-blown sand; common humicole,
   aero-hygrophytic and even pioneer lichen species may locally establish
   on or between the moss cushions. The former succession series starting
   with P piliferum and ending with lichen-rich Calluna heath (1968) has
   been partly replaced by one including C. introflexus (1993 and 2004).
   Process management is necessary to keep the sand blowing and hereby
   reduce the colonization by C. introflexus. Habitat restoration by
   small-scale management consisting of cutting down self-sown trees and
   removing the top soil has positively influenced lichen diversity and
   needs to be continued.}},

Abstract = {{We tested predictions of the relative changes in plant leaf traits in
   response to land uses in Australian eucalypt grassy ecosystems.
   Predictions were determined from responses observed in European
   landscapes in relation to disturbances associated with agricultural land
   uses. We measured specific leaf area (SLA) and leaf dry matter content
   (LDMC) across five land uses: reference sites (closest to pre-European
   state), native pastures (unfertilized), fertilized pastures, sown
   pastures (cultivated and fertilized) and enriched grassland (previously
   fertilized, no longer grazed). Leaves were expected to have higher SLA
   and lower LMDC at sites with increasing fertility and/or disturbance.
   The predictions were confirmed, with SLA increasing progressively in
   land uses associated with (I) grazing; (2) grazing and fertilization;
   (3) grazing, fertilization and cultivation. Values for LDMC were closely
   (but inversely) correlated with those of SLA. For both traits, there
   were relationships with available soil phosphorus but not with soil
   total nitrogen. The positive correlation of SLA with phosphorus was not
   evident above 30 mg kg(-1), the recommended level of phosphorus for
   improved pastures.
   Results confirm patterns of leaf-trait response to disturbance that
   reflect fundamental constraints to plant survival in habitats with
   different levels of resources and disturbances. A conservative strategy
   for low productivity undisturbed habitats is associated with low SLA and
   high dry matter content in contrast to fertile disturbed habitats which
   select for high SLA and low dry matter content. The changes in leaf
   traits across land uses resulted from species substitution rather than
   variation within species across sites, and most notably the replacement
   of native by annual exotic species as land use intensifies.
   Recommended fertilization rates for pasture production convert the
   ground layer to plants with soft, digestible leaves, that are responsive
   to fertilizer and desirable for livestock production. However,
   fertilization also drastically reduces the diversity of native plants
   and annual plants tend to dominate. The trade-off associated with high
   production includes increased vulnerability to soil erosion, due to
   reduced plant cover and low persistence of cover. If alternative
   ecosystem values such as erosion control, water quality, salinity
   control and biodiversity persistence are required, incentives may be
   needed to offset the loss of production that can be gained from
   fertilizer application. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Changes in plant species richness at various spatial scales were

   of the research was to compare changes in species richness in newly
   abandoned sites and sites where restoration measures were applied after
   20 years of abandonment. The plots were located in two vegetation types
   with different moisture regime. Species richness decreased significantly
   after abandonment, mainly at the finest spatial scale of 10 x 10 cm.
   There was significant increase of species richness on restored sites,
   but it was apparent mainly at a larger scale. However, even 4 years of
   regular mowing were not sufficient to restore species richness to the
   level typical for traditionally managed grasslands in the region. No
   significant difference was found in the performance of the 2 contrasting
   vegetation types (wet and dry) in relation to management measures. A
   significant difference in scale-dependent species richness was only
   observed. The dry type had a steeper species-area curve, with a lower
   number of species at the finest spatial scale. According to the results
   of the experiment, mountain grasslands are very vulnerable habitats,
   losing their conservation value quickly after abandonment. Restoration
   is possible due to an extensive species pool in the region, but return

Abstract = {{Although population declines of grassland songbirds in North America and
   Europe are well-documented, the effect of local processes on regional
   population persistence is unclear. To assess population viability of
   grassland songbirds at a regional scale (similar to 150,000ha), we
   quantified Savannah Sparrow Passerculus sandwichensis and Bobolink
   Dolichonyx oryzivorus annual productivity, adult apparent survival,
   habitat selection, and density in the four most (regionally) common
   grassland treatments. We applied these data to a female-based,
   stochastic, pre-breeding population model to examine whether current
   grassland management practices can sustain viable populations of
   breeding songbirds. Additionally, we evaluated six conservation
   strategies to determine which would most effectively increase population
   trends. Given baseline conditions, over 10 years, simulations showed a
   slightly declining or stable Savannah Sparrow population (mean bootstrap
   lambda = 0.99; 95\% CI = 1.00-0.989) and severely declining Bobolink
   population (mean bootstrap lambda = 0.75; 95\% CI = 0.753-0.747).
   Savannah Sparrow populations were sensitive to increases in all
   demographic parameters, particularly adult survival. However for
   Bobolinks, increasing adult apparent survival, juvenile apparent
   survival, or preference by changing habitat selection cues for
   late-hayed fields (highest quality) only slightly decreased the rate of
   decline. For both species, increasing the amount of high-quality habitat
   (late- and middle-hayed) marginally slowed population declines;
   increasing the amount of low-quality habitat (early-hayed and grazed)
   marginally increased population declines. Both species were most
   sensitive to low productivity and survival on early-hayed fields,
   despite the fact that this habitat comprised only 18\% of the landscape.
   Management plans for all agricultural regions should increase quality on
   both low- and high-quality fields by balancing habitat needs, nesting
   phenology, and species' response to management. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Long-term effects of grassland management on the species richness of

   aftereffects of the previous treatments by recording the cover of
   vascular plants, mosses and lichens in nested plots with sizes from 0.01
   m(2) to 16 m(2). Vascular plant species richness as well as the number
   of species characteristic for calcareous grasslands were significantly
   lower in formerly abandoned or burnt plots than in regularly mown plots,

   The species richness of mosses did not differ between formerly abandoned

   species in the formerly abandoned plots. Mesophytic mosses were also
   more abundant in plots that used to be mown every second year than in

   negative impact of industrialized agriculture by providing subsidies to
   farmers for environmentally friendly agricultural practices,
   agri-environmental schemes (AES) are the most important policy
   instruments to protect European biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.
   However, as they are rarely cost-effective, there is an urgent need for
   evaluation and improvement. To assess the environmental effects of the
   Austrian AES, we mapped landscapes and vascular plants in 1998 and 2003
   and birds in 2003. The sampling areas were located in the three most
   important types of Austrian agricultural landscape, i.e., grassland in
   alpine valleys and basins, mixed agriculture in mountain areas, and
   eastern arable land. We investigated the agri-environmental measures
   (AEMs) in a parcel-wise manner and analyzed their effects on landscape
   values and biodiversity. Reduction of agrochemicals showed positive
   effects on biodiversity of vascular plants in grassland and birds in
   arable land. Targeted measures that directly address threatened species
   were most effective, but had much less coverage. Contradicting
   developments became apparent for landscape structure and ecological
   infrastructures, but effects of the AES were generally larger in simple
   than in complex landscapes. We conclude that AEMs are currently not
   targeted enough to effectively halt biodiversity losses, and recommend
   better regionalization by offering landscape-context specific measures,
   stronger focus on maintenance and improvement of landscape diversity,
   avoidance of counterproductive development, and improvement of the
   coverage of specific conservation measures.}},

Abstract = {{Modern agriculture is one of the main anthropogenic threats to
   biodiversity. To explore the effects of agricultural intensification we
   investigated carabids and spiders in two studies; in 2003 in grasslands
   and two years later in cereal fields in the same region. Both aimed to
   study the effect of management on arthropod diversity and composition at
   local and landscape scales. In 2003, we used a paired design for
   grasslands (extensively vs. intensively grazed). In 2005, a gradient
   design was applied with a total of seven land-use intensity categories.
   In both studies, sampling was carried out using funnel traps with the
   same sampling effort. Linear mixed models showed that high grazing
   intensity in grasslands had a positive effect on carabid species
   richness and abundance, but no effect on spiders. Landscape diversity
   had a positive effect only on carabid abundance. In the case of cereal
   fields, the management intensity (nitrogen fertiliser kg/ha) had a
   negative effect on spider richness and no effect on carabids. After
   variance partitioning, both local and landscape characteristics seem to
   be important for both cereal and grassland arthropod communities. Based
   on our results, we think that current and future agri-environmental

Abstract = {{During recent decades, concern about the loss of biodiversity on
   agricultural land has increased, and semi-natural grasslands have been
   highlighted as critical habitats. Temperate European agricultural
   landscapes require distinct and appropriate management to prevent
   further impoverishment of the flora and fauna. This is especially urgent
   for pollinating insects that provide important ecosystem services. Our
   aim was to examine how species richness of three important groups of
   pollinating insects; solitary bees, butterflies and burnet moths are
   related to different farm characteristics, and if there are any
   differences between these three groups. A further aim was to test if
   red-listed species are related to any farm characteristics. Species
   richness of solitary bees, butterflies and burnets was measured on all
   semi-natural grasslands at 16 farms in a forest-dominated area of 50
   km(2) in southern Sweden, using systematic transect walks in April to
   September 2003 (only butterflies and burnets) and 2005. Species richness
   of solitary bees and butterflies was intercorrelated, both before and
   after controlling for the area of semi-natural grassland. Species
   richness of solitary bees increased with the area of semi-natural
   grassland. After controlling for the effect of the area of semi-natural
   grassland species richness was strongly positively related with the
   density of the plant Knautia arvensis and negatively related with the
   proportion of grazed grassland. The results were similar for solitary
   bees and butterflies. The number of red-listed solitary bees was
   positively related to the proportion of meadows with late harvest (after
   mid-July) and decreased with increased farm isolation. The number of
   burnet species (all red-listed) was positively related to vegetation
   height, flower density and the proportion of meadows with late harvest
   on a farm. Areas with a high density of K. arvensis and with traditional
   hay-meadow with late harvest present, harbour most species. Promoting
   traditional hay-meadows, late extensive grazing and the herb K.
   arvensis, people managing agricultural biodiversity can encompass high
   species richness of pollinating insects and support red-listed species.
   Further, we suggest that the density of K. arvensis at a farm can be
   used as a biodiversity indicator, at least for pollinating insects.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we investigated the species richness and species
   composition in relation to light and management regime in remnants of
   wooded meadows within the riparian forests along the middle Drava River
   in Slovenia. 41 plots of still managed and, at different time periods (<
   5 yrs, 5-15 yrs, > 15 yrs), abandoned riparian wooded meadows (RWM) were
   sampled. In addition to vegetation relev,s, light intensity (PAR) was
   also measured in plots. Within the still-managed RWM, two floristically
   distinct types were recognized using TWINSPAN analysis: meadow-like and
   forest-like. Light intensity differed significantly between types. The
   CCA of active RWM showed a significant relation between species
   composition and light conditions. The number of species per relev, on
   active RWM was negatively correlated with light intensity - in contrast
   to North European wooded grasslands. This could be explained by the
   influence of species-rich riparian hornbeam forests that contribute many
   understorey species, in contrast to naturally mesotrophic meadows. CCA
   of both active and abandoned RWM demonstrated that light was a good
   predictor of RWM species composition and that abandonment caused
   profound changes in floristic composition. The species turnover during
   succession was more pronounced in less shaded meadow-like RWM where more
   light-requiring (grassland) species occurred. Species richness was the
   highest in active forest-like RWM. There were no significant differences
   in species richness between active meadow-like RWM and groups of
   abandoned RWM. The remains of riparian forests stretching along the
   flood plains of Central and Eastern Europe are considered one of the
   most natural ecosystems in the prevailing agricultural landscape. But
   naturalness could be in many cases only the consequence of abandonment
   of ancient land-use practices, like grazing of livestock, cutting
   between the trees, litter collecting, etc. Examination of the middle
   Drava River in Slovenia suggests the need to recognize the remains of
   ancient cultural landscape.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. In recent years, European water management policies have promoted
   floodplain rehabilitation for flood mitigation purposes. This could
   provide opportunities for the restoration of valuable floodplain
   meadows. However, during restoration projects, it is essential to
   understand the effects of the measures undertaken. In this study, we
   focus on the interaction between flood frequency and mowing in
   determining species composition of temperate lowland floodplain meadows.
   We hypothesized that the interaction of regular flooding with annual
   mowing would result in higher species richness than annual mowing or
   regular flooding alone.
   2. We compared the composition of annually mown and non-mown vegetation
   located in floodplain sites differing in flood frequencies. The presence
   of different plant growth forms and functional types was investigated in
   order to explain the mechanisms underlying the differences found.
   3. Both flood frequency and mowing affected species composition.
   However, flood regime was less important than mowing regime.
   4. Mowing was shown to strongly affect species composition by reducing
   productivity and competitiveness and offering opportunities for weak
   competitors. Annually mown sites harboured higher numbers of smaller
   species compared to non-mown sites which supported higher populations of
   tall graminoid species. CSR strategists (where C is competitiveness, S
   is stress-tolerance and R is ruderality) were most common in mown sites,
   demonstrating that mowing imposes a moderate degree of disturbance and
   nutrient stress.
   5. Only the combination of frequent flooding with annual mowing clearly
   increased species richness. This can be attributed to the fact that
   mowing provides the necessary gaps for germination of flood imported
   seeds.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Apart from focusing on the restoration of
   flood dynamics, managers should pay attention to the implementation and
   maintenance of extensive land management practices to ensure sustainable
   restoration results. Note that many European riparian sites have been
   abandoned during the last 20 years as a result of changes in policies
   and agricultural markets, yet annual disturbance and/or the creation of
   open vegetation gaps through annual mowing are necessary in order to
   maintain species-rich vegetations in these systems. The evaluation of
   possible administrative options bringing together the interests of
   farmers and conservationists is an important challenge in determining
   the restoration and preservation of these valuable floodplain habitats.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an assessment of the current and potential impaets of
   invasive alien plants on selected ecosystem servies in South Africa. We
   used data on the current and potential future distribution of 56
   invasive alien plant species to estimate thier impact on four serveies
   (surface water runoff, groundwater recharge, livestock production and
   biodiversity) in five terrestrial biomes. The estimated reductions in
   surface water runoff as a result of current invasions were > 3000
   million m(3) (about 7\% of the national tatal), most of which is form
   the fynbos (shrubland) and grassland biomes; the potential reductions
   would be more than eight times greater if invasive alien plants were to
   occupy the full extent of their potential range. Impacts on groundwater
   recharge would be less severe, potentially amounting to approxiately
   1.5\% orf the estimated maximum reductions in surface water runoff.
   Reductions in grazing capacity as a result of current levels of invasion
   amounted to just over 1\% of the potential number of livestock that
   could be supported. However, future impacts could increase to 71\%. A
   biodiversity intactness index (the remaining proportion of premodern
   populations) ranged form 89\% to 71\% for the five biomes. With the
   exception of the fynobos biome, current invasions have almost no impact
   on biodiversity intanctness. Under future levels of invasion, however,
   these intanctness values decrease to around 30\% for the savanna, fynbos
   and grassland biomes, but to even lower values (13\% and 4\%) for the
   two karoo biomes. Thus, while the current impacts of invasive alien
   planets are relatively low (with the exception of those on surface water
   runoff), the future impacts could be very high. While the errors in
   these estimates are likely ot be substantial, the predicted impacts are
   suffiently large to suggest that there is serious cause for concern. (C)

Abstract = {{Island ecosystems differ from mainland ecosystems in their long-term

   Island to that on the nearby mainland. Contrary to previous reports, the
   island isolation effect resulted in lower gamma and beta diversity than
   on the mainland, because of the low species richness of beetles with low
   dispersal abilities. Few flightless beetles could invade Sado Island,
   even when the beech forests on the island were relatively adjacent to
   those on the mainland. Such a history of ecosystem formation could be
   the general pattern for continental-island mountain forests that were
   never connected to those of the mainland. We did not observe low alpha
   diversity of ground-dwelling beetles, suggesting that the cattle grazing
   history of the island has not changed environmental conditions for
   ground-dwelling beetles enough to reduce their diversity. In addition,
   cattle grazing increases the abundance of merdivorous insects by
   increasing the abundance of their food resource.}},

Abstract = {{Maculinea butterflies obligatory parasitize certain species of Myrmica

   nausithous and M. alcon. Experimental plots with different mowing
   regimes were established at eight sites in South-Eastern Germany, a
   region which still contains a number of relatively large, stable
   populations of these threatened butterfly species. Among the seven
   different ant species recorded, four belong to the genus Myrmica (M.
   scabrinodis, M. rubra, M. ruginodis and M. vandeli). Among these, M.
   scabrinodis results most abundant at all sites. In a CCA analysis of
   environmental variables recorded at the studied plots, ant species
   diversity appears largely determined by litter cover, mean temperature,
   and mean grass cover. Mowing once a year, in the second half of

   the species range in stock and rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus grazing, as
   well as greater protection and management of sites through protected

   the favourable conservation status of P. coridon, by facilitating
   appropriate habitat restoration and management. Weather played a part in

Abstract = {{Although snow cover plays an important role in structuring plant
   diversity in the alpine zone, there are few studies on the relationship

   transects of 60 m x 1 m for this study and described the changes in
   species diversity and composition associated with snow depth. With the
   division of snow depth into six classes, the highest species richness
   (S) and species diversity (H') occurred with an intermediate snow depth,
   i.e., class III and class IV, showing a unimodal curve with the increase
   in snow depth. The relationship between snow depth and plant diversity
   (both richness and Shannon index) could be depicted by quadratic
   equations. There was no evident relationship between diversity (both S
   and H') and soil water content, which implied that other more important
   factors influenced species diversity. The patterns of diversity found in
   our study were largely attributed to freeze-thaw alteration, length of
   growing season and disturbances of livestock grazing. Furthermore, snow
   depth affected species composition, as evaluated by the Sorensen's index

   intermediate snow depth was suitable for the survival and growth of many

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Sulphur (S) depletion of grassland soils has occurred in Europe for many
   decades. This is known to promote a decrease in ecosystem productivity
   and is suspected to alter plant community structure. Considering the
   strong links between nitrogen (N) and S metabolism in plants, these
   effects should depend on N availability. We tested this hypothesis in a
   pot experiment, considering a four grassland species plant mixture
   (three Poace ae s: Lolium perenne, Agrostis capillaris and Poa pratensis
   and one Fabace : Trifolium repens), and submitted it to a double N and S
   gradient. We used labelled N-15-fertilizer and S-34-fertilizer in order
   to determine both nutrient use efficiencies by each species and to
   analyze the influence of competition for these nutrients on plant
   mixture dynamics. We compared species relative physiological performance
   (RPP) in the monoculture and their relative ecological performance (REP)
   in the mixture of the four species. We analysed gradient effects at
   establishment and at regrowth after cutting. At establishment, grass
   production and S use efficiency increased along the N gradient. The S
   gradient slightly favoured the dominance of L. perenne, increased A.
   capillaris production and enhanced N use efficiency of both species. At
   regrowth, increased S promoted more significant effects, enhancing T.
   repens performance in increasing its N-2 fixation ability and
   maintaining this at high N. It also induced a change in grass species
   relative performance (dry matter production and N use efficiency) at
   high N, enhancing that of L. perenne and decreasing that of A.
   capillaris. At both establishment and regrowth, RPP did not reflect REP,
   meaning that species behave differently along the gradient when grown in
   mixture. Finally, the S gradient and the N gradient modulated relative
   plant species abundance. It appears that modulation of S availability
   could be used as a tool to drive grassland community structure.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing-induced degradation of grasslands is the primary impediment to
   the socioeconomic development of Inner Mongolia. It affects the entire
   environment of northern China. Understanding grassland dynamics is
   necessary for restoration and sustainable management of these degraded
   ecosystems. The recovery dynamics of a degraded Leymus chinensis (Trin.)
   Tzvel. grassland after removal of grazing was studied in comparison with
   its spatial variation along a grazing gradient, using its climax
   community as a benchmark. The species composition, diversity, and
   biomass of the grassland vegetation, as well as the attributes (height,
   density, and individual mass) of major species, were examined on the
   eight sites along the grazing gradient and in the recovering grassland
   over 11 years. The spatial pattern of grassland vegetation along the
   grazing gradient closely reflected its recovery trajectory over time.
   Both the spatial and the temporal processes exhibited the same shift in
   species dominance in association with grazing removal or less grazing
   intensity. Grassland degradation was accompanied by an increase in
   species density and a decrease in species size; this trend was reversed
   during recovery. This result suggested that the degraded grassland is
   highly resilient and that restoration could occur naturally by reducing
   or excluding grazing animals. However, some differences existed between
   the spatial and the temporal processes. Species richness was high on the
   light- or no-grazing sites along the gradient, but varied little during
   the recovery of the degraded grassland. Species evenness was high under
   moderate to light grazing along the gradient and was high at the
   beginning of the recovery period but not at the end. Although standing
   biomass improved significantly during the recovery period, it did not
   change significantly along the grazing gradient. These observed
   discrepancies were related to the intrinsic difference in the spatial
   versus temporal processes and are discussed together with the
   advantage/disadvantage of the grazing gradient versus dynamic monitoring
   methods in grassland dynamics studies.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands bird and biodiversity conservation aligned with livestock
   production. The Southern Cone Grasslands comprise one of the richest
   grazing and agricultural areas in the world, and consequently have been
   heavily altered by livestock and crop production, such that the natural
   features of the landscape have substantially changed. Currently, habitat
   loss through afforestation, agriculture and grazing are the main threats
   to the birds of this biome. A total of 480 bird species occur in the
   grasslands of Rio Grande do Sul, including several globally threatened
   species such as Saffron-cowled Blackbird (Xanthopsar flavus), Marsh
   Seedeater (Sporophila palustris), Chestnut Seedeater (Sporophila
   cinnamomea) and Black-and-white Monjita (Xolmis dominicanus). The few
   protected areas created in the Southern Cone Grasslands lack effective
   implementation and management. The poor state of the protected areas
   system, plus the ever increasing threats across the landscape, lead to
   an urgent need for a grassland conservation plan to be developed with
   the productive sector. In 2004, the four BirdLife International Partners
   who share the Southern Cone Grasslands created the Alianza del Pastizal.
   This innovative initiative aims to improve ecosystem management in
   priority grasslands areas through sustainable and low-impact uses that
   maintain and enhance the biodiversity value of the grasslands
   ecosystems, and improve the economic and social development of
   landowners and rural communities. In 2007, the Alianza undertook a pilot
   survey in three different Apropampa ranches in the Bage and Lavras do
   Sul regions of Rio Grande do Sul to obtain a preliminary understanding
   of how the current cattle-raising techniques affect the bird and
   vegetation communities. A total of 144 species of birds were recorded in
   the three properties, including five globally threatened species. The
   vegetation surveys found a total of 106 native grasses and herbs in open
   areas, and an absence of the exotic invasive anonni grass (Eragrotis
   plana), which combined indicate the high quality of the natural
   grasslands. Some of the management techniques employed on the ranches
   led to overgrazing and trampling, jeopardizing the growth of tall
   grasses, which are important for a number of bird species. In addition,
   cattle trampling in marshy areas dominated by the sedge (Eryngium
   pandanifolium) can cause serious damage to the vegetation and
   consequently habitat modification and loss. In general, the Bage and
   Lavras do Sul regions held good quality natural grasslands and important
   populations of globally and regionally threatened birds. By making a few
   changes to the current management regimes, ranchers could make a
   significant contribution to biodiversity conservation in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Eragrostis lehmanniana (Lehmann lovegrass) is an invasive perennial
   bunchgrass in semi-desert grasslands in the USA. We removed E.
   lehmanniana using glyphosate at three locations in south-eastern Arizona
   in 2003 and 2004 to evaluate the community response. We also sampled the
   seedbank five times during the course of the experiment to characterise
   viable seeds at the sites. Two of the sites with histories of livestock
   grazing responded similarly to the continued removal of E. lehmanniana,
   with significant increases in native cover and species richness, mainly
   attributable to herbaceous annual species. Over the course of the study,
   progressively fewer E. lehmanniana seeds and higher numbers of native
   annual herb seeds were germinated from seedbank samples of treated
   plots. At the third site, characterised by a history of intense
   agricultural use and drier conditions than the other sites, there was a
   large decrease in E. lehmanniana cover in all plots, followed by an
   increase in aggressive non-native species as well as native grasses. The
   seedbank at this site suggested potential for restoration, with native
   perennial grass species present in increasing quantities. The results of
   this study have implications for site restoration, should a means of
   permanently removing E. lehmanniana be found.}},

Abstract = {{Surprisingly, several studies over large scales have reported a positive
   spatial correlation of people and biodiversity. This pattern has
   important implications for conservation and has been documented for well
   studied taxa such as plants, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals.
   However, it is unknown whether the pattern applies also to invertebrates
   other than butterflies and more work is needed to establish whether the
   species-people relationship is explained by both variables correlating
   with other environmental factors. We studied whether grasshopper species
   richness (Orthoptera, suborder Caelifera) is related to human population
   size in European countries. As expected, the number of Caelifera species
   increases significantly with increasing human population size. But this
   is not the case when controlling for country area, latitude and number
   of plant species. Variations in Caelifera species richness are primarily
   associated with variations in plant species richness. Caelifera species
   richness also increases with decreasing mean annual precipitation, Gross
   Domestic Product per capita (used as an indicator for economic
   development) and net fertility rate of the human population. Our
   analysis confirms the hypothesis that the broad-scale human
   population-biodiversity correlations can be explained by concurrent
   variations in factors other than human population size such as plant
   species richness, environmental productivity, or habitat heterogeneity.
   Nonetheless, more populated countries in Europe still have more
   Caelifera species than less populated countries and this poses a
   particular challenge for conservation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands are threatened in Central Europe by intense
   fertilisation, afforestation or abandonment due to changes in
   agricultural practice during the last decades. Nature conservation but
   also management within the EU agri-environmental schemes (cross
   compliance with national good farming practices) seek to maintain these
   grasslands by management. The study presented here investigated the
   effects of different management treatments on grassland vegetation of
   various vegetation types. The treatments were low-intensity grazing,
   mulching once and twice a year and burning in winter. We investigated
   plant functional trait responses to the treatments aiming to identify
   dominant or differentiating processes of the treatments ruling trait
   responses. We assume that the processes `selective removal of the
   phytomass by grazing', `small scale soil disturbances', `treatment
   frequency', `nutrient conditions', `vertical defoliation' and `timing of
   the treatment' are associated with the response of the plant functional
   traits `life form','plant height', `canopy structure', `specific leaf
   area', `storage organs','lateral spread','plant persistence', `seed bank
   longevity', `start of flowering','duration of flowering' and `seed
   mass'.
   All treatments maintained grassland vegetation by regular phytomass
   removal with hemicryptophytes and perennials with clonal growth being
   dominant. Grazing encouraged woody life forms through selective removal
   of the phytomass and species with small seeds and persistent seed bank.
   A relation to soil disturbances was discussed. Mulching treatments were
   especially characterised by increasing dominance of ground-layer species
   through regular vertical defoliation close to the ground. Burning in
   winter benefited species with storage capacities for nutrients withdraw.
   The traits `plant height' and `SLA', associated with treatment frequency
   and nutrient conditions, as well as the phenological traits `start' and
   `duration of flowering', associated with the timing of the treatments,
   did not respond differently among the treatments.
   The study shows that the grasslands show a convergent response to
   management treatments from a functional point of view although they may
   be floristically divergent. Therefore, a functional approach is useful
   not only to understand the mechanisms behind changes in vegetation after
   applying certain management treatments but also to predict changes. (C)

Abstract = {{Insight is needed into how management influences soil biota when
   sustainable grassland systems are developed. A crop rotation of grass
   and maize can be sustainable in terms of efficient nutrient use.
   However, there is lack of information on the effect of such a crop
   rotation on soil biological quality. Earthworms, nematodes, bacteria and
   fungi were sampled over three years in a 36 years old experiment.
   Permanent arable land was compared with permanent grassland and with a
   ley-arable crop rotation. In the rotation, a period of three years of
   grassland (temporary grassland) was followed by a period of three years
   of arable land (temporary arable land) and vice versa. In the first year
   of arable cropping in the rotation, the number of earthworms was already
   low and not different from continuous cropping. In the three-year grass
   ley, the abundance of earthworms returned to the level of permanent
   grassland in the second year. However, the restoration of earthworm
   biomass took a minimum of three years. Furthermore, the anecic species
   did not recover the dominance they had in the permanent grassland. The
   numbers of herbivorous and microbivorous nematodes in the ley-crop
   rotation reached similar levels to those in the permanent treatments
   within one to two years. Although the same holds for the nematode genera
   composition, the Maturity Index and the proportion of omnivorous
   nematodes in the temporary treatments remained significantly lower than
   in their permanent counterparts. Differences in recovery were also found
   among microbial parameters. In the temporary treatments, bacterial
   growth rate and the capacity to degrade a suite of substrates recovered
   in the second year. However, the Community-Level Physiological Profiles;
   in the permanent grassland remained different from the other treatments.
   Our results suggest that many functions of soil biota that are well
   established in permanent grassland, are restored in a ley-arable crop
   rotation. However, due to a reduction in certain species, specific
   functions of these soil biota could be reduced or lost. The ley-arable
   crop rotations were intermediate to permanent grassland and continuous
   arable land in terms of functioning of soil biota (e. g.,
   N-mineralization). In terms of the functional aspects of the soil biota,
   permanent grassland might be preferable wherever possible. For maize
   cultivation, a ley-arable crop rotation is preferable to continuous
   arable land. However, a ley-arable crop rotation is only preferable to
   continuous arable cropping if it is not practised at the expense of
   permanent grassland at farm level. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights
