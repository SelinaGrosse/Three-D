Abstract = {{Regular mowing of grassland is often necessary for plant conservation,
   but uncut vegetation is needed by many arthropods for overwintering.
   This may lead to conflicting management strategies for plant and
   arthropod conservation. Rotational fallows are a possible solution. They
   provide a spatio-temporal mosaic of mown and unmown areas that may
   combine benefits to both plants and arthropods. We tested if rotational
   fallows enhance spider overwintering in fen meadows. Rotational fallows
   consisted of three adjoining strips 10 m wide and 35-50 m long. Each
   year, one of these strips was left unmown (fallow) in an alternating
   manner so that each strip was mown two out of three years. Spiders were
   sampled during spring with emergence traps in nine pairs of currently
   unmown fallow strips and completely mown reference plots. Fallows
   significantly enhanced orb-weavers (Araneidae), sac spiders
   (Clubionidae) and ground spiders (Gnaphosidae). However, only 4.7\% of
   the total variation in community composition was attributable to
   fallows. Community variation was larger between landscapes (34.5\%) and
   sites (38.2\%). Also beta diversity was much higher between landscapes
   (45 species) and sites (22 species) than between fallows and mown
   reference plots (10 species). We conclude that the first priority for
   spider conservation is to preserve as many fen meadows in different
   landscapes as possible. Locally, rotational fallows enhance
   overwintering of the above-mentioned spider families, which are
   sensitive to mowing in other grassland types as well. Thus, rotational
   fallows would probably foster spider conservation in a wide range of
   situations. However, stronger effects can be expected from larger and/or
   older fallow areas.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this paper is to evaluate the relative efficiency of two
   strategies that favour dung beetles conservation (Scarabaeinae,
   Aphodiinae, Geotrupinae) in Southern Europe: extensive grazing and wild
   ungulate management. We conducted a study in the French Cevennes
   national park/UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve where dung beetles are
   distributed in a dichotomous sheep (grasslands, shrublands) and deer
   (clearings, shrublands, forests) droppings dominating abroad landscape.
   Natural sheep droppings and deer lumps dung beetle assemblages have been
   sampled two consecutive years during spring, summer and autumn in five
   representative habitats. This sampling of natural assemblages allowed
   for the estimation of (i) the density of trophic resource in the
   habitats, (ii) the regional dung beetle fauna and the distribution of
   species among the habitats and (iii) the density of beetles in natural
   droppings and the evenness of assemblages. High diversity, high species
   density in droppings and high evenness were observed in grazed
   shrubland, whereas fewer species were observed in deer lumps. our
   results clearly showed that, while wild ungulates manure is not enough
   to ensure the conservation of the regional dung beetle species pool, the
   spatial habitat heterogeneity of grazed shrubland allows the local
   coexistence of numerous species. Consequently, one may expect that the
   conservation of European dung beetle fauna, especially Scarabaeinae and
   several long lifetime species, could be enhanced by extensive grazing.

Title = {{Long-term land-use changes and extinction of specialised butterflies}},
Journal = {{INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{197-207}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Land-use change in 450 ha in southern Sweden between 1814 and 2004
   was recorded. Butterflies and burnet moths were surveyed in 1904-1913
   and 2001-2005.
   2. We explore if local extinctions were related to land-use changes and
   species attributes.
   3. Land use changed drastically over the 190-year period, and the
   largest relative change occurred for hay meadows with late harvest,
   which decreased from 28\% to 0\%. The area changed from grasslands and
   grazed forests to being dominated by timber forests. Previous open
   grazed mixed woodlands changed to spruce plantations with clear-cuts.
   4. Of the 48 resident butterfly and burnet moths found a century ago,
   44\% have become extinct. The extinct Aporia crat oe gi, Colias palaeno,
   and Leptidea sinapis were abundant 100 years ago and had their highest
   densities in flower-rich glades in forest, a habitat which no longer
   exists.
   5. The butterfly extinctions could be predicted from species-specific
   attributes as a short flight length period (P 0.02), narrow habitat
   breadth (P < 0.02), small distribution area in Europe (P = 0.033) and
   possibly larvae food plant nitrogen class (P < 0.06). In a multiple
   logistic regression, the flight length period was the only significant
   variable because the independent variables were intercorrelated.
   6. We conclude that the most important factor explaining the high
   extinction rate is that flower-rich habitats have disappeared from both
   woodlands as well as from open farmlands. The most sensitive species are
   specialised species with a short summer flight which have gone extinct.
   Only the most unspecialised species still persist in the current
   landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural fallows, village commons and degraded forests, serve as
   important common community property resources throughout India, but due
   to their degraded status they are considered as `wastelands', having
   little economic value and poor biodiversity. A study on secondary
   Succession was conducted in agricultural fallows around Puducherry,
   India to review the negative image of `wastelands'. Chronosequences of
   four sites aged 2, 4, 10 and 50 years were used to investigate change in
   species composition and abundance, convergence with a nearby forest and
   to examine their economic use.
   A comparison of life-forms, species richness and diversity indices
   showed that herbaceous species dominated up to 10th year sere, from
   which point in succession, woody species became more common. It was in
   the 50th year sere that shrubs and secondary tree species occurring in
   nucleated clumps became dominant. A cluster analysis based on
   Bray-Curtis similarity index shows a sequential development of
   vegetation through time, though 50th year plots showed no convergence
   with the Tropical dry evergreen forest (TDEF), but the principal
   component analysis demonstrates a change in community structure from
   grasslands to shrub and secondary tree species' dominance. Presence of
   adults of five primary forest species found in the clumps indicates a
   fast rate of secondary succession, considering that grazing and resource
   removal occurred in the sites. The potential value of the `wastelands'
   is evident from the fact that 64 per cent of recorded species have
   economic use, which underlines the need for their sustainable
   utilization for better management of bioresources rather than converting
   them into monocultures. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Complex vegetation responses to soil disturbances in mountain grassland}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{199}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{77-88}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We studied vegetation responses to disturbances originated by ants and
   voles in subalpine grasslands in the Eastern Pyrenees. We compared the
   effects of these small-scale disturbances with those of a large-scale
   disturbance caused by ploughing. We wanted to know if these soil
   disturbances promoted species richness through the existence of a
   specific guild of plants colonizing these areas, and if this guild was
   the same for all soil disturbances, independently of their extent. In
   general, grassland vegetation seemed to recover relatively quickly from
   soil-displacement disturbances, and the effects could be scaled up in
   time and space in terms of species richness and composition. Vole mound
   composition was similar to that in the surrounding grassland, suggesting
   that mounds were rapidly colonized by the neighbouring vegetation.
   Vegetation composition differed between the grassland and the ant
   mounds. Grasses and erect dicots coped well with repeated disturbance,
   while rosette-forming species and sedges were very sensitive to it.
   Landscape processes could be important to understanding recolonization.
   Species from xeric grasslands were found in mesic grasslands when
   disturbed by ploughing and on the tops of active ant mounds. Furrows in
   mesic grasslands recovered well, but decades after disturbance showed
   long persistence of some xeric species and increased species richness
   compared to terraces, while xeric grasslands showed decreased richness.
   This suggests that, because of those disturbances, within-habitat
   diversity was increased, although landscape diversity was not. However,
   specific disturbances showed idiosyncratic effects, which could enhance
   the species richness globally. In ant-affected areas, the grassland
   itself showed the highest plant species richness, partially associated
   to the presence of some species with elaiosomes not, or only rarely,
   found in adjacent grasslands without ant mounds. Therefore, soil
   disturbances occurring at different spatial scales contributed to
   complexity in vegetation patterns in addition to abiotic factors and
   grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Soil microbial communities under three agricultural management systems
   (conventionally tilled crop-land, hayed pasture, and grazed pasture) and
   two fertilizer systems (inorganic fertilizer and poultry litter) were
   compared to that of a similar to 150-y-old forest near Watkinsville,
   Georgia. Both 16S rRNA gene clone libraries and phospholipid fatty acid
   (PLFA) analyses indicated that the structure and composition of
   bacterial communities in the forest soil were significantly different
   than in the agricultural soils. Within the agricultural soils, the
   effect of fertilizer amendment on bacterial communities was more
   dramatic than either land use or season. Fertilizer amendment altered
   the abundance of more bacterial groups throughout the agricultural
   soils. In addition, the changes in the composition of bacterial groups
   were more pronounced in cropland than in pastures. There was much less
   seasonal variation between the soil libraries. Community-level
   differences were associated with differences in soil pH, mineralizable
   carbon and nitrogen, and extractable nutrients. Bacterial community
   diversity exhibited a complex relationship with the land use intensity
   in these agro-ecosystems. The pastures had the highest bacterial
   diversity and could be characterized as having an intermediate degree of
   intervention compared to low intervention in forest and high
   intervention in cropland. Changes in bacterial diversity could be
   attributed to the abundance of a few operational taxonomic units (OTUs).
   The microdiversity of abundant OTUs in both forest and cropland was
   consistent with an increase in abundance of many phenotypically similar
   species rather than a single species for each OTU. Soil microbial
   communities were significantly altered by long-term agricultural
   management systems, especially fertilizer amendment, and these results
   provide a basis for promoting conservation agricultural systems. (c)

Abstract = {{This study investigated changes in the floristic composition of fertile
   grasslands in the Alps over the last 25 years. Between 2002 and 2004 in
   four regions we repeated a total of 259 phytosociological releves taken
   in the years 1975 to 1986 on the same sites. At the plot level, the
   releves of the two surveys differed on average by 41 \% to 51 \% in the
   species detected, with accompanying species contributing to the change
   by a disproportionately large amount. The floristic changes were
   significant if less distinct at the landscape level, pointing to a
   slightly intensified management. In particular, there is now a higher
   incidence of plants which benefit from a high nutrient supply and/or
   have good mowing tolerance. In Tujetsch, intensification was restricted
   to favourable sites, while extensification took place on steep slopes
   and at high altitudes. Since both roughage quality and species richness
   were predominantly maintained or even increased, we conclude that
   grassland management over the last 25 years has been largely
   sustainable. However, on sites with the highest management intensity at
   Chateau-d'Oex, there was an increase in weed species indicating
   degenerated swards, with a corresponding decrease in the indicator value
   for roughage quality. To prevent this undesirable development from
   occurring on a large scale in the Swiss Alps, we recommend that
   management of fertile grasslands should not be intensified beyond the
   productivity potential.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. Polymorphism has been described for a number of herbivorous insects,
   but little is known about whether differences in body colour cause
   fitness differences. In Chorthippus parallelus, three main colour morphs
   occur, namely brown, green, and dorsally striped.
   2. The present study examined colour morph abundances and morph-related
   differences in body size, oviposition rate, and offspring numbers in
   females of C. parallelus collected in 15 montane grasslands. The study
   also examined the effect of plant species richness, composition,
   community productivity, and solar radiation on colour morph frequency
   and fitness.
   3. The relative frequencies of the three colour morphs was 31.7\%
   (brown), 33.1\% (green), and 35.2\% (dorsally striped), but the morphs
   were not evenly distributed across the 15 sites.
   4. There was no effect of the habitat variables on the distribution of
   the green and the striped morph in the study sites, however 80\% of the
   variation in the abundances of the brown morph was explained by plant
   species richness and composition.
   5. Grasshopper size was equal among the morphs. Brown females laid
   significantly more egg pods than the green and dorsally striped morphs.
   There were no significant differences in offspring numbers among the
   colour morphs.
   6. Body colour in C. parallelus seems to be a fitness-relevant trait,
   raising the question of the evolutionary maintenance of polymorphism.}},

Title = {{Experimental verification of suction sampler capture efficiency in
   grasslands of differing vegetation height and structure}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1357-1363}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. Suction sampling is a popular method for the collection of
   quantitative data on grassland invertebrate populations, although there
   have been no detailed studies into the effectiveness of the method.
   2. We investigate the effect of effort (duration and number of suction
   samples) and sward height on the efficiency of suction sampling of
   grassland beetle, true bug, planthopper and spider Populations. We also
   compare Suction sampling with an absolute sampling method based on the
   destructive removal of turfs.
   3. Sampling for durations of 16 seconds was sufficient to collect 90\%
   of all individuals and species of grassland beetles, with less time
   required for the true bugs, spiders and planthoppers. The number of
   samples required to collect 90\% of the species was more variable,
   although in general 55 sub-samples was sufficient for all groups, except
   the true bugs. Increasing sward height had a negative effect on the
   capture efficiency of suction sampling.
   4. The assemblage structure of beetles, planthoppers and spiders was
   independent of the sampling method (suction or absolute) used.
   5. Synthesis and applications. In contrast to other sampling methods
   used in grassland habitats (e.g. sweep netting or pitfall trapping),
   suction sampling is an effective quantitative tool for the measurement
   of invertebrate diversity and assemblage structure providing sward
   height is included as a covariate. The effective sampling of beetles,
   true bugs, planthoppers and spiders altogether requires a minimum
   sampling effort of 110 sub-samples of duration of 16 seconds. Such
   sampling intensities can be adjusted depending on the taxa sampled, and
   we provide information to minimize sampling problems associated with
   this versatile technique. Suction sampling should remain an important
   component in the toolbox of experimental techniques used during both
   experimental and management sampling regimes within agroecosystems,
   grasslands or other low-lying vegetation types.}},

Title = {{Maximizing conservation benefit for grassland species with contrasting

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1401-1409}},

Abstract = {{1. Conservation management often encompasses multiple, alternative
   management actions on a given site, involving habitat restoration and
   maintenance for example. Which actions are preferable depends on the
   conservation goals, the expected outcomes of actions, and their
   associated costs. When actions affect habitat quality differently,
   species that vary in habitat requirements will not respond to the
   actions in the same way. When all these species are of conservation
   concern, trade-offs between them are inevitable and the selection of
   appropriate actions becomes less straightforward. Although this is a
   common planning problem, it has received little attention in the
   conservation planning literature.
   2. We demonstrate how to obtain cost-effective planning solutions for a
   set of species with contrasting requirements, when multiple alternative
   conservation actions are available for each site. We investigate the
   strength of trade-offs between species with different habitat
   preferences, when planning optimal management of a set of semi-natural
   mesic grassland sites. A community of vascular plants and Lepidoptera
   species depends on such grasslands, which are maintained by cattle
   grazing. The various species differ in their responses to grazing
   intensity. We apply an algorithm that selects a grazing intensity for
   each site to maximize the benefit over all species, under a given budget
   constraint.
   3. The optimal grazing intensity for sites, and consequently, the
   expected representation of species, was sensitive to the relative values
   assigned to species (weights) and the budget available. The outcome also
   depended on assumptions regarding species representation under
   suboptimal management. A sensitivity analysis showed that the trade-offs
   between species were strong, illustrating the potentially significant
   consequences of conservation decisions.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Maximizing conservation benefit over all
   species may result in high representation of some species at the cost of
   others. Although this is a natural consequence of budget limitations and
   conservation priorities, understanding these consequences is essential
   if planning is to accommodate species with different conservation needs.
   Our methodology is a novel extension of conventional reserve selection
   methods and can support planning for species with contrasting
   requirements, leading to more robust and cost-effective conservation
   decisions.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a rapid extirpation of a strong population of globally
   threatened butterfly, Colias myrmidone, from the White Carpathians,
   Czech Republic. The area is renowned for a high plant and insect
   diversity associated with savannah-like Carpathian meadows,
   traditionally managed by mowing once a year and subsequent autumn
   grazing. Although many meadows fell victim to land consolidation schemes
   in the 1970s and 1980s, over 2000 hectares have been preserved in a
   dense network of reserves. The reserve management practised since the
   mid-1990s has consisted of uniform machine mowing of entire areas and
   this was further accelerated after accession of the Czech Republic to
   the EU, when agri-environmental schemes (AES) required two cuts per
   year. This starkly conflicted with the life history of C. myrmidone,
   because both spring and autumn cuts interfere with larval development.
   Despite intensive surveys, only five and then two C. myrmidone
   individuals were seen in the area in 2005 and 2006, respectively,
   rendering the species effectively extinct. Conservation authorities
   failed by neglecting early warning signals issued by amateur
   entomologists, and by ignoring the basic tenets of conservation of
   insect diversity, such as the need to maintain heterogeneity of
   resources. Unless AES provide for this crucial aspect of habitat
   suitability for invertebrates, they may turn from a great hope into a
   massive failure.}},

Abstract = {{In Northern Fennoscandia, sub-arctic and arctic grasslands are commonly
   grazed by the semi-domesticated reindeer. Reindeer grazing is known to
   affect plant production and belowground processes, such as nutrient
   mineralization in these grasslands, but little is known of the role of
   plant Community Structure in the response of plant and soil properties
   to the defoliation of plants. Using soil and seeds from a low arctic
   meadow, we established a 23-week greenhouse experiment to test whether
   communities of different plant species richness (one, two or four
   species) and composition (three different replicated compositions within
   each richness level) respond to defoliation in a different way. We
   defoliated plants twice to 2 cm above the soil surface in half of the
   replicates of each community and analyzed the response of different
   communities in terms of changes in plant mass accumulation and the
   abundance of soil organisms (microbes, protozoa and nematodes). We
   predicted that these parameters and their resistance to defoliation
   will: (1) differ among plant species compositions; and (2) increase with
   increasing plant species richness. We found that plant species
   composition affected shoot mass accumulation (comprising both defoliated
   and harvested shoot mass), harvested root mass (in nondefoliated
   systems) and the abundance of decomposer fungi in the soil. Defoliation
   increased the numbers of fungal-feeding and predatory nematodes
   regardless of plant community structure, while the effects on roots and
   decomposer fungi varied across plant species compositions. Of the
   measured variables, only the abundance of omnivorous Aporcelaimellus
   spp. nematodes responded to plant species richness and no evidence was
   found that the effects of defoliation on any variable were modified by
   species richness. Soil bacteria, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, protozoa
   and bacterial- and root-feeding nematodes did not respond to any
   treatment. Our results suggest that defoliation effects may to some
   extent differ between different plant species compositions in the low
   arctic grasslands grazed by the reindeer. However, it appears that they
   may not depend on plant species richness. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We examined how elevated atmospheric (CO2] and higher rate of nitrogen
   (N) input may influence grasshopper growth by changing food plant
   quality and how such effects may be modified by species diversity of the
   plant community. We reared grasshopper nymphs (Melanoplus femurrubrum)
   on Poa pratensis from field-grown monocultures or polycultures (16
   species) that were subjected to either ambient or elevated levels Of CO2
   and N. Grasshopper growth rate was higher on P. pratensis leaves grown
   in monocultures than in polycultures, higher on P. pratensis grown under
   elevated than under ambient {[}CO2], and higher on P. pratensis grown
   under elevated than under ambient {[}N]. The higher growth rate observed
   on P. pratensis exposed to elevated {[}CO2] was, however, less
   pronounced for polyculture- than monoculture-grown P. pratensis. Growth
   rate of the grasshoppers was positively correlated with leaf {[}N],
   {[}C], and concentration of soluble carbohydrates + lipids.
   Concentration of non-structural carbohydrates + lipids was higher in
   leaves grown under elevated than under ambient {[}Co-2], and the
   difference between P. pratensis grown under ambient and elevated {[}CO2]
   was greater for monoculture- than polyculture-grown P. pratensis. In
   addition, leaf N concentration was higher in P. pratensis grown in
   monocultures than in polycultures, suggesting that plant species
   richness, indirectly, may influence insect performance by changed
   nutritional value of the plants. Because we found interactive effects
   between all factors included ({[}CO2], {[}N], and plant species
   diversity), our results suggest that these parameters may influence
   plant-insect interactions in a complex way that is not predictable from
   the sum of single factor manipulations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Abstract = {{Widespread degradation of Mongolian grasslands by overgrazing is of
   global concern. The objective of this study was to reveal the effects of
   grazing on pollination as an example of interaction biodiversity in
   Mongolian grasslands. We established three plots according to grazing
   intensity on the eastern steppe of Mongolia. In each plot, we recorded
   the numbers of insect-pollinated plants and observed the foraging
   behavior of pollinators in June and August. The richness of
   insect-pollinated species was high and these species were most abundant
   in lightly grazed plots, and formed complex relations with diverse
   pollinators. But, frequency of flower visitation and pollination index
   were greater in heavily grazed plots. All pollination properties were
   poorest in intermediately grazed plots. These results suggest that the
   forb-biased foraging of sheep and goats reduces the floral diversity of
   insect-pollinated species, and consequently reduces pollinators in the
   intermediately grazed plots. In the heavily grazed plots, only limited
   ruderal species could survive under heavy cattle grazing, and such
   simple vegetation formed unbalanced but strong bonds with pollinators.
   Removal simulation showed that the mutual network was more fragile with
   respect to the extinction of certain species. Crown Copyright (C) 2008

Abstract = {{Aim To determine whether arthropod richness and abundance for combined
   taxa, feeding guilds and broad taxonomic groups respond in a globally
   consistent manner to a range of agricultural land-use and management
   intensification scenarios.
   Location Mixed land-use agricultural landscapes, globally.
   Methods We performed a series of meta-analyses using arthropod richness
   and abundance data derived from the published literature. Richness and
   abundance were compared among land uses that commonly occur in
   agricultural landscapes and that represent a gradient of increasing
   intensification. These included land-use comparisons, such as wooded
   native vegetation compared with improved pasture, and a management
   comparison, reduced-input cropping compared with conventional cropping.
   Data were analysed using three different meta-analytical techniques,
   including a simple vote counting method and a formal
   fixed-effects/random-effects meta-analysis.
   Results Arthropod richness was significantly higher in areas of less
   intensive land use. The decline in arthropod richness was greater
   between native vegetation and agricultural land uses than among
   different agricultural land uses. These patterns were evident for all
   taxa combined, predators and decomposers, but not herbivorous taxa.
   Overall, arthropod abundance was greater in native vegetation than in
   agricultural lands and under reduced-input cropping compared with
   conventional cropping. Again, this trend was largely mirrored by
   predators and decomposers, but not herbivores.
   Main conclusions The greater arthropod richness found in native
   vegetation relative to agricultural land types indicates that in
   production landscapes still containing considerable native vegetation,
   retention of that vegetation may well be the most effective method of
   conserving arthropod biodiversity. Conversely, in highly intensified
   agricultural landscapes with little remaining native vegetation, the
   employment of reduced-input crop management and the provision of
   relatively low-intensity agricultural land uses, such as pasture, may
   prove effective in maintaining arthropod diversity, and potentially in
   promoting functionally important groups such as predators and
   decomposers.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{77}},

Abstract = {{1. Recent biodiversity studies have addressed various community-level
   effects of biodiversity change, but the number of studies on specific
   biotic interactions is still rather limited. An open question in the
   context of plant-insect-herbivore relationships is how diversity impacts
   the population ecology of individual species.
   2. In the present study, we explored the relationship between plant
   species diversity and the performance and fitness of a generalist
   herbivore, the meadow grasshopper Chorthippus parallelus Zetterstedt
   (Orthoptera, Gomphocerinae). A total of 1620 fourth-instar nymphs of
   this insect were captured and transferred to cages (10 females and 10
   males per cage) on 81 experimental grassland communities in plots
   containing one to 60 plant species within the Jena biodiversity
   experiment.
   3. Median survival of grasshoppers in the experiment was 14.5 days.
   Survival was independent of plant species richness and number of plant
   functional groups in the communities, but increased if plant communities
   contained grasses. Plant species richness and plant functional group
   richness had no effect on the number of oothecae laid by females or the
   number of hatchlings in the next generation.
   4. Functional group composition of the plant communities affected most
   fitness measures. Grass presence increased the number of oothecae laid
   by females from 0.78 +/- 0.21 to 3.7 +/- 0.41 per female, and the number
   of hatchlings in the next generation from 4.0 +/- 1.3 to 16.6 +/- 2.4.
   Certain combinations of plant functional groups increased grasshopper
   survival.
   5. The findings indicate that the fitness of C. parallelus is influenced
   more by plant functional group identity than by plant species richness.
   In the absence of grasses, grasshoppers performed better if more than
   just one functional group of plants was present. We call this a `rescue
   effect' of plant functional group richness.}},

Title = {{Sustaining ecosystem services in ancient limestone grassland: importance

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{1. Limestone grasslands are among the most floristically rich ecosystems
   in northern Europe and have recently been shown to sustain ecosystem
   functioning under conditions of heavy nitrogen (N) deposition. Here we
   report a long-term mesocosm experiment, designed to measure the
   importance of major component plants and community composition in
   providing ecosystem services (in particular preventing leaching of
   inorganic N).
   2. A number of important steps were taken in the experimental design to
   increase conformity of the experimental communities to real limestone
   pasture, including using natural soils, plant cuttings of limestone
   grassland provenance and simulated management. Furthermore, communities
   were allowed to establish for 8 years before measurements were made.
   3. Leaching of NO(3)(-) and NH(4)(+) and were found to differ by up to a
   considerable two orders of magnitude according to functional group
   composition, with sedges and forbs leaching the most. Grass communities
   and communities containing all three functional groups (grasses, sedges
   and forbs) leached similarly low amounts of NO(3)(-) and NH(4)(+).
   4. Levels of soil NO(3)(-) and NH(4)(+) followed a similar pattern of
   inter-community differences to leaching, while vegetation biomass and
   vegetation N stocks were very similar between communities consisting of
   only grasses, only sedges and the most species rich community (4 grasses
   + 4 sedges + 4 forbs).
   5. Perennial grasses appeared to play the key role in inorganic N
   retention, with communities consisting of these plants having equally
   low leaching as more species rich communities. Indeed, most ecosystem
   services were performed comparatively well by grass communities as by
   the most species rich community.
   6. No overall effects on provision of services resulted from mixing
   functional groups or increasing the number of species representing each
   functional group.
   7. Synthesis. This work shows that more than order-of-magnitude
   differences in provision of ecosystem services can occur between species
   that coexist naturally in ancient limestone pasture. However, despite
   these large differences, because of the key role played by grasses,
   expected shifts in community composition anticipated as a result of N
   pollution may not impair the capacity of these systems to provide
   ecosystems services.}},

Title = {{The relative importance of the species pool, productivity and
   disturbance in regulating grassland plant species richness: a field
   experiment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{937-946}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Ecologists have generally focused on how species interactions and
   available niches control species richness. However, the number of
   species in the regional species pool may also control richness.
   Moreover, the relative influence of the species pool and species
   interactions on plant richness may change along productivity and
   disturbance gradients.
   2. We test the hypothesis that many species from the propagule pool will
   colonize into habitats of moderate productivity and moderate
   disturbance, and the number of species in the pool will, therefore,
   primarily control plant species richness in such habitats. The
   hypothesis also states that few species from the propagule pool will
   colonize into habitats of high productivity and minimal disturbance
   because competitive species interactions primarily control plant
   richness in such habitats.
   3. To test this hypothesis, we experimentally varied resource
   availability via fertilization and irrigation, the size of the available
   propagule pool via sowing the seeds of 49 species and disturbance via
   vegetation clipping.
   4. A larger propagule pool increased species richness 80\% in the
   absence of fertilization and the presence of clipping but had no
   significant effect on richness in the presence of fertilization and the
   absence of clipping (significant fertilization x clipping x seed
   addition interaction). Irrigation increased species richness primarily
   in the absence of fertilization and the presence or clipping
   (significant fertilization x clipping x irrigation interaction).
   5. Synthesis. These results support the assertion that the control of
   plant species richness shifts from the number of species in the
   propagule pool to the intensity of species interactions as productivity
   due to soil fertility increases and disturbance decreases. However,
   increases in productivity due to irrigation caused an increase in
   species richness, probably because of reduced seedling desiccation.
   Other studies have found similar outcomes along natural productivity
   gradients where productivity is confounded with other variables, but
   this study is the first to find such an outcome along an experimental
   productivity gradient. These results suggest habitats with moderate soil
   fertility and disturbance may be more open to colonization from the
   propagule pool than other habitats, a finding that has implications for
   plant restoration and invasive species management.}},

Abstract = {{Soil properties (i.e. soil organic carbon, SOC; soil organic nitrogen,
   SON; and soil C/N ratio) and vegetation in a semiarid grassland of Inner
   Mongolia, northern China, were studied with the method of geostatistical
   analysis. We examined the spatial heterogeneity of soil and plants, and
   possible impacts of land use on their heterogeneity and on the
   relationship between soil resources and plant richness. Land use
   affected small scale spatial heterogeneity in plants and soil. SOC, SON
   and C/N ratio displayed autocorrelation over a range of similar to 2 m
   under most circumstances on sites where livestock grazing had been
   excluded. The uncontrolled grazing site (UG, i.e. unregulated grazing by
   excessive livestock) displayed an increased range of spatial
   autocorrelation and the total amount of variability in soil nitrogen
   over the other land use types. Plant life forms and plant species
   exhibited spatial autocorrelation over a range of about 2 m on the
   grazing exclusion (GE) and mowed (MW) sites, while pattern of spatial
   autocorrelation for several less common species on the UG site were
   difficult to predict. Plant species richness was positively related with
   spatial heterogeneity of SOC, SON and C/N on both GE and MW sites, and
   with only SOC heterogeneity on the UG site. These suggest that spatial
   soil heterogeneity plays an active role in maintaining plant species
   richness. However, we call for caution in generalization of the control
   of spatial soil heterogeneity over plant richness when multiple modes of
   disturbances are present, as we found in this study that higher total
   amount of variation in soil nitrogen and C/N ratio on the over-grazed UG
   site did not lead to increased plant species richness, and that land use
   had apparent effects on the patterns of spatial heterogeneity in both
   vegetation and soil.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that small rock-enclosed geologic refuges have
   an important role in maintaining grazing-sensitive species in grassland
   with a long history of intense grazing. The study was carried out in
   Mediterranean grassland in a basalt landscape in northern Israel.
   Community composition was compared in 63 sites between samples of 1 m(2)
   quadrats in two microhabitats: (1) rock-enclosed, presumed ``refuges{''}
   and (2) rock-adjacent, ``near refuges{''} but just outside them,
   accessible to cattle grazing. Median refuge area was 2.75 m(2), median
   rock height and diameter around refuges were 1.10 m and 1.50 m. Median
   height of residual dry herbage was 1.41 m in refuges, compared to 0.38 m
   outside, indicating the difference in grazing intensity. Species
   richness at three scales (quadrat, site, all sites) was significantly
   greater in the near-refuge than in the refuge habitat. In the latter,
   many annuals were excluded by dominance of tall perennials. Twelve
   species (of 103) had significantly higher cover in refuges, including
   tall perennial grasses, tall annuals, climbers, and a shrub. A total of
   53 species with a strong significant negative response to refuges were
   mostly small and medium height annuals. The intermediate group of 38
   species with weak or non-significant responses to refuges included,
   among others, dominant tall grasses that were abundant both in refuges
   and just outside them. The latter, as well as most refuge-positive
   species had shown a positive response to protection in exclosures. The
   results support the hypothesis that small rock-enclosed habitats-more so
   than artificial exclosures-are effective grazing refuges for rare,
   grazing-susceptible species. The contribution of refuges to species
   richness at the landscape scale is much greater than their proportion of
   the area. Dispersion from refuges maintains small populations of rare
   species near refuges and can initiate expansion into the landscape when
   grazing pressure is lowered.}},

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{509-520}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge of how tallgrass prairie vegetation responds to fire in the
   late growing season is relatively sparse and is based upon Studies that
   are either spatially or temporally limited. To gain a more robust
   perspective of vegetation response to Summer burning and to determine if
   repeated summer fire can drive vegetational changes in native tallgrass
   prairie, we evaluated species cover and richness over a 14-yr period on
   different topographic positions from ungrazed watersheds that were
   burned biennially in the growing season. We found that annual forbs were
   the primary beneficiaries Of summer burning, but their fluctuations
   varied inconsistently among years. Concomitantly, species richness and
   diversity increased significantly with summer burning but remained
   stable through time with annual spring burning. After 14 yr, species
   richness was 28\% higher in prairie that was burned in the summer than
   in prairie burned in the spring. Canopy cover of big bluestem
   (Andropogon gerardii Vitman) and Indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans {[}L.]
   Nash) increased significantly over time with both Summer and spring
   burning, whereas heath aster (Symphyotrichum ericoides {[}L.] Nesom),
   aromatic aster (Symphyotrichum oblongifolium {[}Nutt.] Nesom), and
   sedges (Carex spp.) increased in response to only Summer burning.
   Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) cover declined in both
   spring-burned and summer-burned watersheds. Repeated burning in either
   spring or Summer did not reduce the cover or frequency of any woody
   species. Most perennial species were neutral in their reaction to summer
   fire, but a few species responded with large and inconsistent temporal
   fluctuations that overwhelmed any clear patterns of change. Although
   summer burning did not preferentially encourage spring-flowering forbs
   or suppress dominance of the warm-season grasses, it is a potentially
   useful tool to increase community heterogeneity in ungrazed prairie.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing is one of the most common forms of land use in the
   western United States, yet scientists struggle to accurately predict
   grazing impacts. This study examined the initial response of desert
   horned lizards (Phrynosoma platyrhinos) to cattle introduction at a site
   in northwestern Utah. We sampled 21 grazed and 7 ungrazed study plots
   before grazing (2001), after grazing (2002), and 1 year after the
   cessation of grazing (2003). We were specifically interested in whether
   grazing influenced lizards through biotic or abiotic pathways. Lizard
   response (based on scat counts) to the initial impact of grazing (<6
   months after cattle introduction) suggests that lizards abandoned areas
   protected from grazing (i.e., ungrazed exclosures) presumably in favor
   of grazed areas. Avoidance of ungrazed plots by lizards coincided with a
   decline in shrub and grass cover on grazed plots and with no significant
   change in relative abundance or richness of prey (ants) on grazed plots.
   In 2003, one year after cattle had been removed from the site, prey
   species richness declined on ungrazed plots, and percent bare ground
   increased on previously grazed plots; however; we detected no response
   of lizards to these changes. Overall, these results add to growing
   consensus that responses by small vertebrates to grazing are largely the
   result of changes to habitat structure(i.e., vegetation cover), rather
   than to changes in prey availability. Importantly, results from our
   relatively unique evaluation of initial grazing impacts corroborate
   results from more classic grazing studies conducted sometime after
   grazing has commenced and suggest that responses of small vertebrates to
   changes in habitat structure may be generalizable.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted between 2001 and 2003 in constructed plant
   communities that were set up in 1996 on abandoned agricultural land. The
   primary aim of the experiment was to study how different secondary
   vegetation succession scenarios influence community development of
   invertebrates in different trophic levels. The succession scenarios were
   obtained by sowing high diversity or low diversity seed mixtures of
   mid-successional plant species in 1996 in comparison with unsown plots
   where agriculture ceased in 1996 or 1999. Carnivorous carabid species
   generally preferred plots characterized by open vegetation, whereas
   herbivorous carabids generally favored plots associated with high plant
   diversity. However, carabid community composition was affected most by
   sampling year and there was also a dramatic shift over the three years
   in the relative proportion of the different trophic groups. Irrespective
   of treatment, the proportion of carnivores in the community declined
   with time, whereas phytophages increased over the course of the three
   years. By contrast, the proportion of omnivores peaked during the second
   year. These long-term changes were, at least to some extent, related to
   short-term changes in the structure and composition of the plant
   communities. The importance of local variation and temporal changes in
   plant species richness on carabids and other insect fauna are discussed.

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Question: Are the seed banks of an isolated Subtropical oceanic island
   capable of naturally regenerating vegetation either with species of the
   historical forest community or with the existing grassland community
   after severe damage to the vegetation by goats?
   Location: Nakoudojima Island, Bonin Archipelago (Ogasawara Shoto).
   Japan.
   Methods: Soil samples were collected at 0-5 cm and 5-10 cut depths from
   seven plots in forests. grasslands, artificially matted areas and bare
   land. Soil seed banks were assessed using the seedling emergence method
   Followed by the hand-sorting of Ungerminated seeds. We determined the
   size and composition of the seed banks in tipper soil layers of plots
   and compared the seed banks to the standing vegetation,
   Results: A total of 12 220 seedlings belonging to 42 species front 20
   families germinated. Total mean seed density (0-5 cm depth) was low in
   all plots within forest, grassland, and heavily degraded vegetation
   types (34.7 +/- 8.6 to 693.5 +/- 123.6. 58.6 +/- 7.8 to 107.1 +/- 10.0,
   and 1,1 +/- 0.5 to 7.2 +/- 2.3 seeds/m(2), respectively). Forbs and
   graminoids dominated the seed banks of grassland and forest plots
   including Cyperus brevifolius, Gnaphalium pensylvanicum, Oxalis
   corniculata and Solanum nigrum, and these alien species comprised 90\%
   of the density of the seed bank. There was little correlation between
   seed banks and standing vegetation of the island (Sorensen similarity
   coefficient values 0.26 to 0.45).
   Conclusions: If natural regeneration occurs from the seed bank of the
   island, future vegetation will not move toward the original forest
   community, because the seed bank is dominated by non-native herbaceous
   grassland species. Though isolated, a few forest remnants with low
   species richness could be an important source for the natural
   re-establishment of forest on the island; however, seed availability may
   be limited by either poor dispersal or pollination so that woody species
   will probably recover very slowly on this goat-impacted island.}},

Abstract = {{Question: We asked how landscape configuration and present management
   influence plant species richness and abundance of habitat specialists in
   grasslands in a `modern' (much exploited and transformed) agricultural
   Swedish landscape.
   Location: Selaon, south-eastern Sweden (59 degrees 24' N, 17 degrees 10'
   E).
   Methods: Present and past ( 150 and 50 years ago) landscape pattern was
   analysed in a 25 km(2) area. Species richness was investigated in 63
   different grassland patches; grazed and abandoned semi-natural
   grasslands. and razed ex-arable fields. Influence of landscape
   variables; area, past and present grassland connectivity. present
   management on total species richness. density and abundance of 25
   grassland specialists was analysed.
   Results: Semi-natural grasslands (permanent unfertilised pastures or
   meadows formed by traditional agricultural methods) had declined from
   60\% 150 years ago to 5\% today. There was a significant decline in
   species richness and density in abandoned serni-natUral grasslands.
   Total species richness was influenced by present management. size and
   connectivity to present and past grassland pattern. Landscape variables
   did not influence species density in grazed semi-natural grassland
   Suggesting that maintained grazing management makes grassland patches
   independent of landscape context. The abundance of 16 grassland
   specialists was Mainly influenced by management and to some extent also
   by landscape variables.
   Conclusion: Although species richness pattern reflect management and to
   some extent landscape variables, the response of individual species may
   be idiosyncratic. The historical signal from past landscapes is weak on
   present-day species richness in highly transformed, agricultural
   landscapes. Generalizations of historical legacies on species diversity
   in grasslands should consider also highly transformed landscapes and not
   only landscapes with a high amount of diversity hotspots left.}},

Abstract = {{Cerrado is a savanna-like region that covers a large area of Brazil.
   Despite its biological importance, the Cerrado has been the focus of few
   microbial diversity studies. A molecular approach was chosen to
   characterize the soil fungal communities in four areas of the Cerrado
   biome: a native Cerrado, a riverbank forest, an area converted to a
   soybean plantation, and an area converted to pasture. Global diversity
   of fungal communities in each area was assessed through Ribosomal
   intergenic spacer analysis which revealed remarkable differences among
   the areas studied. Sequencing of approximately 200 clones containing 18S
   rDNA sequences from each library was performed and, according to the
   genetic distance between sequences, these were assigned to operational
   taxonomic units (OTUs). A total of 75, 85, 85, and 70 OTUs were
   identified for the native Cerrado, riverbank forest, pasture, and
   soybean plantation, respectively. Analysis of sequences using a
   similarity cutoff value of 1\% showed that the number of OTUs for the
   native Cerrado area was reduced by 35\%; for the soybean plantation, a
   reduction by more than 50\% was observed, indicating a reduction in
   fungal biodiversity associated with anthropogenic activity. This is the
   first study demonstrating the anthropogenic impact on Cerrado soil
   fungal diversity.}},

Abstract = {{A closed depression is defined as a geomorphologic element where a
   sediment depository is encircled by hillslopes. Despite the fact that
   closed depressions are often the only stagnant water points in many
   European landscapes, few ecological researches on their plant
   assemblages have been done. The main goal of this study was to give
   first results of the environmental factors responsible for the
   vegetation composition, richness and rarity in the closed depressions of
   the Lorraine biogeographical district (Belgium, France and grand-duche
   de Luxembourg). We surveyed for plant presence 85 forest and 77
   grassland closed depressions. For each site, wetland area, local
   environmental factors and regional connectivities registered. For each
   species, the Ellenberg values were compiled. To investigate the main
   source of variation in species composition and in species richness
   (including richness in rare species), Non-metric Multidimensional
   Scaling analyses and Generalized Linear Models were respectively used.
   Species pools in forest (forest and preforest species) and in grassland
   (bog plants, pioneers, helophytes) were quite different. In both
   landscapes, a gradient from plants typical of basic high-productive
   soils to plants typical of acid low-productive soils reflects a shared
   successional gradient. The accumulation of organic matter allowed the
   establishment of Sphagnum spp., which slowly acidified the soil and thus
   acted as ecosystem engineers for the arrival of bog plants. Moreover,
   the species composition was additionally driven by the plant light
   tolerance in forests and by the plant water requirements in grasslands.
   Mechanisms of species accumulation (increase in species richness) were
   different in forests and in grasslands: respectively related to the
   plant light tolerance and to the wetland area. At the regional level,
   the averaged soil productivity was negatively related to the richness in
   rare species. Indeed, perennial highly-competitive plants such as
   Glyceria spp., Iris pseudacorus or Urtica dioica impeded the
   establishment of smaller and rarer species. At the habitat level,
   isolated closed depressions (due to either low connectivity or low
   grazing pressure) have more habitat rare species, giving evidences of
   dispersal limitation in plant assemblages of closed depressions.}},

Abstract = {{The use of riparian buffer strips as a means of reducing diffuse
   pollution in European grassland systems is becoming more common and
   consequently there is a need for comprehensive research on the influence
   of buffer strip management, placement and structure on biodiversity.
   Carabid assemblages were examined in a range of riparian zones in
   intensively managed grassland in Scotland. Carabids were monitored by
   pitfall trapping in riparian zones open to grazing, wide riparian buffer
   strips (> 5 m wide), narrow boundary strips (< 2 m wide) and adjacent
   fields in order to determine factors influencing carabid diversity and
   assemblage structure. While carabid diversity was greater in open
   riparian zones and narrow boundary strips when compared to the adjacent
   fields, it was actually poorer in wide riparian buffers when compared to
   open zones thus indicating wide buffers may actually be detrimental to
   carabid diversity. Carabid assemblages in wide riparian buffers were,
   however, more distinct from the adjacent field than narrow boundary
   strips or riparian zones open to grazing. Consequently, while the
   presence of wide riparian buffers may not promote carabid diversity
   within the actual buffer strips, by adding an additional habitat that
   supports a distinct carabid assemblage, riparian buffer strips may
   promote diversity at the landscape level. Carabid assemblage structure
   was driven by a combination of soil and vegetation characteristics in
   addition to physical attributes including distance from the watercourse
   and width of the strip. Only when we have a better understanding of the
   factors influencing biodiversity within riparian buffer strips can we
   start to formulate effective management prescriptions that fuse their
   dual function of pollution mitigation and biodiversity promotion.}},

Abstract = {{Although agriculture is pointed to as being one of the major causes of
   biodiversity loss, it is now recognised that some farming practices,
   grazing in particular, represent central issues in the on-running debate
   on wildlife conservation. This paper analyses the relationship between
   agricultural pasture management and bird preservation, by focusing on
   the illustrative case study of breeding waders in wet grasslands. After
   a brief account of the knowledge on research investigating the effect of
   grazing management on wader distribution or abundance, we reviewed (i)
   sward structure (i.e. mean sward height and frequency of tussocks)
   requirements, and (ii) breeding phenologies of five wader species
   commonly associated with wet grasslands for nesting in Europe. We found
   differences between species in these two aspects of their biology.
   Investigating grassland management thus underlines that the question of
   the timing of grazing should be considered. Moreover, the fragmented
   characteristic of agricultural landscapes (i.e. a mosaic of fields) in
   which waders breed emphasises the spatial nature of this management. We
   examine three spatial scales (i.e. field, set of adjacent fields,
   landscape) relevant to bird biology and influenced by agricultural
   activities. Based on these findings, we analyse which livestock system
   constraints are essential to take into account in order to minimise
   conflicts between livestock production and conservation aims in marshes.
   Finally, we highlight possible directions for future research.}},

Abstract = {{On the Qinghai-Tibet plateau increased livestock numbers have resulted
   in degradation of the grasslands with potential impacts on native
   biodiversity. Concurrently, perceived increases in populations of native
   small mammals such as plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) have led to
   poisoning programs, with uncertain impacts on species such as
   ground-nesting birds. We explored the relationships between the local
   seasonal abundance of small birds and (1) the density of pika burrows;
   (2) livestock grazing practices; and (3) local poisoning of pikas.
   Around Naqu prefecture, central Tibet, we used a nested experimental
   design to collect data from areas rested from grazing over summer,
   nearby areas with year-round grazing and areas subjected to pika
   poisoning. Additional data were collected from a site where grazing had
   not occurred for at least 4 years prior to the study. Poisoning pikas in
   spring had no detectable effect on the local abundance of birds the
   following autumn. However, two ground-nesting species, white-rumped and
   rufous-necked snowfinches, showed positive associations with the density
   of pika burrows, indicating that long-term `pika poisoning could reduce
   the density of these species by reducing the density of pika burrows.
   Rufous-necked snowfinches and non ground-nesting species including
   horned larks and common hoopoes showed positive responses to reduced
   grazing pressure from livestock, particularly in the long-rested site,
   indicating current grazing levels could be having a negative impact on
   these species. Conservation of small passerine biodiversity in this
   system will require changed management practices for livestock and pikas
   that consider the complex three-way interaction between livestock
   grazing, pikas and small birds. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Declines of West-European farmland biodiversity have been associated
   with intensive agricultural practices, Central and Eastern European
   grasslands still harbour a diverse and unique arthropod community.
   However, our understanding of the effects of farmland management both at
   local and landscape levels is rather limited there. A paired field
   approach was used to compare extensively (0.5 cows/ha) and intensively
   (> 1 cows/ha) grazed pastures in 42 fields in three distinct
   biogeographic regions within Hungary. Spiders belonging to the hunting
   and web-building communities were sampled using funnel traps. We found
   no management effect either on richness and abundance or on species
   composition, which shows that both forms of grazing management at the
   intensity levels studied support valuable spider fauna. At the local
   scale plant and litter cover were the two most important variables that
   significantly affected the communities overall, meaning both the hunting
   and to some degree the web-building communities. No significant
   landscape effects were found in the analyses on spider richness and
   abundance, but community structure was affected by two landscape level
   factors (grassland patch density and grassland percentage). We suggest
   that to protect the valuable spider and other fauna of these regions,
   the recently launched national agri-environmental program should be
   further supported and enlarged to maintain and reintroduce the
   traditional grazing management on these semi-natural grasslands. (C)

Abstract = {{An oligotrophic phosphorus (P) limited seagrass ecosystem in Florida Bay
   was experimentally fertilized in a unique way. Perches were installed to
   encourage seabirds to roost and deliver an external source of nutrients
   via defecation. Two treatments were examined: (1) a chronic 23-year
   fertilization and (2) an earlier 28-month fertilization that was
   discontinued when the chronic treatment was initiated. Because of the
   low mobility of P in carbonate sediments, we hypothesized long-term
   changes to ecosystem structure and function in both treatments.
   Structural changes in the chronic treatment included a shift in the
   dominant seagrass species from Thalassia testudinum to Halodule
   wrightii, large increases in epiphytic biomass and sediment
   chlorophyll-a, and a decline in species richness. Functional changes
   included increased benthic metabolism and quantum efficiency. Initial
   changes in the 28-month fertilization were similar, but after 23 years
   of nutrient depuration T. testudinum has reestablished itself as the
   dominant species. However, P remains elevated in the sediment and H.
   wrightii has maintained a presence. Functionally the discontinued
   treatment remains altered. Biomass exceeds that in the chronic treatment
   and indices of productivity, elevated relative to control, are not
   different from the chronic fertilization. Cessation of nutrient loading
   has resulted in a superficial return to the pre-disturbance character of
   the community, but due to the nature of P cycles functional changes
   persist.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies of how global changes and human activities affect
   plant diversity often focus on broad measures of diversity and discuss
   the implications of these changes for ecosystem function. We examined
   how experimental warming and grazing affected species within plant
   groups of direct importance to Tibetan pastoralists: medicinal plants
   used by humans and palatable plants consumed by livestock. Warming
   resulted in species losses from both the medicinal and palatable plant
   groups; however, differential relative vulnerability to warming
   occurred. With respect to the percent of warming-induced species losses,
   the overall plant community lost 27\%, medicinal plants lost 21\%, and
   non-medicinal plants lost 40\% of species. Losses of palatable and
   non-palatable species were similar to losses in the overall plant
   community. The deep-rootedness of medicinal plants resulted in lowered
   sensitivity to warming, whereas the shallow-rootedness of non-medicinal
   plants resulted in greater sensitivity to warming; the variable rooting
   depth of palatable and non-palatable plants resulted in an intermediate
   response to warming. Predicting the vulnerability of plant groups to
   human activities can be enhanced by knowledge of plant traits, their
   response to specific drivers, and their distribution within plant
   groups. Knowledge of the mechanisms through which a driver operates, and
   the evolutionary interaction of plants with that driver, will aid
   predictions. Future steps to protect ecosystem services furnished by
   medicinal and palatable plants will be required under the novel stress
   of a warmer climate. Grazing may be an important tool in maintaining
   some of these services under future warming.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{151-160}},

Abstract = {{1. Livestock grazing is the most important direct management impact on
   grasslands in upland areas of the UK. For phytophagous species, such as
   Lepidoptera, the impact is primarily through grazing altering the
   species composition and structure of the vegetation. However, specific
   impacts related to different grazing regimes are not well understood for
   this group of insects.
   2. Within a replicated controlled grazing experiment, nocturnal adult
   moths were sampled by light trapping in the fifth year after
   establishment. Sampling effort was standardised between the four grazing
   treatments by simultaneously using identical traps in each treatment.
   3. The highest-intensity grazing treatment produced the lowest moth
   abundance and species richness. Ungrazed and low-intensity sheep grazing
   treatments produced the highest moth abundance and species richness.
   4. Moths that feed exclusively on graminoids and moths that overwinter
   as larvae were disproportionately well represented in the ungrazed
   treatment.
   5. A sub-set of species for which large declines have recently been
   documented in the UK were most abundant in the ungrazed treatment.
   However, they made up the largest proportion of the overall assemblage
   in the high-intensity grazing treatment.
   6. Increased grazing inversely affects moth abundance and species
   richness. However, effects are not even across all moth species. An
   absence of grazing is likely to negatively affect the abundance of some
   moths, especially those that overwinter in the egg stage.}},

   godwit Limosa limosa on farmland}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1067-1075}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Like many farmland birds, the largest European population of the
   black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa, in The Netherlands, has been
   declining for decades despite conservation measures including
   agri-environment schemes (AES). In a new experimental AES aiming to
   reverse this decline, collectives of farmers implemented spatially
   coordinated site-level habitat management ('mosaic management')
   including delayed and staggered mowing of fields, refuge strips and
   active nest protection.
   2. We evaluated the effectiveness of mosaic management by measuring
   godwit breeding success in six experimental sites and paired controls.
   Productivity was higher in mosaics than in controls due to fewer
   agricultural nest losses. Chick fledging success was poor in both
   treatments. Productivity compensated for adult mortality in only one AES
   site.
   3. Although creating chick habitat was a major management goal, the
   availability of tall grass during the fledging period did not differ
   between treatments, mainly because rainfall delayed mowing in all sites
   and study years. However, chick survival increased with the availability
   of tall grass among sites. Higher chick survival will thus enhance the
   positive effect of mosaic management in drier years, but sensitivity to
   weather represents a weakness of the AES design.
   4. Available estimates of productivity in Dutch godwits suggest a strong
   reduction over the past 20 years and implicate chick survival as the
   main driver of their decline. Earlier mowing of grassland is the main
   causal mechanism, but changes in vegetation structure and composition,
   and increased predation may also have contributed.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Demographic rates like breeding success
   are useful parameters for evaluating effects of management. Mosaic
   management increases the productivity of black-tailed godwits, but does
   not ensure long-term population viability for this flagship species of
   wet grassland bird communities. More stringent management prescriptions
   need to improve both the area and the quality (vegetation structure) of
   grassland mown late. Management efforts should be concentrated in areas
   with favourable pre-conditions in order to improve overall
   effectiveness.}},

Title = {{Plant responses to agricultural intensification}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1274-1283}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. A large proportion of the world's land surface is extensively managed
   for livestock production. In areas where livestock systems are becoming
   more intensive, a major challenge is to predict those plant species
   likely to decline, persist or increase as a result of agricultural
   intensification.
   2. Most analyses develop inferences for frequent or abundant species, or
   rely on intensive studies of single species. A promising approach is to
   identify plant traits related to disturbance to enable inference to be
   made about changes in plant community composition. We used a Bayesian
   hierarchical model to analyse the response to agricultural
   intensification of 494 plant species of pastures and woodlands in
   southern Australia, and to identify how simple species' traits (life
   form, growth form and species origin) influence those responses.
   3. The probability of occurrence of most species declined along the two
   intensification gradients, grazing intensity and soil phosphorous
   concentration, although the occurrence of a greater proportion of
   species was negatively correlated with soil phosphorous. Responses could
   be broadly predicted from both plant origin and plant traits, in
   particular growth form.
   4. Native perennial geophytes, ferns and shrubs were most negatively
   affected by both gradients, while exotic annual grasses and forbs were
   more tolerant. Along the phosphorous gradient, 24 of the 30 most
   negatively affected plant species were native geophytes. Mean
   within-group responses masked considerable within- and between-species
   variation, particularly for the exotic species group which included
   species that responded both negatively and positively to
   intensification.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The hierarchical model described here
   provides a powerful method for estimating individual plant responses and
   identifying how species' traits influence those responses. Plant species
   native to southern Australia are sensitive to grazing and phosphorous
   apparently due to a shared evolutionary history of low grazing intensity
   and low phosphorous soils. Invading exotic plants have faced strongly
   contrasting ecological filters, leading to a greater diversity of
   responses. Where grazing systems have been most intense, a small suite
   of exotics dominate. Maintaining native and functional plant diversity
   will necessitate limits being placed on intensive livestock management
   systems.}},

   mortality fluctuate with season and weather?
   Location: Negrentino, southern Alps, Switzerland.
   Methods: Fecundity estimates of the dominant grass Bromus erectus;
   highly frequent counts of spontaneous seedlings by species and
   calculation of a community- level average mortality rate across 5 years;
   species- level records of seed shedding date and measurements of seed
   mass; measurement of soil moisture.
   Results: B. erectus produced 143.9 viable seeds/ m(2)/ year while the
   density of its seedlings was a 55 times smaller fraction. Grasses had
   fewer seedlings than forbs and their phenology of seed shedding was less
   compatible with mowing date. Soil moisture was a strong determinant of
   seedling emergence in spring and less so in autumn. Average seedling
   mortality declined with age of the populations and reached a maximum in
   an extremely dry summer. In relatively wet summers establishment success
   was positively related to seed mass.
   Conclusion: Community structure is susceptible to drought through
   mechanisms that selectively reduce recruits of coexisting plant
   functional groups. We propose that ( 1) more frequent intense droughts
   tend to reduce species that depend on frequent recruitment from seed,
   hence favour long-lived clonally spreading species, ( 2) drought timing
   selects between species with different germination phenology and drought
   resistance, and ( 3) drought impacts can be mitigated by changing
   management regimes that affect seed shedding.}},

Abstract = {{Plant litter may play an important role in herbaceous plant communities
   by limiting primary production and influencing plant species richness.
   However, it is not known how the effect of litter interacts with
   fertilization. We tested for the role of litter and fertilization in a
   large-scale experiment to investigate effects on diversity and biomass
   of plant species, growth forms, native vs. non-native groups, and
   abiotic ecosystem components (e.g., soil moisture, PAR). We manipulated
   plant litter (removed vs. left in situ) and nutrient availability
   (NPK-fertilized vs. unfertilized) for 4 years in 314-m(2) plots,
   replicated six times, in an old-field grassland. While many of our
   species-level results supported previously published studies and theory,
   our plant group results generally did not. Specifically, grass species
   richness and forb biomass was not affected by either fertilization or
   plant litter. Moreover, plant litter removal significantly increased
   non-native plant species richness. Relative to native plant species, all
   of our experimental manipulations significantly increased both the
   biomass and the species richness of non-native plant species. Thus, this
   grassland system was sensitive to management treatments through the
   facilitation of non-native plant species. We coupled biotic and abiotic
   components within a nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analysis to
   investigate treatment effects, which revealed that specific treatments
   altered ecosystem development. These results suggest that fertilization
   and plant litter may have larger impacts on plant communities and on
   ecosystem properties than previously understood, underscoring the need
   for larger-scale and longer-term experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Ranches are being converted to exurban housing developments in the
   southwestern United States, with potentially signi. cant but little-
   studied impacts on biological diversity. We counted birds in grasslands
   and savannas in southeastern Arizona that were grazed by livestock,
   embedded in low- density exurban housing developments, or both, or
   neither. Species richness and bird abundance were higher in exurban
   neighborhoods than in undeveloped landscapes, independent of livestock
   grazing. The positive response to development was particularly evident
   among doves, quail, hummingbirds, aerial insectivores, and some but not
   all ground- foraging sparrows. Effects of livestock grazing were
   comparatively minor and mostly involved birds with requirements for tall
   ground cover or the lack of it. The average rank correlation between
   counts of individual species and housing density was positive across all
   transects. However, this relationship disappeared among the exurban
   transects alone, and bird species richness on the exurban transects was
   negatively correlated with the number of homes nearby. These results
   suggest that the positive in. uence of exurban development on avian
   abundance and variety was greatest at the lowest housing densities. We
   attribute the attraction of many birds to exurban development to an
   oasis effect, in which resources otherwise scarce in arid southwestern
   environments ( shade, nectar, nest sites, and especially water) are
   relatively abundant around exurban home sites. This. nding is consistent
   with the hypothesis that exurban home sites represented resource supply
   points inside birds' home ranges otherwise consisting mostly of natural
   vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how the high small-scale species richness of an alpine
   meadow on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, is maintained. This area is
   characterized by strong wind and severe cold during long winters. In
   winter, most livestock is grazed on dead leaves in small pastures near
   farmers' residences, whereas in the short summer, livestock is grazed in
   mountainous areas far from farmers' residences. The number of plant
   species and the aboveground biomass were surveyed for three adjacent
   pastures differing in grazing management: a late-winter grazing pasture
   grazed moderately from 1 February to 30 April, an early-winter grazing
   pasture grazed lightly from 20 September to late October, and a
   whole-year grazing pasture grazed intensively throughout the entire
   year. In each pasture, we harvested the aboveground biomass from 80 or
   100 quadrats of 0.01 m(2) along a transect and classified the contents
   by species. We observed 15.5-19.7 species per 0.01 m(2), which is high
   richness per 0.01 m(2) on a worldwide scale. The species richness in the
   two winter grazing pastures was higher than that in the whole-year
   grazing pasture. The spatial variation in species richness and species
   composition in the two winter grazing pastures in which species richness
   was high was greater than that in the whole-year grazing pasture in
   which species richness was lower. Most of the leaves that are preserved
   on the winter grazing pastures during summer are blown away by strong
   winds during winter, and the remaining leaves are completely exhausted
   in winter by livestock grazing. A pasture with a high richess is
   accompanied by a high spatial variation in species richness and species
   composition. There is a high possibility that the characteristic of
   spatial variation is also caused by traditional grazing practices in
   this area.}},

Abstract = {{Medusahead is among the most invasive grasses in the western United
   States. Selective control of this noxious winter annual grass is
   difficult in California grasslands, as many other desirable annual
   grasses and both native and nonnative broadleaf forbs are also important
   components of the rangeland system. Intensive grazing management using
   sheep is one control option. This study was designed to determine the
   optimal timing for sheep grazing on heavily infested medusahead sites,
   and to evaluate the changes in species composition with different
   grazing regimes. Midspring (April/May) grazing reduced medusahead cover
   by 86 to 100\% relative to ungrazed plots, regardless of whether it was
   used in combination with early spring or fall grazing. Early spring
   (March) or fall (October to November) grazing, alone or in combination,
   was ineffective for control of medusahead. In addition, midspring
   grazing increased forb cover, native forb species richness, and overall
   plant diversity. At the midspring grazing timing, medusahead was in the
   ``boot{''} stage, just prior to exposure of the inflorescences. The
   success of this timely grazing system required high animal densities for
   short periods. Although this approach may be effective in some areas,
   the timing window is fairly narrow and the animal stocking rates are
   high. Thus, sheep grazing is unlikely to be a practical solution for
   management of large medusahead infestations.}},

Abstract = {{Animals that modify their environment through engineering and herbivory
   have important impacts on ecosystems, yet the interactive roles of such
   species have rarely been studied. We studied the comparative and
   interactive effects of two burrowing herbivorous rodents, Gunnison's
   prairie dogs (Cynomys gunnisoni) and banner-tailed kangaroo rats
   (Dipodomys spectabilis), on vegetation where they co-occurred in a
   Chihuahuan Desert grassland. We found that their effects remained
   distinct and, thus, non-substitutable, where they co-occurred. The
   rodents differentially altered plant community structure relative to
   their different mound types, herbivory, and spatial scales of
   disturbance. Vegetation structure and plant species assemblages differed
   between mound and landscape patches occupied by prairie dogs and
   kangaroo rats. Where both species co-occurred, there was more soil
   disturbance, organic material from-their fecal pellets, forb cover, and
   activity by other animals. The combined effect of these rodents
   increased the landscape heterogeneity and plant species richness by
   creating a mosaic of different habitat patches on the landscape. Our
   results demonstrate that these rodents had complementary, additive
   effects where they co-occurred, and suggest that multiple
   habitat-modifying species, especially those that play large ecological
   roles, can have important interactive effects on community structure and

Abstract = {{Woody plant invasions, either of alien or indigenous species. are deemed
   to result in loss of ecosystem goods and services in many areas
   throughout the world, resulting in significant degradation and economic
   costs. Invasion of Euryops floribundus, a species indigenous to South
   Africa, is perceived to have reduced the grazing available for domestic
   livestock. Consequently, a programme of manual eradication has been
   implemented to improve I he grazing resource and provide jobs for
   poverty alleviation. However. there is potential for a conflict of
   interest as our study shows that almost all households rely on Euryops
   for fuel and at times fencing material, whereas only a minority of
   households own livestock. Moreover. comparison of invaded and
   non-invaded sites indicated that the invaded sites harbour greater plant
   species richness and higher grass culm density per unit area of grass
   cover, as well as higher forb and litter cover. While invaded sites had
   lower grass cover, overall plant cover was no different between invaded
   and non-invaded sites. Multivariate analysis indicated no obvious
   differentiation in community composition between invaded and non-invaded
   areas, suggesting stronger drivers of community composition other than
   Euryops invasion presumed to be facilitated by the effects of high
   livestock densities. Overall. Our study suggests that the clearing
   operation may well benefit from a better understanding of the social
   needs, perceptions of degradation by the various stakeholders and
   ecological dynamics of the area, especially local reliance on the
   resources, and the dynamics of the invasion, particularly its extent,
   rate of spread and Susceptibility for re-invasion in the cleared areas.

Abstract = {{In the Midwestern United States, more than 99.99\% of pre-settlement oak
   (Quercus) savanna has been lost due to agriculture and fire suppression.
   Thus, the restoration of this ecosystem is imperative to secure the
   biodiversity, which depends on oak savanna. In this study, we
   characterized factors affecting the host-plant quality and nectar use of
   the endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis
   Nabokov) in Ohio. Past research has shown butterfly abundance to be
   correlated with host-plant quantity, habitat area, and nectar plant
   abundance. However, there is growing recognition that host-plant quality
   is important at small spatial scales. We measured host-plant quality by
   quantifying leaf nitrogen content for the first larval brood and a PCA
   analysis of nitrogen and water content for the second larval brood.
   Additionally, observations quantified adult female foraging rates. Our
   results for the first brood larval stage found no significant difference
   in leaf nitrogen between burned, mowed, and unmanaged treatments. We
   used Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) to determine that host-plant
   quality for the second brood was primarily explained by herbaceous
   vegetation density followed by canopy cover and aspect. Greater
   herbaceous vegetation density, greater canopy cover, and flat/north
   aspects were associated with higher quality host-plants. Lower
   host-plant nitrogen for the second brood was accompanied by a greater
   adult foraging rate. Management of Kamer blue habitats should include
   restoring areas with a compatible herbaceous structure and increasing
   historically abundant forbs, which provide nectar to second brood Kamer
   blues. This ecosystem-based management should positively impact many
   species in this rare oak savanna community.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivores influence spatial heterogeneity in soil resources and
   vegetation in ecosystems. Despite increasing recognition that spatial
   heterogeneity can drive species richness at different spatial scales,
   few studies have quantified the effect of grazing on spatial
   heterogeneity and species richness simultaneously. Here we document both
   these variables in a rabbit-grazed grassland. We measured mean values
   and spatial patterns of grazing intensity, rabbit droppings, plant
   height, plant biomass, soil water content, ammonia and nitrate in sites
   grazed by rabbits and in matched, ungrazed exclosures in a grassland in
   southern England. Plant species richness was recorded at spatial scales
   ranging between 0.0001 and 150 m(2). Grazing reduced plant height and
   plant biomass but increased levels of ammonia and nitrate in the soil.
   Spatial statistics revealed that rabbit-grazed sites consisted of a
   mixture of heavily grazed patches with low vegetation and nutrient-rich
   soils (lawns) surrounded by patches of high vegetation with
   nutrient-poor soils (tussocks). The mean patch size (range) in the
   grazed controls was 2.1 +/- 0.3 m for vegetation height, 3.8 +/- 1.8 m
   for soil water content and 2.8 +/- 0.9 m for ammonia. This is in line
   with the patch sizes of grazing (2.4 +/- 0.5 m) and dropping deposition
   (3.7 +/- 0.6 m) by rabbits. In contrast, patchiness in the ungrazed
   exclosures had a larger patch size and was not present for all
   variables. Rabbit grazing increased plant species richness at all
   spatial scales. Species richness was negatively correlated with plant
   height, but positively correlated to the coefficient of variation of
   plant height at all plot sizes. Species richness in large plots (< 25
   m(2)) was also correlated to patch size. This study indicates that the
   abundance of strong competitors and the nutrient availability in the
   soil, as well as the heterogeneity and spatial pattern of these factors
   may influence species richness, but the importance of these factors can
   differ across spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{Seed limitation may prevent successful restoration of native plant
   communities. Seed addition is a common restoration practice but the role
   of small mammals in affecting seedling recruitment is not well
   understood. The purpose of this investigation was to test the relative
   effect of seed introduction in combination with small mammal and bird
   exclosurcs in an Ohio wet meadow. We ask whether the ambient population
   of Microtus pennsylvanicus (1) alters species composition (e.g.
   forb/grass/sedge, invasive, non-native); (2) influences plant diversity;
   and (3) reduces the effect of increasing local plant richness through
   seed introductions. We established a 2 x 2 factorial design including a
   seed addition treatment (0 and 20 seed species added) and an exclosure
   treatment (open and fenced to exclude all mammalian and bird herbivores
   and granivores). Seeds from twenty native species were selected to
   represent a broad range of plant life forms typically found in temperate
   eastern North American wet meadow communities. All species were obligate
   or facultative wetland species with forbs, grasses and sedges
   represented. We found that forb species increased inside exclosures,
   especially ill the seed addition treatment. We also found that relative
   biomass of invasive species was reduced in exclosures and with seed
   addition. Species richness increased with seed addition; however,
   exclosures significantly increased species richness and diversity,
   particularly of those species that were experimentally introduced by,
   seed. Our results Support the seed limitation hypotheses. It is also
   evident that seed and seedling predation are important factors that can
   control wet meadow community composition and diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Seed dispersal via ingestion and defecation by large herbivores
   (endozoochory) plays a potentially important role in structuring plant
   communities. In the present study we tested whether cattle disperse
   seeds between different plant communities in a heterogeneous coastal
   habitat. We surveyed the seed contents of cattle dung collected from two
   habitat types within a grazing system, one in dunes and the other in
   salt-marsh. The dunes are characterized by sandy soil, and infrequent
   inundation by the sea, whereas the salt-marsh features clay deposited
   during inundations. Seeds of both salt-marsh and dune species were
   dispersed into salt-marsh and dune habitats. The seed content of cattle
   dung collected in salt-marsh and dunes was similar with respect to
   species composition and seed density. However, dispersal of dune species
   into salt-marsh and vice-versa did not result in establishment in those
   communities. Seed traits per se did not differ between dune species and
   salt-marsh species. Species abundance in the established vegetation and
   seed density in dung were positively correlated. Seed abundance for most
   species found in dung was consistent with the availability of viable
   seeds during the growing season. Seed mass, seed `roundness' and seed
   release height were all negatively correlated with seed numbers in dung.
   An indirect factor, namely, forage quality of the plant, and hence
   attractiveness for herbivores, could explain the higher likelihood of
   seed dispersal of salt-marsh species than of dune species. The
   salt-marsh harbours species with higher forage quality than the dune
   species, as derived from Ellenberg nitrogen indicator values.}},

Abstract = {{Elymus repens (L.) Gould and Agrostis stolonifera (L.), are competitive
   grasses with guerrilla strategy that invade grasslands with a low
   stocking rate. In this work, we tested the hypotheses that grazing
   exclusion facilitates vegetative development of rhizomes and stolons of
   these clonal grasses and that such change is a key mechanism for their
   abundance in set-aside grasslands. The competitive capacities of these
   two guerrilla species were characterised by samples in plant community
   (species richness and biomass) and on the level of individual species
   (morphometric measurements on stolons and rhizomes) during a growing
   season. Compared to grasslands where grazing was excluded for three
   years, species richness was higher in grazed site and the plant
   community structure differed. Indeed, with grazing exclusion, a shift
   from annual species with a diversified growth-form to perennial species
   with a tall tussock and graminoid growth-form was monitored. In ungrazed
   situation, Elymus repens and Agrostis stolonifera were the dominant
   grasses, and the standing biomass for the lowland community showed a
   significant increase compared to the grazed site. Vegetative development
   increased competitive capacities of these two guerrilla species and led
   by phenomenon of competitive exclusion to the disappearance of annuals
   species. With grazing cessation, Elymus repens was found to increase the
   size of aerial traits (shoot length and the number of leaves per shoot)
   and this may both be propitious for achieving dominance within plant
   communities and also maintaining its competitive local advantage. By
   contrast, Agrostis stolonifera showed an increase in a root trait, i.e.
   rhizome length, in the fenced site, which provide good ability for
   spatial propagation and then to explore adjacent patches. We concluded
   that Elymus repens presented a morphological capacity to change its
   colonising strategy from a guerrilla strategy to a phalanx strategy, by
   morphological variability of aerial organs, when it was submitted to
   competitive stress and environment modifications. Agrostis stolonifera
   showed a capacity to escape aerial competition resulting from grazing
   cessation, than to increase underground propagation capacity. The
   present study highlighted the capacities of Elymus repens to respond in
   an adaptative way to competitive pressure.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we outline the development of a spatial microsimulation
   model that uses a combinational optimisation technique called simulated
   annealing to match the Irish Census of Agriculture data to a National
   Farm Survey (NFS). The matched NFS and Census information is then used
   to produce small area farm population microdata estimates of the
   probability of participation by Irish farmers in the Rural Environmental
   Protection Scheme (REPS) for the year 2005. Previous studies that have
   examined the participation of farmers in agri-environmental schemes
   across Europe have been unable to quantify the type of habitats being
   protected under the programmes. This is rectified in this paper by
   combining the simulated farm population microdata with habitat land
   cover data within a GIS framework to examine what types of habitats are
   actually being protected under the agri-environmental programme. The
   results indicate that wetgrassland, bogland, rocky complexes, forestry
   and shallow water are habitats that are more likely to be given
   protection under the REPS programme while heath, dry grassland, built
   land and cut fen are habitat types that are unlikely to be protected

Abstract = {{After abandonment, dry grassland (Festuco-Brometea) areas decline due to
   gradual overgrowing by woody species and the expansion of perennial tall
   grass species. Dry grassland vegetation was formed by extensive
   livestock grazing, thus grazing is considered one of the most natural
   methods for managing this type of vegetation. Six years after
   introducing low-intensity sheep and goat grazing in seven nature
   reserves in Prague (Czech Republic), the following impact of this
   management on dry grassland vegetation was observed: The cover of
   expansive woody species, particularly Ligustrum vulgare, and to a
   smaller extent Cornus sanguinea and Prunus spinosa declined. In
   addition, a significant, long-term declining trend of the expansive
   species Arrhenatherum elatius was also observed. Also the cover of
   Pimpinella saxifraga and Allium senescens declined significantly with
   regard to statistical evaluation. On the contrary, the cover of Achillea
   millefolium, Centaurea stoebe, Securigera varia, Elytrigia repens,
   Erysimum crepidifolium, Falcaria vulgaris, Fallopia convolvulus and
   Verbascum lychnitis increased. The cover of species characteristic of
   dry grasslands (Festuco-Brometea) increased significantly. No changes
   were observed in the number and cover of the Red List species. In
   addition, the presence of nitrophilous and ruderal species increased.
   Species diversity also significantly increased. From our findings we can
   conclude that managing dry grasslands with low-intensity grazing can
   help to keep dry grassland vegetation in good condition and conserve its

Abstract = {{The conversion of native habitats to pasture and other working lands,
   unbuilt lands modified by humans for production, is one of the greatest
   threats to biodiversity. While some human-dominated landscapes on
   continents support relatively high native biodiversity, this capacity is
   little studied in oceanic island systems characterized by high endemism
   and vulnerability to invasion. Using Hawaii as a case study, we assessed
   the conservation value of working landscapes on an oceanic island by
   surveying native and non-native plant diversity in mature native forest
   and in the three dominant land covers/uses to which it has been
   converted: native, Acacia koa timber plantations, wooded pasture, and
   open pasture. As expected, native plant diversity (richness and
   abundance) was significantly higher and non-native abundance
   significantly lower in mature native forests than any other site type.
   A. koa plantations and wooded pasture supported four and three times
   greater, respectively, species richness of native understory plants than
   open pasture. Also, A. koa plantations and wooded pasture supported
   similar species communities with about 75\% species in common.
   Conservation and restoration of mature native forest in Hawaii is
   essential for the protection of native, rare species and limiting the
   spread of non-native species. A. koa plantations and wooded pasture,
   however, may help harmonize production and conservation by supporting
   livelihoods, more biodiversity than open pasture, and some connectivity
   between native forest remnants important for sustaining landscape-level
   conservation value into the future.}},

Abstract = {{In nature management, the introduction of large herbivores into
   human-influenced grasslands is thought to be effective to maintain or
   enhance plant diversity. In order to test the validity of this
   assumption, we studied the effectof grazingby large herbivores on plant
   species richness and community heterogeneity across a soil acidity
   gradient at different spatial scales in dry coastal dune grasslands in
   western Belgium and north-westem France. The effect of grazing on plant
   richness varied with scale and soil acidity. Grazing had a predominantly
   positive effect on plant species richness in all habitats at the small
   scale (0.25 x 0.25 m). However, at site scale (8 x 8 m) it had only
   positive effects in grasslands with higher soil pH (6-7.4). Similarly,
   grazing resulted in a homogenization of grassland vegetation at lower
   pH, while heterogeneity increased with grazing on soil with higher pH.
   In general, grazing increased the number of rare species, independent of
   soil pH. The results confirm that the impact of grazing on plant
   diversity depends on the scale considered and that the effects further
   depend on soil acidity which was correlated to biomass production at the
   given soil pH range in this study. Although grazing seems an appropriate
   management tool to maintain and even enhance plant biodiversity under
   many circumstances, it may negatively affect plant species richness,
   where soil resources limit plant biomass production. (c) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although the effects of nutrient enhancement on aquatic systems are well
   documented, the consequences of nutritional supplements on soil food
   webs are poorly understood, and results of past research examining
   bottom-up effects are often conflicting. In addition, many studies have
   failed to separate the effects of nutrient enrichment and the physical
   effects of adding organic matter. In this field study, we hypothesised
   that the addition of nitrogen to soil would result in a trophic cascade,
   through detritivores (Collembola) to predators (spiders), increasing
   invertebrate numbers and diversity.
   Nitrogen and lime were added to plots in an upland grassland in a
   randomised block design. Populations of Collembola and spiders were
   sampled by means of pitfall traps and identified to species.
   Seventeen species of Collembola were identified from the nitrogen plus
   lime (N + L) and control plots. Species assemblage, diversity, richness,
   evenness and total number were not affected by nutrient additions.
   However, there was an increase in the number of Isotomidae juveniles and
   Parisotoma anglicana trapped in the N + L plots.
   Of the 44 spider species identified, over 80\% were Linyphiidae. An
   effect on species assemblage from the addition of N + L to the plots was
   observed on two of the four sampling dates (July 2002 and June 2003).
   The linyphiid, Oedothorax retusus, was the only species significantly
   affected by the treatments and was more likely to be trapped in the
   control plots.
   The increased number of juvenile Collembola, and change in community
   composition of spiders, were consequences of the bottom-up effect caused
   by nutrient inputs. However, despite efforts to eliminate the indirect
   effects of nutrient inputs, a reduction in soil moisture in the N + L
   plots cannot be eliminated as a cause of the invertebrate population
   changes observed. Even so, this experiment was not confounded by the
   physical effects of habitat structure reported in most previous studies.
   It provides evidence of moderate bottom-up influences of epigeic soil
   invertebrate food webs and distinguishes between nutrient addition and
   plant physical structure effects. It also emphasises the importance Of
   understanding the effects of soil management practices on soil
   biodiversity, which is under increasing pressure from land development
   and food production.}},

Abstract = {{From April 1995 to November 1997 investigations were carried out in
   orchards in South-West Germany (48 degrees 36'N/9 degrees 23'E): data
   were collected on the type and frequency of grassland use and data on
   the carabid fauna. 17 sample plots were selected. Part of the plots had
   25 years of unchanged management regimes which were three-cutting
   meadows (3), two-cutting meadows (3), mulched meadows (4), abandoned
   meadows (3), a horse pasture, a sheep pasture with rotational grazing, a
   continuously grazed sheep pasture, and a sheep pasture abandoned in
   1994. On nearly all studied plots the relative frequency of dominant
   species changed. 3-cutting meadows frequently show a one-sided activity
   dominance structure. A cluster analysis depending on Wainstein Index
   demonstrates: the carabid communities of plots under succession and
   3-cutting meadows were distinct and hardly similar to other cultivation
   plots. The composition of the carabid communities was less constant on
   the plots compared to the vegetation community.. The communities of
   neighbouring study plots with different management treatment were
   therefore often more similar compared to plots which had the same
   management treatment but were further apart. The management of sub
   growing in orchards and its influence on ground beetle communities is
   briefly discussed.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{17-27}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Physical supporting or defense structures of plants, which decrease
   palatability, remain in plant tissue after a plant's death and so
   decrease detritus decomposition rates. Consequently, palatability and
   detritus decomposition rate are expected to be positively correlated.
   Carbon is the main component of these restricting structures, whereas
   nitrogen is expected to increase plant attractiveness for herbivores. In
   this study, we tried to confirm the expected positive relationship
   between palatability and detritus decomposition rate and to find the
   species functional traits that are responsible for this concordant
   response. Some traits are shared by species as a consequence of their
   common phylogenetic history; consequently, we also studied the effect of
   phylogenetic correction on the expected relationships.
   We assessed the palatability of meadow plant species to a generalist
   slug Arion lusitanicus in an aquarium grazing experiment and detritus
   decomposition rate in a field litter-bag test. The two characteristics
   are positively correlated and the relationship is strengthened by
   phylogenetic correction. The relationship was strongest for the
   decomposition rates during the first three months of exposition, but
   weakened when the exposition period was from six months to a year.
   Palatability was negatively affected by plant carbon content, but no
   relationship was found between plant palatability and nitrogen content.
   Similarly, only the relationship of litter decomposition with litter
   carbon content was significant. The regression tree method was used to
   detect the influence of species traits on species palatability and
   detritus decomposition rate. In general, leaf dry matter content, litter
   carbon content and seed weight were chosen as the best predictors of
   plant palatability response. Results for the detritus decomposition rate
   response mainly reflect supporting or defensive structure contents.
   Litter carbon content, seed weight and plant height are the most
   apparent common predictors of these variable responses.
   In general, our study confirmed the positive relationship between plant
   palatability and detritus decomposition. Both plant tissue grazing and
   detritus decomposition are slowed down by plant tissue supportive
   structures, manifested as high dry matter content or high tissue carbon
   content.}},

Title = {{Differences in gypsum plant communities associated with habitat
   fragmentation and livestock grazing}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{954-964}},

Abstract = {{The negative consequences of habitat fragmentation for plant communities
   have been documented in many regions of the world. In some fragmented
   habitats, livestock grazing has been proposed to be a dispersal
   mechanism reducing isolation between fragments. In others, grazing acts
   together with fragmentation in a way that increases habitat degradation.
   Iberian gypsum plant communities have been grazed and fragmented by
   agricultural practices for centuries. Although their conservation is
   considered a priority by the European Community, the effects of
   fragmentation on gypsum plant communities and the possible role of
   livestock grazing remain unknown. In addition, a substantial proportion
   of plant species growing in gypsum environments are gypsum specialists.
   They could be particularly affected by fragmentation, as was found for
   other habitat specialists (i.e., serpentine and calcareous specialists).
   In this study (1) we investigated the effect of fragmentation and
   grazing on gypsum plant community composition (species and life-forms),
   and (2) we tested to see if gypsum specialists were differently affected
   by fragmentation and grazing than habitat generalists. A vegetation
   survey was conducted in the largest gypsum outcrop of Europe (Middle
   Ebro Valley, northeast Spain). Fragmented and continuous sites in grazed
   and ungrazed areas were compared. Measurements related to species and
   composition of life-forms were contrasted first for the whole gypsum
   plant community and then specifically for the gypsum specialists. In the
   whole community, our results showed lower plant species diversity in
   fragmented sites, mainly due to the larger dominance of species more
   tolerant to fragmented habitat conditions. With livestock grazing, the
   plant species richness and the similarity in plant species composition
   between remnants was larger, suggesting that animals were acting as
   dispersal agents between fragments. As expected, gypsum specialists were
   less abundant in fragmented areas, and grazing led to the disappearance
   of the rare gypsum specialist Campanula fastigiata. According to our
   results, conservation strategies for gypsum plant communities in
   human-dominated landscapes should consider that fragmentation and
   grazing modify plant community composition affecting gypsum specialists
   in particular.}},

Journal = {{FOURRAGES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Number = {{194}},
Pages = {{233-252}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{An easy method for the evaluation of a pasture's floristic diversity was
   developed in Auvergne, making it possible for a non-botanist to assess
   its bio-diversity. The aim was to make people working in the sphere of
   agriculture aware of the floristic diversity of ordinary grasslands. It
   relies on qualitative and quantitative observations made on pasture
   plots where different vegetation facies are distinguished. In our view,
   the floristic diversity of a pasture depends on the swards composition,
   but is also enhanced by the diversity of the landscape; we therefore
   assessed both these factors in our approach. The selection of indicators
   of the bio-diversity was based on the study of 126 vegetation facies,
   evenly distributed over four classes of pastures differing in their type
   of management (grazing or mowing) and in their environment (upland,
   lowland with a rich or a poor soil). We made for each facies both a
   botanical inventory and a simplified description of the vegetation, the
   fauna and the landscape features. To identify indicators, we looked for
   linear correlations between bio-diversity, as calculated from the
   inventories, and the data from the simplified descriptions. Nine
   indicators were found for the assessment of the herbaceous vegetation's
   diversity : total and average number of species with a different
   physiognomy, colours, forms of flowers... and one indicator was based on
   the diversity in butterflies. These indicators can be obtained on the
   field by a simplified counting, inside 10 circles of 1 m diameter for
   the flora, and along a transect for the fauna. They are more or less the
   same for each class, the main difference being in the identification
   thresholds, which are adapted to the Auvergne grasslands. The indicators
   of a given class were gathered in a single grid, in which five levels of
   bio-diversity were diagnosed. In addition to the assessment of each
   facies, we also propose a measure of the differences among the facies of
   the same plot. This point concerns only the number of species of
   different physiognomy. Separate grids were also designed for the
   assessment of the diversity of landscapes, as we did not find any
   correlation between the latter and the diversity of the herbaceous
   vegetation. Two indicators were used : the number and the types of
   landscape elements. The grids have also indication thresholds for each
   class and for the five levels of bio-diversity.
   Finally, various ways of interpreting the results are proposed to the
   users of the method, based on the hypothesis that the diversity depends
   not only on management and environment, but also on the landscapes. The
   way landscape diversity can increase and maintain the floristic
   diversity of grasslands is also emphasized.}},

Title = {{The influence of grazing intensity and landscape composition on the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{763-772}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. The loss of semi-natural grasslands in agro-ecosystems has increased
   the importance of adequate management of remaining grasslands.
   Recommendations for intensive grazing have been debated because the
   effects of different management practices may differ between taxa and
   species. The increased fragmentation of grasslands suggests that the
   influence of management practices should be studied in a landscape
   context.
   2. We studied four groups of flower visitors, many of which are
   pollinators, bees (Apoidea), butterflies (Lepidoptera), hoverflies
   (Syrphidae) and beetles (Coleoptera), in semi-natural grasslands managed
   at three intensity levels in eight areas in central Sweden. Local
   characteristics of the grasslands were recorded and landscape diversity
   was quantified. Vegetation height was correlated with grazing intensity:
   intensive grazing with the shortest vegetation and abandoned grassland
   with the tallest.
   3. The insect groups responded differently to grazing intensity. Species
   richness and abundance differed between management regimes for beetles
   and hoverflies but not for bees and butterflies.
   4. The effects of local habitat and landscape composition on species
   richness, abundance and composition differed between groups. Bee
   diversity responded to both local and landscape factors. Butterflies
   were mainly affected by local vegetation height and linear elements in
   the landscape. More species of hoverflies were recorded in tall
   vegetation and in landscapes with high forest cover. Beetles responded
   only to local environment characteristics.
   5. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate the importance of studying
   different insect groups simultaneously when evaluating habitat and
   landscape qualities for diversity. The results suggest that planning for
   conservation of biodiversity at landscape scales may be better than
   implementing grazing guidelines for individual grasslands. Grazing
   intensity should vary within or between landscapes to preserve
   pollinator diversity. Conservation management to encourage flower

Abstract = {{Herbivory is a major driver of ecosystem functioning in semi-arid
   African savannas, yet its impact on herbaceous biomass dynamics has been
   poorly understood. Using a 72 ha animal exclosure established 3 years
   prior, we measured the distribution of herbaceous biomass and species
   composition in the presence and absence of herbivory in a semi-arid
   savanna toposequence along the Sabie River in Kruger National Park,
   South Africa. We found that, in the presence of large herbivores in the
   reference site, the biomass of herbaceous plant species generally
   increased from the hillcrest to the lower, wetter riparian zone, while
   species richness did not change. However, after only 2 and 3 years of
   herbivore exclusion, the annual maximum biomass in the riparian area
   increased threefold to similar to 600 g m(-2). Simultaneously, plant
   species richness declined by 55\% and 64\% from 10.2 to 9.2 species per
   m(2) in 2004 and 2005, respectively. In the absence of herbivores,
   fast-growing grasses overtopped and shaded out forbs of lower stature,
   resulting in a reduction in the richness of herbaceous species. We
   conclude that large herbivores are essential in reducing herbaceous
   competition and maintaining species diversity and ecosystem functioning
   in African savanna ecosystems, especially in riparian corridors.

Abstract = {{Large domestic and native ungulates have the potential to disperse large
   quantities of seeds throughout the landscape. Many studies have found
   that ungulates are capable of dispersing seeds but few quantify the
   relative importance of ungulate dispersal across the landscape. We
   investigated the potential for cattle, elk, and deer to disperse native
   and exotic plants in two different western North American ecosystems in
   northeast Oregon. We collected fecal samples of cattle, elk and deer
   that had been deposited during the current growing season. In the
   greenhouse we monitored the density and species richness of seedlings
   that germinated from the fecal samples. All three species act as seed
   dispersers for native and exotic plants. Cattle fecal pats had a higher
   species richness and density of exotic grasses germinating compared to
   the other ungulates; elk had a higher species richness and density of
   native and exotic forbs compared to the other ungulates. We then
   projected the number of seeds that each animal could disperse during a
   growing season. We predict that cattle disperse more than an order of
   magnitude more seeds than elk and deer per animal. Cattle, elk and deer
   interact with the landscape in different ways and this can have
   important ramifications for plant communities at local and regional
   scales. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by domestic herbivores is generally recognized as a major
   ecological factor and an important evolutionary force in grasslands.
   Grazing has both extensive and profound effects on individual plants and
   communities. We investigated the response patterns of Polygonum
   viviparum species and the species diversity of an alpine shrub meadow in
   response to long-term livestock grazing by a field manipulative
   experiment controlling livestock numbers on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in
   China. Here, we hypothesize that within a range of grazing pressure,
   grazing can alter relative allocation to different plant parts without
   changing total biomass for some plant species if there is life history
   trade-offs between plant traits. The same type of communities exposed to
   different grazing pressures may only alter relative species' abundances
   or species composition and not vary species diversity because plant
   species differ in resistant capability to herbivory. The results show
   that plant height and biomass of different organs differed among grazing
   treatments but total biomass remained constant. Biomass allocation and
   absolute investments to both reproduction and growth decreased and to
   belowground storage increased with increased grazing pressure,
   indicating the increasing in storage function was attained at a cost of
   reducing reproduction of bulbils and represented an optimal allocation
   and an adaptive response of the species to long-term aboveground damage.
   Moreover, our results showed multiform response types for either species
   groups or single species along the gradient of grazing intensity. Heavy
   grazing caused a 13.2\% increase in species richness. There was
   difference in species composition of about 18\%-20\% among grazing
   treatment. Shannon-Wiener (H') diversity index and species evenness (E)
   index did not differ among grazing treatments. These results support our
   hypothesis.}},

Title = {{Influence of grazing and fire frequency on small-scale plant community
   structure and resource variability in native tallgrass prairie}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{859-866}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In grasslands worldwide, grazing by ungulates and periodic fires are
   important forces affecting resource availability and plant community
   structure. It is not clear, however, whether changes in community
   structure are the direct effects of the disturbance (i.e. fire and
   grazing) or are mediated indirectly through changes in resource
   abundance and availability. In North American tallgrass prairies, fire
   and grazing often have disparate effects on plant resources and plant
   diversity, yet, little is known about the individual and interactive
   effects of fire and grazing on resource variability and how that
   variability relates to heterogeneity in plant community structure,
   particularly at small scales. We conducted a Field study to determine
   the interactive effects of different long-term fire regimes (annual vs
   four-year fire frequency) and grazing by native ungulates (Bos bison) on
   small-scale plant community structure and resource variability (N and
   light) in native tallgrass prairie. Grazing enhanced light and nitrogen
   availability, but did not affect small-scale resource variability. In
   addition, grazing reduced the dominance of C-4 grasses which enhanced
   species richness, diversity and community heterogeneity. In contrast,
   annual fire increased community dominance and reduced species richness
   and diversity, particularly in the absence of grazing, but had no effect
   on community heterogeneity, resource availability and resource
   variability. Variability in the abundance of resources showed no
   relationship with community heterogeneity at the scale measured in this
   study, however we found a relationship between community dominance and
   heterogeneity. Therefore, we conclude that grazing generated small-scale
   community heterogeneity in this mesic grassland by directly affecting
   plant community dominance, rather than indirectly through changes in
   resource variability.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{196}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{163-184}},

Abstract = {{Although free-roaming equids occur on all of the world's continents
   except Antarctica, very few studies (and none in the Great Basin, USA)
   have either investigated their grazing effects on vegetation at more
   than one spatial scale or compared characteristics of areas from which
   grazing has been removed to those of currently grazed areas. We compared
   characteristics of vegetation at 19 sites in nine mountain ranges of the
   western Great Basin; sites were either grazed by feral horses (Equus
   caballus) or had had horses removed for the last 10-14 years. We
   selected horse-occupied and horse-removed sites with similar aspect,
   slope, fire history, grazing pressure by cattle (minimal to none), and
   dominant vegetation (Artemisia tridentata). During 1997 and 1998,
   line-intercept transects randomly located within sites revealed that
   horse-removed sites exhibited 1.1-1.9 times greater shrub cover, 1.2-1.5
   times greater total plant cover, 2-12 species greater plant species
   richness, and 1.9-2.9 times greater cover and 1.1-2.4 times greater
   frequency of native grasses than did horse-occupied sites. In contrast,
   sites with horses tended to have more grazing-resistant forbs and exotic
   plants. Direction and magnitude of landscape-scale results were
   corroborated by smaller-scale comparisons within horse-occupied sites of
   horse-trail transects and (randomly located) transects that
   characterized overall site conditions. Information-theoretic analyses
   that incorporated various subsets of abiotic variables suggested that
   presence of horses was generally a strong determinant of those
   vegetation-related variables that differed significantly between
   treatments, especially frequency and cover of grasses, but also species
   richness and shrub cover and frequency. In contrast, abiotic variables
   such as precipitation, site elevation, and soil erodibility best
   predicted characteristics such as forb cover, shrub frequency, and
   continuity of the shrub canopy. We found species richness of plants
   monotonically decreased across sites as grazing disturbance increased,
   suggesting that either the bell-shaped diversity-disturbance curve of
   the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis does not apply in this system or
   that most sites are already all on the greater-disturbance slope of the
   curve. In our study, numerous vegetation properties of less-grazed areas
   and sites differed notably from horse-grazed sites at local and
   landscape scales during a wetter and an average-precipitation year.}},

Abstract = {{Protection and/or establishment of forest plantation have been used as a
   management strategy to conserve and stop the deterioration of semi-arid
   Mediterranean grasslands ecosystems, producing a mosaic of vegetation
   types. This study was intended to investigate the changes in grassland
   community in response to protection and forest tree plantation practice
   as well as to explore the underlying environmental gradients responsible
   for the observed differences or similarities among these vegetation
   types. Two multivariate analysis methods including discriminate analysis
   and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling were used to quantify changes
   in community composition and attributes following different management
   practices (free grazing, protection with open grassland, sparse and
   dense forest tree plantations). This was investigated using species
   frequency, species abundance, or habitat characteristics. The study
   results showed that habitat types differed significantly between each
   other and were significantly separated using multivariate approaches.
   Discrimination based on habitat characteristics and species composition
   indicated that protection (or grazing) and light (or shade) explained
   more than 90\% of the observed variability in community changes in
   response to the protection and forest tree plantation. Also, results
   indicated that shade effect can be attributed to tree canopy cover
   and/or litter accumulation on the ground. It could be hypothesized that
   protection from grazing and afforestation resulted in complex
   environmental gradients of which shade, litter accumulation as well as
   protection from grazing disturbance are major constituents. A careful
   manipulation of protection and afforestation can be used to create a
   spatially different environmental gradients leading to greater habitat
   diversity as well as a greater species diversity, and better
   conservation means of grassland in semi-arid areas.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution, we report on patterns of spider species diversity
   of the Azores, based on recently standardised sampling protocols in
   different habitats of this geologically young and isolated volcanic
   archipelago. A total of 122 species is investigated, including eight new
   species, eight new records for the Azorean islands and 61 previously
   known species, with 131 new records for individual islands. Biodiversity
   patterns are investigated, namely patterns of range size distribution
   for endemics and non-endemics, habitat distribution patterns, island
   similarity in species composition and the estimation of species richness
   for the Azores. Newly described species are: Oonopidae-Orchestina
   furcillata Wunderlich; Linyphiidae: Linyphiinae - Porrhomma borgesi
   Wunderlich; Turinyphia cavernicola Wunderlich; Linyphiidae:
   Micronetinae-Agyneta depigmentata Wunderlich; Linyphiidae: Erigoninae -
   Acorigone gen. nov. with its type species Acorigone zebraneus
   Wunderlich; Clubionidae - Cheiracanthium floresense Wunderlich;
   Cheirocanthium J. jorgeense Wunderlich; Salticidae - Neon acoreensis
   Wunderlich. Other major taxonomic changes are: Diplocentria acoreensis
   Wunderlich, 1992 (Linyphiidae) is transferred to Acorigone (comb. nov.),
   Leucognatha Wunderlich 1995 (Tetragnathidae ) is not an endemic genus of
   the Azores but an African taxon and synonymous with Sancus Tullgren,
   1910; Leucognatha acoreensis Wunderlich, 1992 is transferred to Sancus.
   Minicia picoensis Wunderlich, 1992 is a synonym of M. floresensis
   Wunderlich, 1992. For each species additional information is presented
   about its known distribution in the islands, its colonisation status,
   habitat occurrence and biogeographical origin.}},

   richness were recorded in dry steppe/shrub and mountain steppe/tall
   shrub communities. whereas extrazonal grasslands and alpine steppes had
   the most depauperate myxomycete biota. Among three different groups of
   substrata (bark of shrubs, ground litter, and dung of herbivores)
   diverging trends in species richness and substrate specificity of the
   species were found: bark had the richest but least specific, dung the
   poorest but most specific myxomycete assemblage. A hierarchical cluster
   analysis carried out on the incidence-based Chao-Soerensen index clearly

Abstract = {{This study investigates how the floristic composition and species
   richness of fertile grasslands in the Swiss Alps has changed over the
   last three decades. A total of 259 phytosociological releves in four
   regions were resurveyed after periods of between 17 and 29 years.
   Analysis of the data revealed that floristic composition of the
   grasslands changed significantly during the study period, although the
   factor `time' explained only a small proportion of the total variation
   (2.0-4. 1 \%). The shifts in floristic composition were interpreted as
   indicators of changing management intensity due to continuing changes in
   agricultural structures. In three of the study regions there was an
   increase in species that are competitive under nutrient-rich conditions,
   possess high roughage quality and are tolerant of frequent mowing,
   indicating that the intensity of management had increased. Despite this
   apparent intensification, however, the initially high mean values per
   plot for species number (30.7-36.3) and evenness (0.72-0.77) mainly
   increased during the interval between the surveys. In the study region
   with the highest intensity of management, the abundance of weed species
   increased on some sites and the indicator value for roughage quality
   decreased, suggesting that intensification had been excessive and had
   destabilised these plant communities. Floristic shifts in the fourth
   study region, where the number of farms had declined considerably,
   mainly indicated extensification, especially on more marginal sites. The
   nature conservation value of the plant communities (i.e. number per plot
   of species indicating ecological quality) decreased in the three study
   regions where the floristic changes indicated that management had been
   intensified (-0.4 to -0.7 species) but increased in the fourth region (+
   1. 1 species). It is concluded that the intensification of management in
   the fertile grasslands of the Alpine regions studied has been less
   extreme than in many European lowland areas, and that the developments
   have in most cases been sustainable. However, the evidence of some
   destabilised plant communities suggests that management intensity is now
   too high on these sites, (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Current agri-environmental schemes and subsidies for conservation and
   restoration of semi-natural grasslands do not explicitly assess land use
   changes affecting whole landscapes, but have so far focused on single
   objects and small areas. In this paper, we discuss a landscape
   perspective versus a ``single object{''} perspective when conserving
   semi-natural grassland in agricultural landscapes. The focus is on the
   values biodiversity, cultural heritage, a vital countryside, and effects
   on economy when land use changes. We conclude that when land use change
   in the landscape surrounding an object, important additional effects on
   the different values are found. For example, a countryside where animals
   graze former arable fields and where marginal habitats are managed will
   have a positive effect, not only on the biodiversity associated to
   semi-natural grasslands, but also for the image of a vital and dynamic
   landscape. An increased number of roads, on the other hand, may
   negatively affect cultural heritage and decrease biodiversity in
   grasslands, leading to negative effects on the value of common goods
   through isolation. Placing objects in a larger spatial context and
   combining several different aspects into a landscape perspective, will
   improve long-term preservation of values associated to semi-natural
   grasslands. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   A GPS/GIS assessment}},

Abstract = {{Year-round mixed-species grazing at low densities in large-scale pasture
   systems has become a popular conservation concept as it is assumed to
   maintain the valuable biodiversity of semi-open cultural landscapes.
   This study aims to elucidate which vegetation types are preferentially
   grazed by cattle and sheep and whether the grazing animals change their
   preferences through the seasons so that year-round grazing leads to a
   utilization of all habitats. Additionally, we wanted to determine the
   main factors underlying the site use patterns of the animals.
   The study was conducted on 180 ha of a nature reserve and former
   military training area in northern Germany from January to October.
   Within this area, the positions of one cattle herd and one sheep flock
   were simultaneously recorded every 5 min using the global positioning
   system (GPS). For this purpose, we fitted one GPS collar alternately to
   three different cows and another to three different sheep. If the
   position of a collared animal had changed more than 6 m but less than
   100 m within 5 min grazing was assumed based on a validation of these
   thresholds by direct observation. Using a geographic information system,
   we analysed the location data with regard to vegetation characteristics,
   altitude, and distance from fences, water sources, and a sheep shed. For
   each month, we determined Ivlev's electivity index of both herbivore
   species in relation to eight broad vegetation types. We used multiple
   linear regression to create models that describe the grazing frequencies
   in the grid cells of the area depending on parameters of those grid
   cells and their spatial position.
   Cattle preferred moist and productive habitats, whereas sheep preferred
   dry and nutrient-poor habitats. Only when feed was in extremely short
   supply, the animals switched to sites they had previously avoided.
   Differences in the spatial preferences of the two species were more
   marked than seasonal changes. Spatial demands of cattle and sheep were
   largely complementary. Grazing sites with better water availability
   (i.e. lower distance from the drinking trough and ponds) were
   significantly preferred by cattle. The sheep preferred grazing sites
   close to their shed.
   Our results show that only a combination of different herbivores
   guarantees that all habitats of such a large low-intensity pasture are
   grazed and thus are kept in a management status favourable to
   conservation. However, the positioning of drinking troughs, fences, and
   sheds should be carefully considered as these facilities seriously
   influence the site use of the animals. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The target rate of afforestation in Ireland over the next 30 years is
   20,000 ha per year, which would result in an increase of the forest
   cover from the current 10\% to 17\%. In order to promote sustainable
   forest management practices, it is essential to know the composition and
   conservation value of habitats where afforestation is planned and the
   effects of subsequent planting upon biodiversity. The objectives of this
   study were to investigate changes in vegetation composition and
   diversity of grasslands 5 years after afforestation with Sitka spruce
   (Picea sitchensis) and determine the primary ecological and management
   factors responsible for these changes. Species cover, environmental and
   management data were collected from 16 afforested and unplanted improved
   and wet grassland site pairs in Ireland. Our results indicate that 5
   years after tree planting, there were significant changes in richness,
   composition, and abundance of species. Competitive and vigorous grasses
   were more abundant in planted than in unplanted sites, as were
   generalist species found in both open and wooded habitats, while
   small-stature shade-sensitive species were less abundant. Vascular plant
   species richness and Shannon's diversity index were higher in unplanted
   wet grassland, than in the planted sites. Bryophyte species richness was
   higher in planted improved grassland than in unplanted sites. The
   differences were primarily the result of the exclusion of grazing,
   ground preparation, changes in nutrient management and drainage for
   afforestation. Drainage ditches provided a temporary habitat for less
   competitive species, but the overall effect of drainage was to reduce
   the diversity of species dependent on wet conditions. Variance
   partitioning showed differences in the relative influences of
   environmental and management variables on biodiversity in the two
   habitats, probably due to the greater pre-afforestation grazing pressure
   and fertilisation levels in improved grasslands. The differences in
   biodiversity between planted and unplanted grasslands indicate that
   afforestation represents a threat to semi-natural habitats where
   distinctive and highly localised plant communities could potentially
   occur.}},

   consider only one response variable at a time, and even when multiple
   variables are examined they are analyzed separately. This means that a
   very important aspect of biodiversity is overlooked: the possibility for
   different species to carry out different functions at any one time. We
   propose a conceptual model to explore the effects of species loss on
   overall ecosystem functioning, where overall functioning is defined as
   the joint effect of many ecosystem functions. We show that, due to
   multifunctional complementarity among species, overall functioning is
   more susceptible to species loss than are single functions. Modeled
   relationships between species richness and overall ecosystem functioning
   using five empirical data sets on monocultures reflected the range of
   effects of species loss on multiple functions predicted by the model.
   Furthermore, an exploration of the correlations across functions and the
   degree of redundancy within functions revealed that multifunctional
   redundancy was generally lower than single-function redundancy in these
   empirical data sets. We suggest that by shifting the focus to the
   variety of functions maintained by a diversity of species, the full
   importance of biodiversity for the functioning of ecosystems can be
   uncovered. Our results are thus important for conservation and
   management of biota and ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{The relative importance of bottom-up or top-down forces has been mainly
   studied for herbivores but rarely for pollinators. Habitat fragmentation
   might change driving forces of population dynamics by reducing the area
   of resource-providing habitats, disrupting habitat connectivity, and
   affecting natural enemies more than their host species. We studied
   spatial and temporal population dynamics of the solitary bee Osmia rufa
   (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) in 30 fragmented orchard meadows ranging in
   size from 0.08 to 5.8 ha in an agricultural landscape in central
   Germany. From 1998 to 2003, we monitored local bee population size, rate
   of parasitism, and rate of larval and pupal mortality in reed trap nests
   as an accessible and standardized nesting resource. Experimentally
   enhanced nest site availability resulted in a steady increase of mean
   local population size from 80 to 2740 brood cells between 1998 and 2002.
   Population size and species richness of natural enemies increased with
   habitat area, whereas rate of parasitism and mortality only varied among
   years. Inverse density-dependent parasitism in three study years with
   highest population size suggests rather destabilizing instead of
   regulating effects of top-down forces. Accordingly, an analysis of
   independent time series showed on average a negative impact of
   population size on population growth rates but provides no support for
   top-down regulation by natural enemies. We conclude that population
   dynamics of O. rufa are mainly driven by bottom-up forces, primarily
   nest site availability.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in species richness and vegetation composition in the diverse
   semi-arid Succulent Karoo vegetation of South Africa were investigated
   after 67 (1937-2004) years of rest from livestock grazing at the
   Worcester Veld Reserve (WVR). This 72 ha reserve lies in the
   Worcester-Robertson Valley, 140 km east of Cape Town, South Africa (33
   degrees 39'S and 19 degrees 27'E). Vegetation change in 35 plots located
   on termitaria and 35 plots located in the insterstices between
   termitaria was assessed using field survey data and multivariate
   ordination techniques. Changes in plant cover and species composition on
   termitaria sites were consistently greater than for adjacent off
   termitaria sites. In addition, the north-facing slopes changed more than
   the south-facing slopes. There was a higher increase in diversity for
   off termitaria sites than for on termitaria sites. On termitaria, there
   was a general decrease in stem succulents, particularly Euphorbia
   mauritanica and an increase in long-lived evergreen shrubs and trees
   such as Pteronia incana and Rhus undulata. Most sites had similar
   compositional shifts primarily determined by their association with
   termitaria and secondarily with aspect. These findings suggest that a
   consistent directional change in vegetation composition has taken place
   as a result of protection from grazing. Contrary to the widely held view
   that a release from grazing has little benefit in degraded semi-arid
   vegetation, we find that a significant and predictable directional
   response to rest has occurred at this site over the study period. (c)

Volume = {{35}},

Abstract = {{Aim Increasing geographical range and density of conifers is a major
   form of land-cover change in the western United States, affecting fire
   frequency, biogeochemistry and possibly biodiversity. However, the
   extent and magnitude of the change are uncertain. This study aimed to
   quantify the relationship between changing conifer cover and topography.
   Location The central Great Basin in the state of Nevada, USA.
   Methods We used a series of Landsat Thematic Mapper satellite images
   from 1986, 1995 and 2005 to map change in pinyon-juniper woodlands
   (Pinus monophylla, Juniperus spp.) in the montane central Great Basin of
   Nevada. We derived fractional greenness for each year using spectral
   mixture analysis and identified all areas with an above average increase
   in greenness from 1986 to 1995 and 1995 to 2005.
   Results Areas with high fractional greenness in 2005 were most likely to
   occur at elevations between 2200 and 2600 m a.s.l. Increases in
   fractional greenness between 1986 and 2005 were most likely to occur at
   elevations below 2000 m a.s.l. and on south-facing slopes. However,
   relationships between elevation and increasing greenness for individual
   mountain ranges varied considerably from the average trend. Fractional
   greenness values measured by Landsat suggest that the majority of
   pinyon-juniper woodlands have not reached their maximum potential tree
   cover.
   Main conclusions Expansion of pinyon-juniper at low elevations and on
   south-facing slopes probably reflects increasing precipitation in the
   20th century, higher water use efficiency caused by increasing
   atmospheric CO2 in the late 20th century and livestock grazing at the
   interface between shrubland and woodland. Identification of the spatial
   relationships between changing fractional greenness of pinyon-juniper
   woodland and topography can inform regional land management and improve
   projections of long-term ecosystem change.}},

Title = {{Agricultural land use and biodiversity in the Alps - How cultural
   tradition and socioeconomically motivated changes are shaping grassland
   biodiversity in the Swiss Alps}},
Journal = {{MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Alpine grasslands are ecosystems with a great diversity of plant
   species. However, little is known about other levels of biodiversity,
   such as landscape diversity, diversity of biological interactions of
   plants with herbivores or fungal pathogens, and genetic diversity. We
   therefore explored natural and anthropogenic determinants of grassland
   biodiversity at several levels of biological integration, from the
   genetic to the landscape level in the Swiss Alps. Differences between
   cultural traditions (Romanic, Germanic, and Walser) turned out to still
   affect land use diversity and thus landscape diversity. Increasing land
   use diversity, in turn, increased plant species diversity per village.
   However, recent land use changes have reduced this diversity. Within
   grassland parcels, plant species diversity was higher on unfertilized
   mown grasslands than on fertilized or grazed ones. Most individual
   plants were affected by herbivores and fungal leaf pathogens, reflecting
   that parcels harbored a great diversity of herbivores and pathogens.
   However, as plant damage by herbivores and pathogens was not severe,
   conserving these biological interactions among plants is hardly
   compromising agricultural goals. A common-garden experiment revealed
   genetic differentiation of the important fodder grass Poa alpina between
   mown and grazed sites, suggesting adaptation. Per-village genetic
   diversity of Poa alpina was greater in villages with higher land use
   diversity, analogous to the higher plant species diversity there.
   Overall, landscape diversity and biodiversity within grassland parcels
   are currently declining. As this contradicts the intention of Swiss law
   and international agreements, financial incentives need to be
   re-allocated and should focus on promoting high biodiversity at the
   local and the landscape level. At the same time, this will benefit
   landscape attractiveness for tourists and help preserve a precious
   cultural heritage in the Swiss Alps.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work from the Plains of Serengeti National Park ( SNP)
   suggested that plant species composition ( i. e. the composite measure
   of species' identities and abundances) is unchanged on the temporal
   scale of decades ( Belsky 1985), raising the possibility that African
   grazing ecosystems may be resistant to climate change. In this study,
   grassland plant composition was measured three times between 2000 and
   2007 at eight permanent sites spanning the SNP environmental gradient.
   Confirming previous work, plots in the Serengeti Plains were relatively
   stable with respect to plant composition through time. In contrast,
   sites in all other regions of the ecosystem showed greater change in
   plant species composition during the study. Three factors, annual
   rainfall, dry season rainfall, and fire frequency, were linearly
   correlated ( all r > 0.73) with the amount of composition change at the
   sites. A path model, which accounted for the strong correlation between
   annual and dry season rainfall and for the known effect of annual
   rainfall on fire frequency, was used to elucidate which factors were
   associated with composition change and which were spuriously correlated.
   The path model demonstrated that change in plant composition was
   positively related to annual rainfall, but not dry season rainfall or
   fire frequency. However, dry season rainfall was positively associated
   with changes in plant species identity, one component of compositional
   change, across sites over time. Because climate models predict both
   increased wet season and decreased dry season rainfall in East Africa,
   these findings raise uncertainty about how these grasslands will respond
   to future changes. This study and others ( Belsky 1985) suggests that
   plant assemblages adapted to low rainfall in Serengeti may exhibit
   compositionally stability, while the same may not be true in regions of
   higher average rainfall and larger species pools.}},

Abstract = {{Belowground foodwebs, which dominate energy flow in temperate systems,
   may yield insights into general foodweb function: do consumers drive
   resource levels or simply respond to them? Controversy exists about the
   relationships among fine roots, mycorrhizal fungi and invertebrate
   grazers because of the difficulty of studying belowground processes. We
   used contrasting temporal scales to examine relationships among roots,
   fungi and collembola in the top 90 cm of soil in native grassland and
   forest over three years, with data collected from minirhizotrons. Root
   production was generally similar between habitats, but fungal production
   and collembola density were mostly significantly greater in forest than
   grassland. All variables decreased significantly with increasing depth,
   except for forest mycorrhizal fungi. This exception suggests that forest
   mycorrhizae are especially important for nutrient uptake at greater soil
   depths. Relationships among roots, mycorrhizal fungi and collembola
   varied with the temporal scale considered. Over the entire growing
   season, collembola were significantly positively correlated with root
   production in forest, and with both fungal and root production in
   grassland, reflecting the broad positive associations between these
   groups. In contrast, over the shortest sampling interval (i.e. two
   weeks), strong negative relationships suggested that collembola grazing
   decreased fungal and root production. Data from all dates and depths
   considered together revealed that both fungal and root production were
   significantly higher at intermediate collembola density than at low or
   very high density. In summary, belowground consumers appear to drive
   resource levels at short time scales, but respond to broad variation in
   resource availability at annual time scales.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous recent studies have tested the effects of plant, pollinator,
   and predator diversity on primary productivity, pollination, and
   consumption, respectively. Many have shown a positive relationship,
   particularly in controlled experiments, but variability in results has
   emphasized the context-dependency of these relationships. Complementary
   resource use may lead to a positive relationship between diversity and
   these processes, but only when a diverse array of niches is available to
   be partitioned among species. Therefore, the slope of the
   diversity-function relationship may change across differing levels of
   heterogeneity, but empirical evaluations of this pattern are lacking.
   Here we examine three important functions/properties in different real
   world (i.e., nonexperimental) ecosystems: plant biomass in German
   grasslands, parasitism rates across five habitat types in coastal
   Ecuador, and coffee pollination in agroforestry systems in Indonesia. We
   use general linear and structural equation modeling to demonstrate that
   the effect of diversity on these processes is context dependent, such
   that the slope of this relationship increases in environments where
   limiting resources (soil nutrients, host insects, and coffee flowers,
   respectively) are spatially heterogeneous. These real world patterns,
   combined with previous experiments, suggest that biodiversity may have
   its greatest impact on the functioning of diverse, naturally
   heterogeneous ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The forage yield and quality and the growth of beef calves were examined
   in a 3-year study on four farms on coastal meadows of the Bothnian Bay,
   Finland. The forage yield at the end of June (1704 kg dry matter ha(-1)
   in average) was considerably lower than that of cultivated grasslands,
   whereas the nutritional quality of the forage was approximately at the
   same level. The daily gain of calves on coastal meadows was I kg day(-1)
   on average. The calves raised on the coastal meadows had equal live
   weights as the beef calves of the same age in northern Finland in
   general. The interaction between breed and pasture type tended to be
   significant, indicating that Simmental was capable of slightly better
   utilisation of coastal meadows than Limousin. Calculation of the
   nutrient budget showed that the amount of P entering the coastal meadows
   with creep feeding (0.046 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) constituted a minor
   proportion of the total P load. Eutrophication of grazed semi-natural
   grasslands can be most effectively prevented with reasonable usage of
   additional minerals. The use of a suitable type of livestock and
   stocking rate and the timing of the grazing season were considered to be
   important aspects for adjusting the biodiversity management and
   livestock performance on coastal meadows. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In European mountain areas, shrub encroachment resulting from farmland
   abandonment is most often managed by mechanical operations such as
   roller chopping or controlled burning, which have proved to be
   ineffective and unsustainable. Recent agroecological findings highlight
   the potential impact of grazing on long-term shrub dynamics. We thus
   explored the potential contribution of livestock farms to the management
   of shrub encroachment. We studied the diversity of livestock practices
   and strategies on the scale of a small mountain valley in France where a
   land-use management plan was initiated. We interviewed 33 livestock
   farmers with a comprehensive approach and analysed the data in
   partnership with local land-use managers. To categorise farming
   practices, we used an innovative constructivist method based on
   knowledge engineering techniques and tools such as repertory grids. Our
   results show that the diversity of land-use practices can be summed up
   by ten practices related to three management domains: (i) livestock
   management, that is, splitting herds into batches, leading animals to
   pasture and breeding choices; (ii) the feeding system, including indoor
   feeding during the year, the hierarchy between haymaking and grazing in
   spring and the system's forage autonomy; and (iii) farmland utilisation
   and maintenance, which comprises hillside use, spatial configuration of
   grazed areas, maintenance practices and technical choices to cut
   meadows. We also show that farmers combine these practices within six
   types of strategies: ensuring feeding security and simplifying labour
   (type A), maintaining farmland heritage (type B), taking advantage of
   hillsides (type C), focusing on animal care (type D), combining areas,
   periods and batches (type E), or selling on local markets (type F). This
   makes it possible to identify: (1) farmers' strategies that have the
   greatest impact on shrub encroachment; and (2) practices that may
   develop into more sustainable management of shrub encroachment. Our work
   is thus a first step in developing sustainable land-use management plans
   in rural areas threatened by shrub encroachment. In return, this deep
   understanding of farmers' strategies allowed us to address socially
   pertinent scientific issues related to the dynamics of grazed plant
   communities.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{The response of grasslands to disturbance varies with the nature of the
   disturbance and the productivity of the landscape. In highly productive
   grasslands, competitive exclusion often results in decreased species
   richness and grazing may allow more species to coexist. Once widespread,
   grasslands dominated by Dichanthium sericeum (Queensland bluegrass) and
   Astrebla spp. (Mitchell grass) occur on fertile plains but have been
   reduced in extent by cultivation. We tested the effects of exclusion of
   livestock grazing on these grasslands by comparing the floristic
   composition of sites in a nature reserve with an adjacent stock reserve.
   In addition, sites that had been cultivated within the nature reserve
   were compared with those where grazing but no cultivation had occurred.
   To partition the effects of temporal variation from spatial variation we
   sampled sites in three different years (1998, 2002 and 2004). Some 194
   taxa were recorded at the nature reserve and surrounding stock routes.
   Sampling time, the occurrence of past cultivation and livestock grazing
   all influenced species composition. Species richness varied greatly
   between sampling periods relating to highly variable rainfall and water
   availability on heavy clay soils. Native species richness was
   significantly lower at previously cultivated sites (13-22 years after
   cultivation), but was not significantly influenced by grazing exclusion.
   After 8 years it appears that reintroducing disturbance in the form of
   livestock grazing is not necessary to maintain plant species richness in
   the reserve. The highly variable climate (e.g. droughts) probably plays
   an important role in the coexistence of species by negating competitive
   exclusion and allowing interstitial species to persist.}},

Abstract = {{Community assembly and the factors that influence it have long been a
   topic of interest to ecologists, but theory has yet to produce
   unequivocal evidence that communities assemble in predictable ways. The
   goal of this study was to document the relationship between ant
   communities and environmental variation between four habitat types. To
   accomplish this, ant communities and 16 environmental variables were
   sampled across four different habitat types in the Black Belt Prairie
   and Flatwoods regions in Mississippi. Furthermore, ant species were
   placed into functional groups for an analysis of the relationship
   between the assembly of ecological communities and variation in
   ecosystem function. A total of 20,916 ants representing 68 species was
   collected across the four habitat types. Nonmetric multidimensional
   scaling and analysis of covariance analyses both revealed three distinct
   ant communities, which can be characterized by habitat type: pasture,
   prairie, and woodland. Principle components analysis (PCA) simplified
   the 16 environmental variables into four principle components that
   explained 78\% of the variation among sites. Results of multiple
   regression using the four PCA axes as predictor variables suggest that
   regional variation in soil structure, land cover type, and the presence
   of grazing have had major influences on ant community composition.
   Variation in flora and habitat architecture had smaller but significant
   effects on ant species diversity and functional group composition. Our
   results imply that restoration of native ant communities in disturbed
   habitats must consider how current disturbance regimens likely interact
   with the presence of Solenopsis to lower ant biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Stability of exotic annual grasses following restoration efforts in
   southern California coastal sage scrub}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{495-504}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. Restoration of semi-arid shrub ecosystems often requires control of
   invasive grasses but the effects of these grass-control treatments on
   native and exotic forbs have not been investigated adequately to assess
   long-term stability. In southern California, coastal sage scrub (CSS)
   vegetation is one semi-arid shrub community that has been invaded
   extensively by both exotic grasses and exotic forbs and is a target for
   restoration.
   2. We studied the effects of grass-specific herbicide, thatch removal
   plus herbicide and mowing on native and exotic species in a heavily
   invaded CSS community. We followed this grass-control experiment for 6
   years to assess the stability of such treatments. We also added a soil
   disturbance experiment to investigate the potential influence of thatch
   removal and soil disturbance on exotic and native grasses and forbs.
   3. In the grass-control experiment, treatments reduced exotic grass
   cover to differing degrees. Three years of mowing resulted in lower
   exotic grass cover, but only for 2 years. Both herbicide and herbicide
   plus thatch removal reduced exotic grasses more than mowing, and effects
   persisted for longer. However, reducing exotic grass cover increased
   seeded species only during the year of seeding. In addition, plots where
   exotic grasses were controlled by herbicides also experienced increases
   in exotic forb cover.
   4. In the soil-disturbance experiment, treatments did not increase cover
   of native species, although plots in which soil was disturbed did have
   less exotic grass cover. In both experiments, plots observed in years
   with different rainfall experienced widely varied plant cover,
   emphasizing the influence that precipitation exerts in these systems.
   5. Synthesis and applications. In restoration of semi-arid shrub
   ecosystems, grass control can reduce exotic grasses over the short-term.
   However, recovery of grasses in the longer term indicates that
   restoration does not form a new stable state. Restoration and management
   of semi-arid shrublands may therefore require continual grass control.
   Exotic forbs should also be considered for control, as they may increase
   when exotic grasses are removed. Yearly variations in precipitation
   confound determination of successful restoration efforts, and require
   long-term observations to detect the response of native species to
   treatments.}},

Title = {{Land-use change and subalpine tree dynamics: colonization of Larix

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},

Pages = {{659-669}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. In many places in Europe, trees are currently far below their
   theoretical altitudinal limit because of past land use. However, under
   the current crisis affecting mountain agriculture, trees are likely to
   recolonize the subalpine belt. Addressing the societal issues associated
   with such landscape change requires predictive tools to assess
   vegetation dynamics in relation to management strategies. This study
   aims to analyse the factors determining tree dynamics at the subalpine
   ecotone and to evaluate the impact of land-use change on landscape
   vegetation patterns.
   2. We developed a hierarchical scaling approach and applied it to a
   European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) colonization in the French Alps.
   Our landscape case study focused on subalpine south-facing grasslands of
   Villar d'Arene (France). First, we used a habitat-suitability model to
   delineate the climatic suitability habitats of larch in the French Alps.
   Then we used a landscape model (LaMoS) to determine whether larch is
   able to colonize these grasslands predicted to be climatically suitable,
   considering land use and local vegetation. The sensitivity of landscape
   colonization patterns to land-use scenarios (abandonment, delayed mowing
   or traditional mowing) and biological attributes of larch were analysed
   with a factorial simulation experiment.
   3. The accuracy of the habitat-suitability model at the French Alps
   scale allowed for the prediction that the grasslands of Villar d'Arene
   were highly suitable for larch.
   4. Simulations highlighted the effect of land use on larch establishment
   at the local but not at the landscape scale. On the other hand, larch
   attributes such as dispersal capacity, juvenile tolerance to light
   interaction (competition and facilitation) and its capacity to survive
   on infertile soil were shown as essential for tree spatial dynamics.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Combining a habitat-suitability model
   with a spatially and temporally explicit landscape model enhances the
   capacity to account for environmental factors acting at different
   overlapping scales. This modelling strategy increases the robustness and
   accuracy of predictions, a prerequisite for landscape management in a
   global change context. We conclude that ongoing and future
   agri-environmental policies have to be quickly adapted to protect
   biodiversity and ecosystem services provided by subalpine grasslands.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{670-679}},

Abstract = {{1. Restoration of high plant species diversity to sites where it has
   been reduced by intensive grassland management requires identification
   of appropriate management regimes. Understanding the combinatorial
   effects of management on above-ground vegetation and below-ground
   microbial communities will inform management prescriptions on how best
   to increase plant diversity, restore rare vegetation types and achieve
   agri-environmental objectives.
   2. Changes in vegetation and soil microbial community structure are
   described from the second phase of a 1990-2004 field trial that
   investigated the interacting effects of fertilizer and farmyard manure
   (FYM) treatments imposed after 1998, in the context of previous hay-cut
   date and seed-addition treatments.
   3. Hay-cut date was the main factor influencing plant species
   composition in phase 1, whereas FYM was the dominant factor in phase 2.
   4. Poa trivialis and Lolium perenne increased in abundance with FYM
   application, particularly in combination with mineral fertilizer, and
   particularly in 2002 after the 2001 foot and mouth epidemic. The lowest
   Ellenberg fertility scores were associated with absence of FYM and
   mineral fertilizer but with addition of seed.
   5. The highest plant species diversity in phase 2 was associated with
   seed addition and the absence of mineral fertilizer, an effect that had
   probably persisted from phase 1. Progressive development of the target
   traditional meadow vegetation occurred through phase 2.
   6. Fungal:bacterial (F:B) ratios, a measure of changes in the relative
   abundance of fungi and bacteria in the microbial community, generally
   increased from 1996 to 2004, and were particularly high in the
   seed-addition treatments and in the absence of fertilizer. Here the high
   F:B ratios were associated with species (including legumes) typical of
   traditionally managed mesotrophic grassland in northern England.
   7. Synthesis and applications. These results demonstrate that
   biodiversity goals for upland meadows need to plan beyond the typical
   5-10-year management agreement period of agri-environment schemes.
   Combination treatments, in which seed addition is vital, alongside
   appropriate fertilizer, FYM, hay-cut date and grazing regimes, are
   needed for grassland restoration. However, even after 14 years the most
   effective treatment combinations had still not restored the target
   species composition and diversity. The demonstrated change in soil
   microbial communities, linked to the growth of legumes, might be
   important to facilitate future increases in plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Buffer strips are refuges for a variety of plants providing resources,
   such as pollen, nectar and seeds, for higher trophic levels, including
   invertebrates, mammals and birds. Margins can also harbour plant species
   that are potentially injurious to the adjacent arable crop (undesirable
   species). Sowing perennial species in non-cropped buffer strips can
   reduce weed incidence, but limits the abundance of annuals with the
   potential to support wider biodiversity (desirable species). We
   investigated the responses of unsown plant species present in buffer
   strips established with three different seed mixes managed annually with
   three contrasting management regimes (cutting, sward scarification and
   selective graminicide). Sward scarification had the strongest influence
   on the unsown desirable (e.g. Sonchus spp.) and unsown pernicious (e.g.
   Elytrigia repens) species, and was generally associated with higher
   cover values of these species. However, abundances of several desirable
   weed species, in particular Poa annua, were not promoted by
   scarification. The treatments of cutting and graminicide tended to have
   negative impacts on the unsown species, except for Cirsium vulgare,
   which increased with graminicide application. Differences in unsown
   species cover between seed mixes were minimal, although the grass-only
   mix was more susceptible to establishment by C. vulgare and Galium
   aparine than the two grass and forb mixes. Annual scarification can
   enable desirable annuals and sown perennials to co-exist, however, this
   practice can also promote pernicious species, and so is unlikely to be
   widely adopted as a management tool in its current form.}},

Abstract = {{The study characterizes historical land-use change and the development
   of semi-natural grassland habitats, over 274 years, within a mosaic
   agricultural landscape (22 km(2)) on the island of Oland (Sweden). We
   also explore the relationship between previous land-use, habitat
   continuity and present-day vascular plant species richness in grassland
   patches. Land-cover maps, based on cadastral maps and aerial
   photographs, were produced for six time-periods between 1723/1733 and
   1994/1997. In 1723/1733, the landscape was dominated by grasslands, with
   arable land surrounding the villages. The grassland area decreased
   throughout the study period and grassland patches became progressively
   more fragmented. Present-day grasslands represent 18\% of the grassland
   area in 1723/1733. The land-use structure of the early 18th century is
   still evident in the modem landscape. The majority of the present-day
   grasslands are situated on former common grazing land and have had a
   continuity of at least 274 years: the remaining grasslands are younger
   and developed during the 20th century on arable or forested land. The
   proportion of plant species that depend on grazing and are
   characteristic of semi-natural grasslands significantly reflects the
   continuity and previous land-use of grassland sites. The study
   illustrates the way in which information on historical land-use and
   habitat continuity can help to explain the structuring of plant
   assemblages in semi-natural grasslands within the modem landscape. (c)

Abstract = {{Identifying the biotic (e.g. decomposers, vegetation) and abiotic (e.g.
   temperature, moisture) mechanisms controlling litter decomposition is
   key to understanding ecosystem function, especially where variation in
   ecosystem structure due to successional processes may alter the strength
   of these mechanisms. To identify these controls and feedbacks, I
   measured mass loss and N flux in herbaceous, leaf, and wood litter along
   a successional gradient of ecosystem types (old field, transition
   forest, old-growth forest) while manipulating detritivore access to
   litter. Ecosystem type, litter type, and decomposers contributed
   directly and interactively to decomposition. Litter mass loss and N
   accumulation was higher while litter C:N remained lower in old-growth
   forests than in either old fields or transition forest. Old-growth
   forests influenced litter dynamics via microclimate (coolest and
   wettest) but also, apparently, through a decomposer community adapted to
   consuming the large standing stocks of leaf litter, as indicated by
   rapid leaf litter loss. In all ecosystem types, mass loss of herbaceous
   litter was greater than leaf litter which, in turn was greater than
   wood. However, net N loss from wood litter was faster than expected,
   suggesting localized N flux effects of wood litter. Restricting
   detritivore access to litter reduced litter mass loss and slowed the
   accumulation of N in litter, suggesting that macro - detritivores affect
   both physical and chemical characteristics of litter through selective
   grazing. These data suggest that the distinctive litter loss rates and
   efficient N cycling observed in old-growth forest ecosystems are not
   likely to be realized soon after old fields are restored to forested
   ecosystems. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.}},

Title = {{Simulating grassland utilization in beef suckler systems to investigate
   the trade-offs between production and floristic diversity}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{1-3}},
Pages = {{260-272}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In order to understand the farm-scale balance between the apparently
   conflicting objectives of system production and biodiversity
   conservation in grassland-based beef suckler systems, we constructed the
   whole-farm simulation model SEBIEN.
   SEBIEN uses a bio-technical approach focussed on grassland utilization
   by the herd to predict the daily functioning of suckler systems based on
   permanent pasture. The farming system is divided into three main
   components which interact at multiple time scales: (i) management,
   divided into a strategic component (management plan) and a tactical
   component (management rules), (ii) herd, divided into a group of cows
   with calf and a group of heifers, and (iii) feed, comprising grasslands
   paddocks, conserved forage and purchased feed (hay and concentrate).
   Each component is the subject of a sub-model. The dynamic models
   predicting animal intake and performance and permanent pasture growth,
   structure and digestibility have been published previously. The
   management sub-model is described.
   The inputs to SEBIEN include farm structure (= description of herd and
   grassland resources), management plan (= animal production objectives
   and grassland utilization), thresholds for management rules and weather
   data which introduces variability between seasons and years. The outputs
   of SEBIEN include the daily operation of the forage system, the dynamics
   of intake and performance for the average animals of the herd, and the
   dynamics of grassland production and utilization on each paddock. To
   characterize the production biodiversity trade-offs at farm scale, we
   translated these outputs into an indicator of system production based on
   animal sales and forage self-sufficiency, and into an indicator of
   floristic diversity based on soil fertility and grassland utilization
   rates on each paddock.
   We simulated three case studies based on real farms with SEBIEN,
   compared their balance between production and floristic diversity and
   its response to biodiversity-friendly management rules such as late hay
   harvest and low grazing intensity. SEBIEN predicted that animal
   production was not systematically in conflict with floristic diversity
   at farm scale. The balance between grassland productivity and stocking
   rate was determinant for both floristic diversity and forage
   self-sufficiency. For all farms production remained unchanged when
   intermediate levels of biodiversity-friendly management rules were
   applied (40\% of hay paddocks cut after flowering, or paddock change at
   grazing when sward height dropped under 8 cm). Though, the pattern and
   amplitude of the responses differed between farms. At farm scale, an
   increase in floristic diversity on a few paddocks sometimes led to a
   decrease on other paddocks, which confirms that farm-scale analysis are
   needed to evaluate the effects of field-scale environmental policies.

Title = {{Does germination success differ with respect to seed mass and
   germination season? Experimental testing of plant functional trait
   responses to grassland management}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{101}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{541-548}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Plant functional trait responses to processes such
   as grassland management have been analysed frequently; however, the
   scaling-up from individual traits to the outcomes of vegetation dynamics
   has seldom been tested. In this experiment, germination success was
   studied with respect to the relationships between grassland management
   (mowing and grazing), as well as abandonment, and two traits that are
   relevant for seedling recruitment: seed mass and germination season. On
   the basis of discussions in the literature and indirect trait analyses
   in our previous studies, the following hypotheses are proposed: (1) with
   respect to seed mass, mowing and grazing favour the germination of small
   seeds, whereas after abandonment the germination success of larger seeds
   is higher; and (2) with respect to germination season, mowing and
   grazing favour autumn-germinating seeds, whereas succession promotes
   spring-germinating seeds.
   Methods The germination experiment took place in a semi-natural, dry
   grassland in north-east Germany. Seeds of eight herbaceous species that
   differ with respect to seed mass and germination season were sown in
   mown, grazed and abandoned plots. Germination success was documented
   during the following year.
   Key Results and Conclusions Contrary to the hypothesis, germination of
   small seeds was not promoted by mowing or grazing and they germinated
   relatively more often than expected in the abandoned plots. A
   relationship between abandonment and gaps of bare soil below the
   vegetation cover that favour germination of small seeds was likely, but
   could not be proved statistically. It is possible that the small seeds
   suffered less from predation. Mowing favoured autumn germination, which
   could be explained by the removal of biomass in late summer. Contrary to
   our expectation, there was relatively more spring germination after
   grazing than after mowing, yet vegetation height was smallest in spring.
   Generally, germination season was found to be related to the temporal
   occurrence of favourable light conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Many species of Tachinidae are important parasitoids of herbivorous
   insects in natural and managed systems; yet, little is known about
   tachinid diversity and how this diversity is distributed across space
   and time. Here, pan trap sampling was used to analyze the richness,
   microhabitat specificity, and seasonal diversity of a tachinid
   parasitoid community in an Oakmesquite savanna of Southeastern Arizona.
   Twenty-four traps were set out monthly during the growing season in
   three different microhabitats (open grassland, woodland understory, and
   woodland canopy). In total, 79 tachinid species were sampled with an
   estimated total diversity of 122 species. Most individual traps sampled
   few species; yet, variation in species composition (beta diversity)
   among sampling dates and microhabitats was high, accounting for 40-70\%
   of the total diversity. Significant intraspecific aggregation was not
   observed across traps or microhabitats, but it was observed across
   dates, suggesting that the activity of tachinid species may be
   associated with host phenology and seasonal periods of precipitation.
   The 0 diversity associated with microhabitat 4 and sampling date was
   significantly greater than expected. Tachinid species diversity was
   highest in the canopy traps, whereas the open-exposed traps exhibited
   high abundances of relatively few species, and understory traps sampled
   few individuals of few species. Most species tended to be sampled where
   their hosts would be expected to be found, although males were also
   frequently sampled in microhabitats associated with mate finding. These
   patterns of diversity and abundance may aid in understanding
   parasitoid-host associations and variation in rates of parasitism by
   tachinid flies.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{646-654}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Invasive plants are, simply by occupying a large amount of space in
   invaded habitats, expected to impose a significant impact on the native
   vegetation and their associated food webs. However, little is known
   about the impact of invasive plants both on native vegetation and on
   different invertebrate feeding guilds at the habitat level. Yet, studies
   addressing multiple trophic levels, e.g. plant species, herbivores,
   predators and detrivores, are likely to yield additional insight into
   how and under which conditions invasive weeds alter ecosystem structures
   and processes. We set out to assess whether plant species richness and
   invertebrate assemblages in European riparian habitats invaded by exotic
   knotweeds (Fallopia spp.) differed from those found in native grassland-
   or bush-dominated riparian habitats, which are both potentially
   threatened by knotweed invasion. Our findings suggest that riparian
   habitats invaded by knotweeds support lower numbers of plant species and
   lower overall abundance and morphospecies richness of invertebrates,
   compared to native grassland-dominated and bush-dominated habitats.
   Total invertebrate abundance and morphospecies richness in
   Fallopia-invaded riparian habitats were correlated with native plant
   species richness, suggesting that there is a link between the
   replacement of native plant species by exotic Fallopia species and the
   reduction in overall invertebrate abundance and morphospecies richness.
   Moreover, biomass of invertebrates sampled in grassland and
   bush-dominated habitats was almost twice as high as that in
   Fallopia-invaded habitats. Large-scale invasion by exotic Fallopia
   species is therefore likely to seriously affect biodiversity and reduce
   the quality of riparian ecosystems for amphibians, reptiles, birds and
   mammals whose diets are largely composed of arthropods. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{We present a landscape model to investigate the ecological consequences
   and costs of different management regimes in semi-natural grasslands.
   The model integrates dynamic abiotic conditions, management (i.e.
   disturbance) regime and response of more than 50 characteristic plant
   and insect species by modelling the dynamics of relevant niche
   parameters as predictors for species distribution models. We compare our
   results for exemplary scenarios differing in spatial and temporal scales
   and exemplary species belonging to different functional groups through
   several steps of aggregation.
   Our analysis aims at the question whether an infrequent massive
   disturbance by rototilling can serve as a less expensive alternative to
   annual mowing for preserving the characteristic species composition of
   open dry grasslands in Southern Germany. Rototilling results in a
   shifting mosaic determining the habitat quality for plant and animal
   species that may reduce the survival of local or regional populations.
   For some meadow species as well as the encroaching shrub species,
   rototilling has a detrimental effect on regional habitat quality. Other
   species, e.g. weeds and annual pioneers, strongly benefit or show only
   negligible reaction. Since this is a multi-objective problem, there is a
   no magic bullet in selecting an optimum scenario of measures. But by
   visualising the trade-off between ecological consequences and costs, our
   model is a valuable tool for conservation managers providing a sound
   scientific basis for management decisions relying on available
   ecological knowledge. It is also an interesting example for a model
   describing complex communities in a relatively simple way,
   simultaneously considering the main driving factors. (c) Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{89}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Insects and spiders comprise more than two-thirds of the Earth's total
   species diversity. There is wide concern, however, that the global
   diversity of arthropods may be declining even more rapidly than the
   diversity of vertebrates and plants. For adequate conservation planning,
   ecologists need to understand the driving factors for arthropod
   communities and devise methods that provide reliable predictions when
   resources do not permit exhaustive ground surveys. Which factor most
   successfully predicts arthropod community structure is still a matter of
   debate, however. The purpose of this study was to identify the factor
   best predicting arthropod assemblage composition. We investigated the
   species composition of seven functionally different arthropod groups
   (epigeic spiders, grasshoppers, ground beetles, weevils, hoppers,
   hoverflies, and bees) at 47 sites in The Netherlands comprising a range
   of seminatural grassland types and one heathland type. We then compared
   the actual arthropod composition with predictions based on plant species
   composition, vegetation structure, environmental data, flower richness,
   and landscape composition. For this we used the recently published
   method of predictive co-correspondence analysis, and a predictive
   variant of canonical correspondence analysis, depending on the type of
   predictor data. Our results demonstrate that local plant species
   composition is the most effective predictor of arthropod assemblage
   composition, for all investigated groups. In predicting arthropod
   assemblages, plant community composition consistently outperforms both
   vegetation structure and environmental conditions ( even when the two
   are combined), and also performs better than the surrounding landscape.
   These results run against a common expectation of vegetation structure
   as the decisive factor. Such expectations, however, have always been
   biased by the fact that until recently no methods existed that could use
   an entire ( plant) species composition in the explanatory role. Although
   more recent experimental diversity work has reawakened interest in the
   role of plant species, these studies still have not used ( or have not
   been able to use) entire species compositions. They only consider
   diversity measures, both for plant and insect assemblages, which may
   obscure relationships. The present study demonstrates that the species
   compositions of insect and plant communities are clearly linked.}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigated how the abundance and sexual reproduction
   of herbs and grasses relates to the presence of shrubs of Rosa dumalis
   in three semi-natural pastures in Sweden. Shrubs may affect grassland
   plants negatively by competition, positively by serving as grazing
   refuge, or neutrally. At different distances from shrubs of R. dumalis,
   data were collected on plant abundance, frequency of reproductive
   shoots, vegetation height and litter depth. In one grassland, data were
   collected on seedling density and frequency of reproductive shoots in
   the presence and absence of grazing. The shrubs functioned as grazing
   refuges with taller vegetation, deeper litter and higher probability of
   reproduction by plants. The overall number of plant species remained the
   same at all distances from shrubs. Most species showed a neutral
   relationship with shrubs. Proportionately, 0.08-0.26 of the species
   showed a negative pattern to shrubs and 0.14-0.30 a positive pattern.
   Seedling density was negatively correlated with litter depth and peaked
   at 60-90 cm from shrubs. Establishment of seedlings of small-seeded
   species was negatively related to shrubs probably because of thicker
   litter layer close to shrubs. The observed patterns were compared with
   different functional traits, such as Ellenberg values, plant height,
   growth form and Raunkiaer life form. Plant height from data in the
   literature was the trait that best explained the relationship of plant
   species to shrubs because tall species were more common in proximity to
   shrubs. It was concluded that shrubs increase the heterogeneity in
   grasslands and that intensive shrub-clearing may negatively affect
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{To maintain biodiversity in semi-natural grasslands, the choice of breed
   of livestock and season of grazing can be important. The objective was
   to determine the effects of breed and season on the composition of plant
   fragments in the faeces of cattle grazing a heterogeneous semi-natural
   grassland. Twelve heifers of the traditional Swedish Vaneko breed (live
   weight 309 kg) and twelve heifers of the Charolais breed (live weight
   431 kg) were allocated to three pastures per breed. Faeces samples were
   collected in spring, summer and autumn for micro-histological
   examination of plant fragments. On the same occasion, defoliation of
   four competitive plant species was recorded. Faecal plant fragments
   mainly consisted of grasses but also herbs, whereas Cyperaceae, despite
   their abundance on the pastures, only composed a small proportion of
   fragments. Season affected the composition of plant fragments in the
   faeces, with a higher proportion of Cyperaceae and herbs in spring than
   later in the grazing period (P < 0.001), and the heifers ingesting more
   grasses and woody plants in autumn. In spite of a clear difference in
   live weight between the two breeds, no effects of breed on the
   composition of plant fragments in faeces were observed, although Vaneko
   heifers defoliated more Filipendula ulmaria in spring than the Charolais
   heifers (P < 0.01). In addition, defoliation of Alnus glutinosa
   increased later in the grazing period (P < 0.05), especially for the
   Vaneko heifers, indicating control of pernicious brushwood by grazing
   may be more effective in autumn.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-arid ecosystems cover tens of millions of hectares in the
   Intermountain West of the United States, and most have altered plant
   communities due to land use, especially livestock grazing. Thus,
   relatively unaltered ``reference{''} plant community information is
   needed to guide restoration. Plant communities were sampled over a large
   (similar to 600 000 ha) semi-and landscape in western Colorado, within
   pinon-juniper woodlands, sagebrush shrublands, and grasslands, and over
   conditions ranging from relict areas without livestock grazing to
   heavily utilized areas. Ordination was used to group samples into ranked
   categories of ecological condition within 18 communities, and
   means-tests and other techniques were used to identify ecological
   differences among ranks across vegetation types. With few exceptions,
   grass and forb cover, biological soil crust cover, and species diversity
   declined concomitant with ranks representing increasingly degraded
   conditions, while non-native species cover was variable among ranks.
   Landscape-level species abundance patterns also differed significantly
   among ranks, with herbaceous species generally exhibiting less constancy
   and cover within degraded samples compared to samples of reference
   quality. These semi-arid ecosystems will require both active (e.g.,
   reseeding) and passive (grazing management) restoration approaches, at
   local- and landscape-levels, respectively, if the goal is to restore
   native plant composition and abundance. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Aim To determine how the distribution and cover of different vegetation
   types are affected by physical factors and livestock in a mountain range
   with a long evolutionary history of grazing.
   Location Upper vegetation belt of the Cordoba mountains (1700-2800 m
   a.s.l., 31 degrees 34' S, 64 degrees 50' W) in central Argentina.
   Methods Using GIS, we analysed the relationships of plant cover types to
   physical features (physiography and topography) and indicators of
   accumulated livestock pressure (distance to human settlements and roads)
   through multinomial logistic regression. We predicted a present
   vegetation map which was validated with a real map. We then constructed
   two maps simulating minimum and maximum values of accumulated livestock
   pressure for the whole area. Map comparisons allowed evaluation of the
   possible influence of livestock, both in extension and intensity.
   Results Both physical features and livestock pressure influenced the
   occurrence of vegetation units. The overall accuracy of the predicted
   map at the pixel level was low (26\%) indicating low habitat specificity
   of the vegetation units. We suggest that some part of the unaccounted
   for variance was due to livestock pressure patterns that were not fully
   captured by our indicators. Our models proved adequate for predicting
   the total percentages of vegetation units at coarser scales. The
   extrapolations showed that under a history of low livestock pressure,
   such as in sites far away from human settlements and roads, the area
   would be dominated by woodlands, tussock grasslands and natural rock
   outcrops. Under a history of heavy livestock pressure, in turn, rock
   exposed by erosion, tussock grasslands and natural rock outcrops would
   dominate.
   Main conclusions Vegetation units showed low habitat specificity, and
   were associated with accumulated livestock pressure, indicating that
   livestock and its associated activities are important factors
   structuring the landscape and have important consequences for the
   integrity of the ecosystem. Results suggest that although this system
   evolved with large herbivores, it has experienced irreversible
   degradation processes, and intensification of current domestic livestock
   pressure is likely to lead to even more land degradation.}},

   in two periods, at the beginning and at the end of grazing period. Soil
   available nutrients (nitrate, ammonium, phosphorus, potassium, calcium
   and magnesium), total nitrogen, organic carbon and pH were measured.
   Plant chemical contents (protein, lignin and others) were significantly
   related to the proportions of grasses, legumes and other plants; so, the
   protein content is positively correlated with legumes plant biomass
   while lignin content is negatively correlated with grasses. Both plant
   and soil nutrients increased linearly towards the centre of the camping
   area. However, the relationship among plant species richness, diversity
   and evenness relative to its position along the studied transect was
   bell-shaped. From the outskirts to the centre of the camping area,
   plants with low nutrient demand were progressively replaced by those
   with medium and high nutrients demand and by pioneers.
   Nardus stricta-dominant pasture has low plant diversity and plant
   nutrient content as well as a poor soil nutrient availability. The
   presence of the camping area introduced patches with more soil nutrients
   and new species in the large spatial scale. However at a small spatial
   scale, the strong soil nutrient concentration into the centre of the
   camping area reduced floral composition again. To ensure positive
   effects of camping areas on plant diversity, and to manage more
   effectively the nutrients returned to the soil, a reduction in the
   stocking rate should be pursued.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation, patch quality and landscape structure are
   important predictors for species richness. However, conservation
   strategies targeting single species mainly focus on habitat patches and
   neglect possible effects of the surrounding landscape. This project
   assesses the impact of management, habitat fragmentation and landscape
   structure at different spatial scales on the distribution of three
   endangered butterfly species, Boloria selene, Boloria titania and
   Brenthis ino. We selected 36 study sites in the Swiss Alps differing in
   (1) the proportion of suitable habitat (i.e., wetlands); (2) the
   proportion of potential dispersal barriers (forest) in the surrounding
   landscape; (3) altitude; (4) habitat area and (5) management (mowing
   versus grazing). Three surveys per study site were conducted during the
   adult flight period to estimate occurrence and density of each species.
   For the best disperser B. selene the probability of occurrence was
   positively related to increasing proportion of wetland on a large
   spatial scale (radius: 4,000 m), for the medium disperser B. ino on an
   intermediate spatial scale (2,000 m) and for the poorest disperser B.
   titania on a small spatial scale (1,000 m). Nearby forest did not
   negatively affect butterfly species distribution but instead enhanced
   the probability of occurrence and the population density of B. titania.
   The fen-specialist B. selene had a higher probability of occurrence and
   higher population densities on grazed compared to mown fens. The
   altitude of the habitat patches affected the occurrence of the three
   species and increasing habitat area enhanced the probability of
   occurrence of B. selene and B. ino. We conclude that, the surrounding
   landscape is of relevance for species distribution, but management and
   habitat fragmentation are often more important. We suggest that
   butterfly conservation should not focus only on a patch scale, but also
   on a landscape scale, taking into account species-specific dispersal
   abilities.}},

Abstract = {{Soil organic matter is a relevant carbon reservoir and CO(2) sink in
   temperate grassland ecosystems and increased carbon uptake may mitigate
   climate change. Relatively little is known about the relationship
   between ecosystem function and soil fungal biodiversity in grasslands.
   However, this relationship is important because the saprotrophic
   microorganisms within the decomposer chain may, given their important
   role in the decomposition processes of litter and dead roots, control
   soil carbon storage. In this study, we provide the first empirical
   evidence of natural patterns of soil fungal biodiversity and soil carbon
   storage in Mediterranean grasslands at different elevations. We observed
   an asymptotic relationship between morphological and functional trait
   richness and fungal biodiversity. This relationship is consistent with
   the redundancy hypothesis of species diversity and ecosystem function. A
   limited number of fungal species is sufficient to attain morphological
   and functional variability in the soil fungal assemblages in these
   grasslands. We found that increasing fungal biodiversity and biochemical
   specialization were related to higher soil carbon storage (at a higher
   altitudes and lower slope position), even in fenced-off grasslands. We
   discuss the main ecological mechanisms controlling soil carbon storage
   in grasslands within the framework of a conceptual model.}},

Abstract = {{Pinus sylvestris L. and Pinus mugo Turra originating from two
   plantations established during the 1960s are invading subalpine
   heathlands higher than 1500 in above sea level in Montseny Natural Park
   (northeast Spain). Both species are native at a regional scale but may
   not have been present in the park's subalpine vegetation previously. In
   addition, Abies alba P. Mill., which is in regression in many areas in
   Europe, is also colonizing the area from a neighboring natural forest.
   This invasion appears to be stimulated by a combination of natural and
   human factors, including differences between vegetation components,
   climate (i.e., drought periods), changes in land use due to conservation
   policies (i.e., suppressing fire or grazing practices), the creation of
   the plantations, and probably the nurse role played by accompanying
   dwarf shrubs (Calluna vulgaris {[}L.] Hull and juniperus communis subsp.
   nana {[}Willd.] Syme). We examined the effects of this process in terms
   of the spatial dispersion and characteristics of the established
   conifers and deduce implications for the conservation of isolated
   subalpine pastures in Mediterranean Basin mountains. P. sylvestris was
   the most successful invading species in this area. The P. mugo invasion
   is distributed mainly near the plantation. The only native conifer
   species, A. alba, appears to be colonizing only the eastern slope. The
   invasion process is related to the diversity and species richness
   recorded on each slope. Conserving valuable subalpine heathlands at the
   latitude of the Montseny mountain range implies Suppressing propagule
   pressures from the plantations. The option of removing conifers that are
   normative, at a local scale, must be considered. However, in the case of
   the native A. alba this option leads to a management conflict between
   conserving former pastureland and the dispersion of A. alba.}},

   It is uncertain, however, how the effects of such interplay control

   that actively hunting spiders reduced plant species diversity and
   enhanced aboveground net primary production and nitrogen mineralization
   rate, whereas sit- and- wait ambush spiders had opposite effects. These
   effects arise from the different responses to the two different
   predators by their grasshopper prey- the dominant herbivore species that
   controls plant species composition and accordingly ecosystem
   functioning. Predator hunting mode is thus a key functional trait that
   can help to explain variation in the nature of top- down control of

   Location: Skealoghan turlough, County Mayo, Ireland.
   Methods: Percentage cover of vascular plants and bryophytes were

   collected. Data were analysed using multivariate statistical techniques.
   Results: A total of 69 species of vascular plants and mosses were
   recorded. Cluster analysis grouped the samples into two separate
   communities, the Cirsio-Molinietum and the Ranunculo-Potentilletum
   anserinae plant communities. The plant community composition and species
   richness followed a main gradient down into the turlough basin, but also
   varied with microtopography, resulting in a mosaic of vegetation types.
   Conclusions: The biodiversity and conservation value of the site is
   linked to the heterogeneity in its physical environment in which

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{113-124}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic disturbances of forest ecosystems are increasingly
   recognized as fundamental ecological processes with important long-term
   implications for biogeochemical cycles and vegetation patterns. This
   article aims at reconstructing the extent and intensity of the two most
   common types of traditional forest uses-forest litter collecting and
   wood pasture-in the Swiss Rhone valley (Valais) by (i) identifying the
   spatiotemporal patterns, and (ii) modeling the biomass removal through
   these practices. Detailed information on agricultural practices and
   socio-economic context were essential to develop reliable estimates of
   anthropogenic disturbance regimes. In the Valais, predominately goats
   and sheep grazed in the forests. The intensity of grazing was a function
   of the number of grazing animals and the available grazing area. Forest
   litter was used as bedding for farm animals during the winter. Key
   factors determining the intensity of litter collecting were the number
   of animal units, the amount of available substitute products (straw),
   and the area where litter raking could be practiced. The results show
   that wood pasture and forest litter collecting were practiced on a
   significant proportion of the forested landscape in the Valais up to the
   second half of the 20th century. Until the implementation of forest
   management plans in the 1930s, almost half of the forests in the study
   area were affected by wood pasture and/or forest litter collecting. The
   regulations in the management plans led to an essential reduction of the
   area available for these traditional practices but likewise to an
   increased pressure on the remaining areas. The results suggest that the
   notion of a slow but steady disappearance of traditional non-timber
   forest uses and the associated effects on forest ecosystems is
   oversimplified. Quantitative reconstructions of biomass output resulting
   from these practices confirm the importance of traditional non-timber
   forest uses for ecosystem development in this region. Furthermore, it is
   very likely that similar effects have been widespread throughout regions
   with similar natural and socio-economic context, for example, throughout
   a significant proportion of the European Alps. This study underlines the
   importance of environmental history for ecological sciences as well as
   for forest management and conservation planning.}},

Abstract = {{This research characterized the feeding ecology of the fish community of
   the upper-middle course of Paraitinga River, located within the Upper
   Tiete River Basin, a peculiar Atlantic Forest area, regarded as a
   hotspot for fish conservation. Considering the several anthropogenic
   modifications, knowledge of the trophic structure might contribute to a
   better understanding of the factors that maintain the present fish
   community. Fish were collected with electrofishing equipment at 16 sites
   with different riparian vegetation, including native forest, secondary
   forest, pasture, and Eucalyptus, during the dry and rainy season of
   2004/2005. Results obtained for 15 species indicated a predominance of
   insectivores and herbivore-detritivores along the course and an increase
   of total biomass, specifically of the herbivores-detritivores at the
   pasture sites, which seemed to be mediated by specific habitat features,
   which included open canopy, high water speed, and deeper areas.
   Strategies of resource use indicated that 47\% of total combination
   pairs showed high overlap, but competition seemed to be minimized
   through low co-occurrence, spatial segregation, and abundance of food
   resources. Niche width was broad for all species, with no significant
   differences occurring among sites, seasons, and upper and lower course.
   With regard to the ongoing modifications in riparian zone conditions in
   this area, the implications of these findings for regional biodiversity
   conservation are discussed.}},

Title = {{Vascular plant and Orthoptera diversity in relation to grassland

Abstract = {{1. Several recent studies have considered the relative effects of local
   vs. landscape factors on diversity of several animal taxa in grasslands.
   However, very few have considered vascular plant or Orthoptera species,
   both of which are important biotic components of grassland ecosystems.
   The general aim of this study was to determine the effect of grassland
   management and landscape composition, and their potential interactions,
   on diversity patterns of vascular plants and Orthoptera in Alpine hay
   meadows.
   2. We considered three groups of management regimes defined by different
   amounts of fertilizer nitrogen applied and cutting frequency: (i)
   extensive, (ii) low intensive and (iii) intensive meadows situated in
   different landscape contexts. To evaluate the relative importance of
   meadow management and landscape composition on diversity patterns, we
   applied analysis of covariance and variation partitioning analyses.
   3. Diversity patterns of both taxonomic groups were affected primarily
   by grassland management. The extensive management regime was most
   suitable for conserving high species richness of both taxonomic groups.
   The intensive meadows were characterized by plant communities dominated
   by a few ruderal and competitor species, and by Orthoptera communities
   composed of only a few abundant Caelifera species (e.g. Chorthippus
   parallelus), while Ensifera species had very low individual densities.
   4. Regarding the landscape determinants, plant diversity patterns were
   not significantly related to any landscape composition variables. In
   contrast, a high proportion of urban elements and grassland in the
   surrounding landscape (radius 500 m) affected Orthoptera species
   richness negatively.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The implementation of well-targeted
   agri-environment schemes for compensation payments against
   intensification and abandonment of extensive hay meadows seems to be a
   promising tool to protect both taxonomic groups. In this context, we
   suggest that the existing Swiss ecological compensation area (ECA) hay
   meadow agri-environment scheme, which requires at least one cut every
   year and no fertilizer application, might also be suitable for the
   Italian Alps. Moreover, the significant influence of landscape
   composition on Orthoptera diversity suggests that the effectiveness of
   measures applied at a field scale may be improved by integration of
   protected area schemes, promoting extensive management at a farm scale.}},

Title = {{Effects of pasture management on the natural regeneration of neotropical
   trees}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{371-380}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Natural regeneration of forest trees in grazed pastures could
   potentially contribute to the conservation of tree diversity within the
   fragmented and agricultural landscapes that dominate much of the
   tropics. To understand this potential, we evaluated the effects of
   several widely used pasture management practices on tree regeneration in
   pastures in a tropical dry forest (subhumid) region of central
   Nicaragua.
   2. Species richness, density, diversity and composition of seedlings,
   saplings and adult trees were compared in 46 pastures under different
   management conditions. The management conditions included three
   different types of grasses (Brachiaria spp., Cynodon spp. and
   naturalized pastures) and two categories of fire history (recently burnt
   and not recently burnt).
   3. Thirty-seven of the 85 tree species present in the pastures were
   regenerated under the current management conditions. The remaining 48
   species may have had reduced natural regeneration because of limitations
   in either germination, dispersal, establishment or growth, as well as
   because of negative effects of pasture management practices.
   4. The richness, density and species composition of tree seedlings
   within pastures were explained by grass species composition, the density
   and richness of adult trees, cattle management and the distance of the
   pasture to forest. In contrast, no clear effect of fire history was
   found.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Current management practices allow the
   regeneration of almost half of the tree species in grazed pastures.
   However, to enhance the regeneration of species that show limited
   regeneration, management strategies, such as the retention of adult
   trees, protection of saplings and seedlings from weeding and grazing and
   use of enrichment plantings, may be necessary. These changes in pasture
   management would help contribute to the long-term conservation of tree
   diversity within agricultural landscapes across the tropics.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{611-624}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In the southern Great Plains of North America, fire exclusion has
   contributed to many rangelands converting from native grassland to woody
   shrublands dominated by mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.) and cactus
   (Opuntia spp.), threatening ecosystem health and human livelihoods in
   the region. Prescribed fire is the least expensive method of treating
   mesquite and other undesirable plants, but its role is as a maintenance
   treatment to prolong the life of more expensive brush control
   treatments. Using a simulation model of a hypothetical 1000 ha ranch, we
   evaluate the biological and economic implications of management
   scenarios involving the regular application of summer fire to reduce
   mesquite and cactus over a 30-year time period. We compared the model
   output with experimental data to corroborate model output before
   evaluating various management scenarios over a range of stocking rates.
   Scenarios included (a) varying initial range condition, (b) different
   frequencies of summer burning, and (c) different initial amounts of
   mesquite brush. Model simulations corroborated field data sufficiently
   well to give confidence in the output of the model. in our simulations
   the option of not treating to reduce brush and cactus had a major
   negative impact on range condition, secondary productivity and
   profitability. In contrast, all simulated fire treatments improved range
   condition, productivity and profitability except when initial range
   condition was poor. Initial range condition and stocking rate were the
   major factors affecting both productivity and profitability. Compared to
   other factors over which managers have short-term control, frequency of
   burning and the initial amount of mesquite cover, had a relatively minor
   impact. Simulations indicated that the highest level of profit
   consistent with maintaining or improving range condition was attained
   when individual animal production was 92-95\% that of the maximum
   production per animal, a situation invariably associated with relatively
   low stocking rates. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This four-year study investigated whether partitioning intensively

   dominated by Elymus repens. Cut strips contained more species than the
   grass crop but most were generalists or woody species. A few
   semi-natural species were present in non-experimental field margins
   bordering the grass crop fields, but few colonized the strips. Setting
   aside non-fertilized strips is not sufficient to increase plant species
   richness; further management, e. g., annual cutting and removal of plant
   material is required. Strips created on fertile soils may be a poor
   habitat for several semi-natural species and are not likely to

Abstract = {{Creation of permanent, semi-natural strips may contribute to increased
   plant diversity in agricultural areas if they function as habitats for
   new species. Non-fertilized strips that were ploughed and either unsown
   or sown with a grass and meadow herb seed mixture were created in a
   grass crop field, in order to test the establishment of several meadow
   herb species, to investigate to what extent creation of sown and unsown
   strips increased plant species numbers and the number of meadow herbs,
   and to assess the contribution of species dispersal from an adjacent
   semi-natural field margin into the created strips. The strips were cut
   each autumn and plant material removed. Plant species composition was
   studied in permanent quadrats in the strips and in the surrounding grass
   crop during four years. Four of the 22 sown meadow herb species did not
   establish in the strips. Sowing increased both the number of meadow
   herbs and plant species diversity (calculated by the Shannon index)
   compared with the grass crop. Creating unsown strips did not increase
   the number of meadow herbs or plant species diversity. The created
   strips were colonized by woody species originating from the adjacent
   semi-natural field margin, but the meadow herbs present in the field
   margin did not colonize the strips. In the short term, establishment of
   sown strips would improve biodiversity locally. However, such strips
   will not serve as suitable habitats for the most vulnerable meadow
   herbs, and thus creation of new strips cannot compensate for loss of
   existing species-rich, semi-natural habitats.}},

Abstract = {{We provide an overview of the amount and ecological condition of wooded
   meadows throughout Estonia after significant changes in agriculture in
   the second part of 20th century. We also present the first attempt to
   estimate the success of recent conservation efforts for wooded meadows.
   Our analysis is based on recent exhaustive inventories. We found that
   Estonia, despite a decrease of the area in. wooded meadows by two orders
   of magnitude during the 20th century, still has about 8400 ha remaining
   of which approximately 5900 ha are meadows with, at the least, an
   intermediate conservation value. The latter is directly dependent on
   mowing regime. Efforts to preserve wooded meadows include establishment
   of protected areas and financial support for mowing. The national
   conservation subsidy has been useful and supportive for wooded meadows,
   however the total amount of this subsidy has been small compared to the
   area that could be Supported. The much larger funds of
   agri-environmental subsidies have largely not been available for wooded
   meadows. Moreover, there has been no record keeping about subsidisation
   of semi-natural grasslands using agricultural support schemes. Although
   the preservation of some good examples of wooded meadows in Estonia
   seems guaranteed, further degradation of this valuable habitat type on a
   national scale is very probable.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, 119 meadows distributed across the Yorkshire Dales
   National Park were re-surveyed and changes in the overall vegetation and
   the landscape structure over the last two decades were investigated with
   a particular emphasis on the influence of management practices. To study
   the effects of fragmentation on a particular species, this study focused
   on changes in the occurrence of the perennial herb Geranium sylvaticurn
   as this is accepted as an indicator of the good ecological condition of
   British upland hay meadows.
   Results indicated that there has been a general impoverishment in the
   vegetation with a decrease in diversity, species richness and habitat
   quality and meadows have become 10 times more isolated than 20 years
   ago. Habitat quality was positively associated with agri-environment
   schemes that encourage extensive management practices, low grazing
   intensity and organic fertiliser application. G. sylvaticum has
   disappeared from 40\% of the fields where it used to be and its
   occurrence was influenced by habitat quality and the connectivity of the
   fields in 2003.
   For perennial plants that do not have specialised reproduction and
   dispersal mechanisms like G. sylvaticum, changes at the local scale may
   have stronger effects on survival than changes at the wider landscape
   scale. It is thus of utmost importance to maintain and encourage
   traditional management practices in remaining hay meadows, especially
   hay making practices that would facilitate the exchange of seeds between
   fields and improve landscape connectivity. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Adult grasshopper species richness and abundance were determined using
   sweep-net samplings during a 3-year study, in an incomplete design
   experiment based on the management of two goat breeds (Cashmere and
   Celtiberic) and two stocking densities (high and low) in the case of
   Cashmere breed. Shrub cover and plant canopy height decreased with
   increasing grazing pressure, leading to higher herbaceous plant cover
   compared to the low stocking density. Cashmere and Celtiberic goats
   induced different vegetation dynamics, with the latter causing a higher
   reduction of shrub cover and a higher increase of dead matter and
   herbaceous plant cover than Cashmere grazing.
   A significant grasshopper response to the vegetation alterations induced
   by grazing at local-scale was observed. The higher stocking densities
   increased total grasshopper density, but this was attained almost
   exclusively by one species, Stenobothrus stigmaticus. The other
   grasshopper species seemed to be favoured by the lower grazing
   intensity. Shrub and dead matter cover, total plant biomass and species
   richness were the most important plant variables explaining the
   responses of grasshoppers to the different grazing managements. The
   management of different grazing pressures could be recommended to
   diversify the ecological characteristics and thus the resources for
   grasshoppers in heathlands. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates three treatment methods to establish field
   margins of high botanical and invertebrate diversity within an
   intensively managed grassland system. Field margin treatments were:
   fenced only, rotavated and allowed to regenerate naturally, reseeded
   with a grass and wildflower seed mixture. Control plots were unfenced
   and grazed. Field margin widths were established at 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 m.
   The botanical composition of the plots was examined on four occasions
   between 2002 and 2004 using permanent nested quadrats. Emergence traps
   were installed in each of the treatments to investigate invertebrate
   abundance response to treatment. Results showed that (1) reseeding had a
   positive effect on resultant botanical diversity when compared with
   other establishment treatments investigated, (2) natural regeneration
   after rotavation could not be recommended as an effective means of
   restoring diversity under these environmental conditions, due to the
   abundance of undesirable weed species, (3) exclusion of fertiliser
   inputs alone resulted in a very slow change in the botanical
   composition, (4) width of plot did not have a significant influence on

Journal = {{ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{228-241}},
Abstract = {{Prescribed fire is used to reduce woody plant and cactus cover and
   restore degraded rangelands in the southern Great Plains, but little is
   known regarding the impact of summer fires. We evaluated the effects of
   summer fires applied as patch burns in continuously grazed rangeland in
   north Texas. Vegetation and soil responses were measured on patches
   burned within grazing units in the summers of 1998, 1999, and 2000
   relative to that on adjacent unburned control areas in the same grazing
   units. Annual rainfall during the study was below average for six burns
   (1998 and 1999) and average or above for three burns (2000). If average
   rainfall preceded and followed summer burning, degradation was limited
   to a modest increase in bare ground which recovered to exceed unburned
   control levels within 2 years. However, when drought conditions preceded
   and followed burning, there was an increase in bare ground and the
   proportion of annual forbs and annual grasses at the expense of
   perennial grasses. These areas took 3-5 years to recover. Areas burned
   in any year did not recover until after a season of favorable
   precipitation. The degree of degradation was proportional to the
   severity of drought conditions. The fires reduced the cover of honey
   mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa Torr.), other shrubs and cactus (Opuntia
   spp.), which facilitated herbaceous recovery, mitigating the negative
   impacts of burning in summer and the increased herbivory on the burned
   patches. Increases in herbaceous species composition were positively
   related to woody plant and cactus reduction following fire treatment.
   Results suggest that summer burning may be an effective and low-cost
   means of controlling problem plants, increasing pasture heterogeneity,
   and reducing herbivore impact on intensively grazed patches. However,
   before the practice of summer burning can be advocated, research needs
   to determine if post-burn deferment will facilitate more rapid recovery
   through regulating herbivory after burning to increase the recovery of
   litter and herbaceous cover and restore desired herbaceous species
   composition and production.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{56}},

Pages = {{461-468}},
Abstract = {{Grasslands in the Riverina region of south-eastern Australia have long
   been thought to be derived from woodland dominated by Acacia pendula A.
   Cunn. ex G. Don and Atriplex nummularia Lindl. following over-grazing
   and clearing in the 19th Century. Despite the broad acceptance of this
   view, there is little evidence for such a universal change having
   occurred. Phytosociological and historical evidence is presented here,
   which suggests that, although many of the existing grassland remnants
   are floristically similar to remnants of A. pendula woodland and are
   probably derived from woodland, natural treeless grassland also probably
   occurs in the Riverina. Such grassland is floristically distinct from
   remnant woodland and generally spatially separate, being prevalent in
   the southern Riverina. Although the delineation of natural and derived
   grassland boundaries may now be difficult, grassland vegetation in
   general is of immense biodiversity significance, containing a large
   number of highly localised rare or threatened species. A decrease in
   rainfall during the winter and spring growing season, as predicted by
   climate-change models, may be detrimental to natural grassland, which is
   restricted to the higher rainfall portion of the Riverina.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{224-232}},
Abstract = {{Grazing and competition are two main factors shaping range plant
   communities; however, few studies have investigated their interaction.
   The current study aimed to investigate the effects of defoliation,
   competition and their interaction on production of annual grasses in
   semiarid Mediterranean areas. Competition treatments (absence/presence
   of neighbors) were combined with three defoliation intensities (0\%,
   30\% and 60\%) in a complete factorial design. Competition significantly
   reduced grass biomass. However, the role of competition was eliminated
   under heavy defoliation or under dry growth conditions. Defoliation
   showed variable results on final biomass (FB) and cumulative biomass
   (CB). While heavy defoliation (60\% clipping intensity) reduced grass FB
   down to 80\% during the two growing seasons, light defoliation (30\%)
   significantly increased CB. Results showed that competition may limit
   the direct effect of defoliation on dominant grass species. Further, the
   relationship between site productivity and competition effect was best
   explained by a negative linear model. This hypothesized model may
   suggest that facilitation and competition alternatively affect grassland
   communities along a productivity gradient. The results suggest that
   light grazing may sustain or even enhance grassland productivity. The
   results also indicated the suitability of annual grass species to
   re-vegetate degraded rangeland in semi-arid climate. Further, optimum
   grazing practices to conserve biodiversity of Avena grassland may
   involve moderate stocking rate. (C) 2007 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

Abstract = {{Heathlands are severely threatened by decreasing habitat quantity and

   plant diversity. Therefore, the aims of this study were to investigate
   the effects of management and adjacent forest land use on the heathland

   bryophyte species were studied.
   Bryophyte communities of 11 dry heathland patches bordering forest were
   surveyed. In these heathlands, management turned out to be an important
   factor explaining community composition of bryophytes. Furthermore,
   significant effects of adjacent land use on bryophyte community
   composition and species richness were found. However, these effects were
   rather limited in extent, occurring only close to habitat borders, i.e.,
   up to maximum 5 m into the heathland patch. Also for individual
   bryophyte species, effects of adjacent forest could only be observed
   within maximum 5m from the edge. One remarkable edge effect was the
   increased dominance of the invasive species Campylopus introflexus near
   the forest edge, especially at grazed sites. Effects of adjacent land
   use seemed to predominate management effects. Consequently, management
   cannot serve as a tool to mitigate edge effects on bryophyte species in

   landscape controls}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{365-372}},
Abstract = {{Habitat type and quality are recognised as important local determinants
   of species richness, but other processes operating at the landscape
   scale can also affect diversity patterns. The evidence regarding the
   relative importance of landscape context on vascular plants is diverse,
   and little is known about the effects of this complex factor in Alpine
   environments. Hence, the primary purpose of the study was to elucidate
   the relative effects of the determinants of plant species richness by
   decomposing the variation into local and landscape components. We
   sampled 99 hay meadows in the Italian Alps, and recorded 14 explanatory
   variables ascribed to three sets: two sets of local variables, meadow
   management and abiotic environment, and a set of landscape variables.
   Plant diversity was affected primarily by local determinants. Species
   richness tended to increase in less fertilised meadows, confirming the
   detrimental effect of intensive meadow management on plant diversity.
   Site conditions such as steep slopes also enhanced plant species
   richness, showing a most pronounced positive effect in meadows that were
   cut less frequently. As to the landscape determinants, a high proportion
   of urban elements affected species richness negatively probably due to
   further eutrophication. In contrast, an increased length of meadow edges
   had a positive effect, particularly in meadows located on shallow soils.
   Partitioning analyses revealed that the three sets of variables. showed
   relatively large shared effects with each other (over half of the total
   variation explained). In conclusion, the composition of the surrounding
   landscape had a lower impact on vascular plant species richness than did
   meadow management and local abiotic environment. (C) 2007 Gesellschaft

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{626-634}},
Abstract = {{Understanding patterns of vascular plant diversity in managed temperate
   grasslands and the processes that determine them requires analyses at
   multiple spatial scales. In this study, we applied additive partitioning
   to plant species richness data of two contrasting management regimes
   (meadow vs. pasture) collected from a nested sampling design that
   consisted of two hierarchical scales. At the local scale, we quantified
   additive diversity components in 180 vegetation plots, and at the
   regional scale 60 grassland parcels. Total observed regional species
   richness (gamma(r)) was partitioned into its additive components within
   (alpha(1)) and among vegetation plots (beta(1)) mid among, grassland
   parcels, (beta(r)). We used the same approach in a comparison of common
   and infrequent plant species. Partitioning analyses revealed that the
   relative contributions of diversity components to total observed
   regional species richness changed as a function of spatial scale. We
   found that species richness among grassland parcels (beta(r)) of both
   meadows and pastures contributed most to total observed regional species
   richness of all and infreqent plant species (up to 81\% and 96\%,
   respectively), whereas for common species only up to 51\% of gamma(r)
   were attributable to species richness among grassland parcels (beta(r)).
   To gain insight into the processes that may affect local patterns of
   species richness in grasslands, we analysed the observed local species
   diversity components with respect to management regime, nitrogen
   fertilisation and abiotic environmental factors (slope angle and soil
   quality). Our results show that grazing at a low-to-moderate stocking
   density promotes the beta-diversity of all plant species at the local
   scale due to increased within-habitat heterogeneity. Low application

Abstract = {{Grassland is a valuable habitat for many farmland bird species, some of
   which have declined in Europe. Successful management of this habitat is
   important to benefit these species. Recent studies have suggested little
   correlation between food abundance and bird use in grasslands instead
   providing access to food may be crucial. We tested the importance of
   manipulating sward height (via mowing) on the distribution of wintering
   birds in agriculturally managed grass fields using two within-field
   experimental designs. In experiment 1, we investigated the effect of two
   treatments (mown once and control). In experiment 2. we investigated the
   effects of four treatments (mown once early. mown once late. mown early
   and late. and control).
   Mown plots supported higher abundances of foraging kestrels, thrushes
   mid starlings. In contrast meadow pipits and grey herons preferred
   unmown plots with longer grass. These differences are probably explained
   by differing anti-predation strategies, increased food abundance for
   species that prefer above-ground invertebrates (e.g. more food for
   rneadow pipits on longer swards) and increased food accessibility, on
   short grass swards (e.g. for starling, thrush spp.). There were limited
   effects of multiple mowing events on plot use suggesting one early
   winter mowing, treatment may suffice to create favourable conditions for
   species that prefer shorter swards.
   Providing grassland heterogeneity should benefit a range of wintering
   farmland birds. Although we use mowing to change grass sward height, our
   findings may also apply at other times of year when livestock grazing
   may be a more practical solution. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier GmbH on

Abstract = {{Over the past 100 years species-rich semi-natural grasslands have
   decreased dramatically in Western Europe, where former arable fields
   (ex-fields) are used instead as pasture. The disappearance of
   semi-natural grasslands has caused a threat to the biodiversity in
   agricultural landscapes. Many typical grassland plants are dispersal
   limited, thus grazed ex-fields can be used to investigate if species
   spontaneously colonise these new grassland habitats. We examined the
   relationship between surrounding landscape, field area, shape, distance
   between edge and Centre, and plant species diversity in ex-fields that
   had been grazed for 15 - 18 years. The results showed that there were
   35\% more plant species in fields surrounded by commercial forestry
   production compared to those surrounded by open agricultural landscape.
   Area and shape did not influence species richness, although there was
   increasing number of species in the Centre with decreasing distance from
   the edge. Twenty-five percent of the species where typical grassland
   species, and ex-fields surrounded by forest had 91\% more grassland
   species compared to those in the open landscape. It is possible to
   increase grassland plant occurrences by grazing ex-fields surrounded by
   forest or other grassland remnant habitats, particularly in landscapes
   where grazed semi-natural grasslands are scarce. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Lately there has been a shift in Sweden from grazing species-rich
   semi-natural grasslands towards grazing ex-arable fields in the modern
   agricultural landscape. These fields normally contain a fraction of the
   plant species richness compared to semi-natural grasslands. However,
   small remnant habitats have been suggested as important for plant
   species diversity and conservation as they may function as refugia for
   grassland specialists in fragmented and highly modified agricultural
   landscapes. In this study, we examined whether plant communities on
   small remnant habitats, i.e. midfield islets, can function as sources
   for grassland species to disperse out into surrounding grazed ex-fields
   (former arable fields). We examined species richness and grassland
   specialists (species favoured by grazing) and their ability to colonize
   fields after 5 and 11 years of grazing. The fields that had been grazed
   for a shorter time were fairly species-poor with few grassland
   specialists. A longer period of grazing had a positive effect on total
   and small-scale species diversity in both islets and fields. Species
   composition became more similar with time, and the number of grassland
   specialists in both habitats increased. We found that grassland
   specialists dispersed step-wise into the fields, and the number of
   grassland specialists decreased with distance from the source. Our study
   suggests that remnant habitats, such as midfield islets, do function as
   a source community for grassland specialists and enhance diversification
   of grassland species when grazing is introduced. For long-term
   conservation of plant species, incorporating small refugia. into larger
   grazing complexes may thus enhance species richness. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The topsoil is one of the most important components in grassland and
   sustains the sward physically, chemically and biologically. Farmers
   often refer to the soil-sward-animal complex or interrelations to
   underline the fact that the proper functionings of all three are
   inextricably linked. Grazing has a favourable effect on animals -
   however, grazing also has a major effect on the plant stock of pastured
   grasslands. Sheep do not feed plants from urine patches, which may
   result in a change in the diversity of plants on the pasture. One of the
   aims of our research was to examine the effect of animal excreta
   coverage on grassland biodiversity improvement. The research took place
   on nature conservation grassland areas, pasturing ewes. We analyzed the
   effect of urine induced lush patches on sustaining the diversity of
   plant species. Results showed that lush patches were grazed unevenly.
   The outer circle, app. 15\% of the patches has been grazed, a further
   15-20\% has been somewhat grazed, while the middle of the patch, 60-70\%
   remained ungrazed. In the first growth, grass species in the middle of
   the lush patch seed heads (40-150 patch(-1)) while on the outer edge of
   the patch, rhizomatous plants advanced..
   The diversity of species on grasslands can be sustained by grazing.
   Nongrazed area and generative tiller number indicate that grazed nature
   conservation pastures are able to renew themselves through a generative
   way, as an indirect effect of grazing.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{172}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Historical land claim of coastal salt marshes in eastern England
   resulted in the development of grazing marshes, many of which were
   Subsequently converted to arable fanning. Their ditches support a rich
   variety of macrophyte species, due to subtle changes in water chemistry
   and hydroperiod. Macrophytes were surveyed in 36 shallow
   freshwater/brackish marsh ditches in eastern England during
   spring/summer 2000 to determine the relationships between environmental
   factors, agricultural activities (grazing or arable land use), and
   macrophyte diversity. Pasture site ditches supported a higher number of
   species (21) than arable ditches (8). Principle Components Analysis
   (PCA) for environmental variables associated pasture ditches with higher
   sediment ash-free dry weight (AFDW) and lower orthophosphate
   concentration and salinity. TWINSPAN classification grouped the
   submerged species Callitriche stagnalis, Ceratophyllum demersum,
   Ranunculus peltatus, R. aquatilis, Myriophyllum spicatum, and
   Potamogeton crispus into pasture ditch sites while the emergent species
   Phragmites australis and Scirpus maritimus were dominant in arable
   ditches. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) for all environmental
   variables analyzed showed that macrophyte distribution was strongly
   related to salinity, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and sediment
   AFDW, which differed between pasture and arable sites. Increases in
   salinity and decreases ill AFDW were associated with decreasing species
   richness (e.g. submerged and floating species). The growth of two
   submerged macrophytes (C. demersum and C. stagnalis) was studied in
   transplant experiments over three months in ditches at opposite ends of
   the TWINSPAN classification. In pasture ditches both species showed
   significant net biomass increment, whereas in arable ditches plants had
   significantly lower growth rates, with reduced biomass in some ditches.
   Macrophyte net biomass was predicted by a combination of salinity, water
   depth and water Column Chl-a. Experimentally, salinity above 3 ppt
   significantly reduced the net growth of C. stagnalis, although C.
   demersum grew in salinities up to 5 ppt, above which leaf damage and
   necrosis occurred. Salinity up to 6 ppt was detected in at-able ditches
   and was highly negatively correlated with water depth. Results suggest
   that ditches flora is affected in various ways based on surrounding land
   use. Salinity control by increased freshwater input and reduction of
   nutrient load are important factors in maintaining diversity of
   macrophyte assemblages.}},

Title = {{The rare butterfly Tomares nesimachus (Lycaenidae) as a bioindicator for
   pollination services and ecosystem functioning in northern Israel}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that insects whose existence depends on fruit
   production may serve as good bioindicators, especially for pollination
   services. In this study we examined this hypothesis, focusing on one of
   Israel's rarest butterflies, Tomares nesimachus (Rhopalocera;
   Lycaen-idae). The butterfly is affiliated with open grasslands in the
   north of Israel, where its sole host plant, Astragalus macrocarpus,
   occurs. In a two-year field study, we mapped the distribution of the
   butterfly in Israel and tried to evaluate the causes of its rarity and
   decline. We found that its abundance in habitat patches was correlated
   with several factors, including (a) fruit production of the host plants
   in each patch, (b) the number of other patches in the vicinity, (c) the
   characteristics of the ``matrix{''} outside the patches within a
   distance of up to 2 km, (d) the richness of large bee species (the plant
   pollinators), and (e) the grazing management of the butterfly's habitat.
   The characteristics of the matrix further affected the richness of bees
   in the butterfly's habitat. Since butterfly abundance is correlated with
   species richness of pollinators, it can serve as an indicator of
   diverse, species-rich butterfly habitats (grasslands). We deduce that
   spccies that depend on fruit production and by themselves do not
   contribute to their host-plant pollination, may almost necessarily be
   affected by multiple ecological factors and therefore can indeed serve
   as good indicators. Our results further indicate that the butterfly's
   population dynamics are affected by large-scale processes, and hence its
   conservation requires the preservation of large open landscapes.
   Consequently, T nesimachus may also serve as an umbrella species.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands of the Swiss Alps provide agricultural goods, ecological
   services, disaster protection, and scenic beauty. We identified
   influences of site conditions and management type on grassland
   biodiversity, and specifically evaluated the effectiveness of the
   agri-environmental programme in the Alps. Vascular plants and
   grasshoppers were mapped in conventionally managed cut meadows, cut
   meadows of the ecological compensation programme (ECA meadows), and
   conventionally managed pastures (n = 324). We determined climatic and
   topographic site conditions, quantified the degree of remoteness of all
   plots in GIS, and estimated the habitat diversity in the vicinity of the
   sampling sites. The data were analysed by discriminant analysis,
   rank-correlation analysis, non-parametric ANOVA, general linear models,
   and ANCOVA. Plant biodiversity hot spots were in economically
   unattractive, remote sites. These were the typical site conditions of
   ECA meadows. Hence we concluded that the ecological compensation
   programme was effectively ensuring management at these sites, and thus
   protecting mountain grassland plant species richness. Grasshoppers
   seemed not to benefit from mountain ECA meadows, which were probably
   often situated at the climatic limit of several species. Pastures were
   the most species rich management type (plants and grasshoppers), but
   conversion from cut grassland to pastures should be limited, as negative
   economic and ecological effects have been reported. We propose that the
   co-existence of well-managed pastures and long-term ECA meadows might
   best conserve mountain grassland biodiversity. (C) 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

Journal = {{JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{175-185}},
Abstract = {{Unimproved neutral grasslands have declined in extent throughout Europe,
   especially in Britain. Some of the surviving fragments are managed as
   pasture but the grazing regime required to maintain their relict flora
   is unproven. We conducted a systematic review and analysed available
   data to ascertain the impact of grazing on species richness and the
   abundance of important plant species. We found the evidence base to be
   poor but with some potential for meaningful integration of existing
   datasets. Analyses of complementary datasets from Welsh mesotrophic
   grassland demonstrates that livestock type and vegetation height
   significantly impact on the plant community composition. However, the
   differences in species richness and forb abundance between livestock
   types are not ecologically significant, and grazing intensity appears to
   be more important than species of grazer. Managers must balance changes
   in bryophyte abundance, forb diversity and plant species richness to
   achieve tradeoffs appropriate to their conservation objectives. The poor
   evidence base necessitates flexible, site-based management and rigorous
   monitoring where grazing of important mesotrophic pastures is
   undertaken. Further evidence regarding interactions between grazing
   intensity and livestock type is noticeably lacking, precluding
   prediction regarding livestock type impacts at given stocking
   intensities. Lack of detailed knowledge of land-use history is a major
   impediment and there is little information regarding taxa other than
   vascular plants. (c) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In natural systems, insect diversity and abundance are often positively
   correlated with plant diversity; however, these relationships may be
   obscured or complicated by other characteristics of plant communities
   that influence insect distributions. For example, diversity and
   abundance of insects may also be related to structural complexity,
   nutrition, or productivity of plants. In and systems, primary production
   is generally enhanced by supplemental moisture, which may provide food
   resources of greater abundance and quality for herbivores, resulting in
   greater insect diversity and abundance. Although the association of
   insect distributions with sites of either high plant diversity or
   productivity has been studied extensively, the relative importance of
   these two factors in influencing insect diversity and abundance remains
   unclear. We examined how insect communities in sagebrush steppe
   responded to two plant community treatments (a crested wheatgrass
   monoculture and a diverse community of native shrubs, grasses, and
   forbs) and three irrigation regimes (summer irrigation, fall/spring
   irrigation, and ambient precipitation only) on an experimental site
   designed to test protective cap designs for isolating buried hazardous
   waste. In both 2000 and 2001, insect diversity and abundance were
   positively correlated with both plant diversity and irrigation early in
   the summer; however, by the end of the summer, insect distributions were
   more strongly influenced by irrigation treatment. Our results suggest
   that during the dry season in this semi-arid shrub-steppe system, plant
   diversity may be secondary to moisture effects in influencing insect
   distributions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Atmosphere, ecology and evolution: what drove the Miocene expansion of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{35-45}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{1. Grasses using the C-4 photosynthetic pathway dominate today's savanna
   ecosystems and account for similar to 20\% of terrestrial carbon
   fixation. However, this dominant status was reached only recently,
   during a period of C-4 grassland expansion in the Late Miocene and Early
   Pliocene (4-8 Myr ago). Declining atmospheric CO2 has long been
   considered the key driver of this event, but new geological evidence
   casts doubt on the idea, forcing a reconsideration of the environmental
   cues for C-4 plant success.
   2. Here, I evaluate the current hypotheses and debate in this field,
   beginning with a discussion of the role of CO2 in the evolutionary
   origins, rather than expansion, of C-4 grasses. Atmospheric CO2
   starvation is a plausible selection agent for the C-4 pathway, but a
   time gap of around 10 Myr remains between major decreases in CO2 during
   the Oligocene, and the earliest current evidence Of C-4 plants.
   3. An emerging ecological perspective explains the Miocene expansion of
   C-4 grasslands via changes in climatic seasonality and the occurrence of
   fire. However, the climatic drivers of this event are debated and may
   vary among geographical regions.
   4. Uncertainty in these areas could be reduced significantly by new
   directions in ecological research, especially the discovery that grass
   species richness along rainfall gradients shows contrasting patterns in
   different C-4 clades. By re-evaluating a published data set, I show that
   increasing seasonality of rainfall is linked to changes in the relative
   abundance of the major C-4 grass clades Paniceae and Andropogoneae. I
   propose that the explicit inclusion of these ecological patterns would
   significantly strengthen climate change hypotheses of Miocene C-4
   grassland expansion. Critically, they allow a new series of testable
   predictions to be made about the fossil record.
   5. Synthesis. This paper offers a novel framework for integrating modern
   ecological patterns into theories about the geological history of C-4
   plants.}},

Abstract = {{In the last German breeding area of the rapidly declining
   ``Pomeranian{''} population of the Aquatic Warbler (Acrocephalus
   paludicola), the Lower Oder Valley National Park, we investigated
   changes in habitat suitability between 1993 and 2006 by combining
   monitoring results with repeated assessments of vegetation structure and
   composition, site conditions, and land use. Sites with recent Aquatic
   Warbler records showed shorter and sparser vegetation, a thinner litter
   layer, and a higher total plant species richness and cover of small and
   least competitive (CSR) species than abandoned or unoccupied sites. On a
   long-term study plot, during a period of late mowing and subsequent
   cessation of land use, vegetation height increased, the cover of CSR
   species decreased, and the site became abandoned by Aquatic Warblers.
   The probability of Aquatic Warbler occurrence was dependent on elevation
   and increased with the proportion of early mown or grazed area in the
   preceding year, with early use being most important on slightly higher
   elevated sites. This rapid deterioration of eutrophic habitats by
   delayed or discontinued land use is atypical for the majority of Aquatic
   Warbler breeding habitats. We conclude that both late or no land use and
   land use during the breeding season negatively affect the Pomeranian
   breeding sites and that a more sophisticated and flexible land
   management is urgently needed.}},

   regeneration and more targeted application of fertiliser. Three of the
   strategies are profitable and also contribute substantially to the
   condition of native vegetation and to the ecosystem services it
   provides. The strategies are not as profitable as traditional pasture
   improvement, historically the main source of increased wealth. However,
   the availability of alternative strategies greatly reduces the

Abstract = {{Examining edge effects is imperative to developing effective

   are a key component of how landscape change influences habitat quality.
   Although medium- to large-bodied mammals are recognised as key
   components of tropical forests, their responses to forest edges remain
   poorly documented. Here, we describe how five species of medium- to
   large-bodied terrestrial neotropical mammals respond to forest-pasture
   edges along 17 forest patches (ranging in size from 5-4714 ha) and two
   continuous areas of Amazonian forest in Alta Floresta, Brazil. Tracks
   from two rodent (Dasyprocta agouti and Agouti paca) and three ungulate
   species (Tayassu tajacu, Mazama gouazoubira and Tapirus terrestris) were
   recorded over 4900 sand track station nights during a 4-month study
   period. When species occurrences were compared between patch size
   classes we found a significant interaction between patch size and

Title = {{Seagrass structural complexity and landscape configuration as
   determinants of tropical fish assemblage composition}},
Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{363}},
Pages = {{241-255}},
Abstract = {{Seagrass meadows are regularly used by fish as resident, transient, or
   nursery habitat. However, there is a long-standing debate on how spatial
   variability of seagrass fish assemblages is determined. We examined the
   influence of seagrass structural complexity, physical water conditions,
   and proximity of neighboring shallow-water habitats on tropical fish
   assemblage composition in a shallow seagrass-dominated embayment at
   Zanzibar Island in the western Indian Ocean. Sampling of fish
   assemblages was carried out in seagrass meadows dominated by Enhalus
   acoroides or Thalassia hemprichii (3 localities each), 1 mixed meadow,
   and 1 unvegetated area. Overall, the density and biomass of fish were
   dominated by juvenile and subadult herbivores, either stationary
   seagrass residents or fish associated with coral reef and seagrass
   habitats. In terms of number of fish species, the majority were either
   carnivorous or omnivorous, and mainly coral-seagrass-associated.
   Multiple regression analysis indicated that canopy height was the
   foremost predictor for density, biomass, and species richness of
   juvenile fish, whereas adult and subadult fish densities were predicted
   by water depth. Moreover, distance-based correlation analyses revealed
   that fish assemblage structure was significantly correlated with the
   distance to neighboring mangrove and coral-reef habitats, shoot density,
   and (although weaker) canopy height. Based on these findings, attributes
   of seagrass structure and the location of a seagrass habitat within the
   seascape context appear to be important determinants of spatial patterns
   and variability of seagrass fish assemblages. This kind of information
   is important for spatial coastal management and for the selection of
   marine protected areas.}},

Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{57-66}},
Abstract = {{Small isolated patches of native forest surrounded by extensive pastoral
   grasslands, characteristic of many New Zealand rural landscapes,
   represent an important reservoir of lowland biodiversity. Improved
   management of them is a major focus of biodiversity conservation
   initiatives in New Zealand. We quantified the long-term impacts of
   grazing on indigenous forest remnants in hill country at Whatawhata,
   western Waikato, North Island. Structure and composition were compared
   between forest fragments grazed for >50 years and nearby ungrazed
   continuous forest. Grazed fragments had shorter and less shady canopies,
   sparser understoreys, tree populations with larger mean diameters, and
   ground layers with lower cover of litter and higher cover of vegetation
   and bare soil than continuous forest. Fragments also had lower
   indigenous-plant species richness, especially in sapling and seedling
   populations, and almost no palatable indigenous shrubs, terrestrial
   orchids, and ferns that require high humidity (e.g. Hymenophyllum spp.),
   but contained many indigenous and adventive herbaceous species. A
   transition appears to be occurring in grazed fragments from tall,
   long-lived trees like Beilschmiedia tawa and Dysoxylum spectabile to
   short and shorter-lived trees like Kunzea ericoides, Melicytus
   ramiflorus, and Dicksonia squarrosa. Because grazing inhibits most
   regeneration processes, unfenced remnants of conifer-broadleaved forest
   are unlikely to be maintained in grazed pasture in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing, fire and selective tree cutting are major disturbances that
   shape species diversity in savanna ecosystems, yet their effects are
   highly variable. We carried out a factorial experiment with two levels
   to examine the effects of grazing, fire and selective tree cutting on
   herbaceous species richness, abundance and diversity on two sites in the
   Sudanian savanna-woodlands of Burkina Faso for 10 years (1994-2003). The
   results showed significant inter-annual variation in species richness,
   abundance and diversity at both sites (p<0.001), while main or combined
   effects of fire, grazing and selective cutting were very limited and
   varied between life forms and sites. Grazing tended to favour the
   diversity of perennial grasses; fire tended to influence the richness of
   annual grasses and abundance and diversity of perennial grasses while
   selective tree cutting had no effect on any of the vegetation attributes
   assessed. The combined effect of grazing, fire and selective cutting
   tended to increase the diversity of forbs. In many cases, the responses
   of herbaceous species to treatments were clearer on the site with deeper
   soils than the one with shallow soils. Depending on the site and
   treatments, the inter-annual variation in vegetation attributes was
   partly related to amount and/or frequency of rainfall and partly to
   inter-annual variation in grazing or fire intensity. It can be concluded
   that both disturbances and climatic condition influence the structure
   and diversity of herbaceous flora in the Sudanian savanna-woodland
   ecosystem. The responses were site-specific, which accentuates the
   importance of landscape-scale approaches to understand the impacts of
   disturbances on composition, structure and diversity of savanna
   ecosystems. (C) 2008 Rubel Foundation, ETH Zurich. Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{33-43}},
Abstract = {{The objective of the experiment was to study the effects of different
   frequencies of cutting on long-term changes in the floristic composition
   of grassland, with an emphasis on the effects of very late cutting.
   Cutting at 2, 4, 6, 8 10 and 12-weekly intervals was applied from 1995
   to 2006 in a randomized block experiment on semi-natural grassland
   fertilized with 170 kg N, 40 kg P and 150 kg K ha(-1). The floristic
   composition of treatments was determined in May 1995, 1999, 2002 and
   2006. In the final year (2006) the proportion of grasses in the dry
   matter of harvest was highest (77\%) in the treatment with the least
   frequent cuts, and it was the highest obtained during the whole
   experiment. Under very frequent cuts, the proportion of grasses ranged
   only from 45 to 57\%. Among legumes, only Trifolium repens L. was
   represented in high proportions in the dry matter of the harvest (from
   19 to 25\%) in 2006, but only in the treatments involving high cutting
   frequencies. The proportion of non-legume forbs in treatments involving
   low cutting frequency did not exceed other treatments; moreover, their
   proportion in the dry matter of the harvest in the treatment with the
   lowest cutting frequency decreased significantly to the lowest value
   (19\%). The increased proportion of grasses in treatments with low
   cutting frequency indicates that a very late cut does not necessarily
   mean that forbs increase in the floristic composition, but can help
   grasses to retain their dominant and stable proportion in the
   semi-natural sward. Consequently, when farmers are being provided with
   financial incentives with the aim of protecting diversity and the
   natural environment, it is worth recommending also a very late cutting,
   which includes natural reseeding to a greater extent. This can help to
   find a compromise between farmers' expectations of stable yield and
   quality forage, and the public interest in having grasslands of high
   biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Abundance and diversity of soil microarthropod communities related to
   different land use regime in a traditional farm in Western Norway}},
Journal = {{POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{273-287}},
Abstract = {{Acari and Collembola are the dominant groups within the mycophagous
   arthropods linked to fungal-based food webs in undisturbed soils.
   Studies on soil microarthropod communities in old, traditional,
   multifunctional farmland, and studies on secondary succession following
   marginalization and abandonment of traditional farmland are lacking in
   Europe. Thus, we studied patterns of microarthropod communities related
   to different land use regimes in a traditional farm in Western Norway.
   Soil mesofauna communities were analysed at four sites: site OM - old,
   herb rich, open hay meadow in traditional use; site F1 - abandoned hay
   meadow with pollarded trees (first fallow); site F2 - deciduous woodland
   (abandoned hay meadow with old pollards, heavily overgrown, second
   fallow); and site RM - restored hay meadow with scattered, newly
   pollarded trees. The abundance of the taxa varied considerably between
   habitats (for instance: total microarthropods - from 112.4 +/- 11.4 to
   29.2 +/- 3.4, Acari - from 83.9 +/- 10.2 to 15.6 +/- 1.8 and Oribatida -
   from 68.6 +/- 9.5 to 8.2 +/- 1.3 x 10(3) m(-2), for OM and RM sites
   respectively).
   The abundance of total Acari, total Oribatida, Oribatida adults and
   juveniles differed significantly between OM-F1, OM-RM, OM-F2 and RM-F2
   sites and it was significantly correlated with continuity of land use
   and/or tree cover. Oribatida was the group with the highest densities
   and percentage dominance (except RM site). The percent contribution of
   total Oribatida in Acari abundance was negatively correlated with the
   percentage of Actinedida. Nine Ptyctimina species, six Nothroidea
   species and four Uropodina species were detected, but most of them
   occurred as single individuals. Abundance of three Ptyctimina
   {[}Atropacarus (Atropacarus) striculus (C.L. Koch), Phthiracarus
   ferrugineus (C.L. Koch), P globosus (C.L. Koch)], and two Uropodina
   {[}Trachytes pauperior Berlese and Dinychus perforatus Kramer] species
   differed significantly between some sites. The percentage similarity
   (Renkonen index) has a high indicative value for measuring the distance
   between ecosystems with apparently similar communities of Uropodina.
   The OM and RM sites differed most and site pairs - F1-F2 and F1-RM were
   the most similar. The densities of some taxa were about two-or
   three-fold greater for the F1site than the RM site. Ratios of Acari to
   Collembola, total Oribatida to Collembola and total Oribatida to
   Actinedida were highest on OM site (3.2, 2.6, 11.8 respectively) and
   decreased in the following order: F2>F1>RM (as an example, total
   Oribatida to Actinedida ratios were 9.8 on F2 site, 6.2 on F1 and 3.1.
   on RM). These ratios differed significantly between the OM and RM sites.
   The lowest ratios on RM site are probably an effect of recent
   disturbance (change of land use) of this site. Our results suggest that
   soil in OM site, despite constant disturbance during long time
   (scything, hay raking and sheep grazing), has probably a stable
   mesofauna community with the highest abundance of Oribatida. Our results
   have provided new knowledge about ecosystems in traditional farmland and
   can be used in monitoring programmes of post-arable land.}},

Abstract = {{Rangelands of China have for centuries provided forage for livestock but
   now their role in water, soil, and biodiversity conservation is being
   recognised by Governments and people. However, much of the rangelands
   has recently degraded and desertification is now a widespread problem.
   The cause of the degradation is over-grazing and over-cultivation.
   Climate change is exacerbating the problem. The Chinese Governments have
   begun to address these severe problems through policy adjustments and
   projects. In parallel, some research and development is taking place.
   There are major impediments to addressing the problem; the importance of
   rangelands to China and its people are generally underestimated,
   legislative protection is incomplete and often ineffective, little
   attention is paid to scientific knowledge for development of management
   of natural resources, there is insufficient technological support, and
   Governments are not able to invest sufficiently to effectively restore
   and develop rangeland natural resources. However, with this background
   we propose how the problems might be more effectively addressed in the

Title = {{Pilot study for an assessment of vegetation structure for steppe
   rangelands of Central Anatolia}},
Journal = {{TURKISH JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY}},
Year = {{2008}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{401-414}},
Abstract = {{In the last 50 years, rangelands in the Central Anatolian Region of
   Turkey have been converted to cropping lands, which has negatively
   accelerated vegetation change. resulting in overgrazing and poor
   condition and productivity. In these steppe rangelands, to develop a
   rational basis for making restoration and management decisions. the
   vegetation structure must be well understood. Thus. the objectives of
   this study were to: (1) define vegetation patterns through assessing
   spatial distribution of the plant species and groups, (2) evaluate the
   relationships between vegetation and environmental aspects and range
   condition, and (3) outline possible restoration implementations.
   Therefore, a study was carried out in Pasah village rangelands of
   Nevsehir province in 2004. Thirty-seven sites in 733 ha range area were
   surveyed, and 78 plant species were identified. Most of the identified
   species were forbs (60), followed by grasses (11) and shrubs (7). The
   major range species were Thymus sipyleus (7.2\%). Festuca valesiaca
   (6.9\%). and Bromus tomentellus (6.4\%). Range condition scores fell
   between 1.20 to 3.40, representing very poor to poor condition. The
   positive relation of Bromus tomentellus cover. as an enviable perennial
   grass, with the range condition score (P < 0.001) can pave the way for
   the condition improvement. Our classification result displayed several
   groups of species, although there were not many environmental
   differences, indicating that the groupings are most likely to have
   occurred due to the spatially-varying grazing intensity. In order to
   increase the proportion of desirable species in this over-grazed
   rangeland, the implementation of deferment grazing especially until
   after seed setting should be essential.}},

Abstract = {{Six sheep were trained, over a period of 11 weeks, to work for a reward
   of freshly cut clover by walking along a variable length, U-shaped race.
   Training included habituation to the presence of an observer and to
   isolation from conspecifics. Following training, motivation to eat
   clover was tested by varying the work (distance walked) required to
   access a 5 g (dry matter) clover reward. Each sheep was tested using
   three different race lengths (3, 8 or 20 m) in random order on three
   different days. In each test, the sheep were allowed up to 1 h to access
   the reward 25 times. The sheep could only obtain clover in the reward
   area but could graze grass at all other times. There was a linear
   decline in the number of visits to the reward area within 1 h (P = 0.05)
   as the distance walked increased. Distance walked did not significantly
   affect walking speed in the race (P = 0.10). The latency between visits
   showed a linear decline as number of visits increased (P = 0.01). The
   total amount of clover consumed and the time spent in race transit and
   reward area residency were used to calculate effective clover intake
   rates for each treatment (5.1, 4.4 and 3.7 g DM min(-1)). Theoretical
   calculations indicated that there would be a net energy benefit from
   obtaining the clover reward at the two shorter distance treatments, but
   that using the system at the longest distance would only yield a very
   small energy benefit. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Serengeti-Mara ecosystem holds one of the largest natural grasslands
   of the world, which is well known for its large herds of mammals.
   However, the bird community structure of these grasslands has hardly
   ever been studied. For the first time, a large-scale study on grassland
   bird communities has been conducted in all typical open grasslands of
   the Serengeti National Park. We used ten grassland plots representing a
   gradient of increasing vegetation height and also including shrubs and
   trees to analyse the influence of vegetation structure on the
   composition of grassland bird communities. Three communities of breeding
   birds were identified in relation to (a) short grass, (b) intermediate
   and long grass and (c) wooded grasslands. The bird communities of
   intermediate, long and wooded grassland were very similar, because of
   identical dominant bird species. Our results suggest that breeding birds
   of East African grasslands exhibit two contrasting habitat
   relationships: (1) birds that are restricted to short grass, and (2)
   species that are tolerant to vegetational shifts from intermediate grass
   via long grass to early stages of woody vegetation. Because the
   vegetation is often driven beyond this range in managed tropical
   grasslands through high grazing pressure or through shrub encroachment,
   we expect that the long-grass bird communities will not generally resist
   anthropogenic disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Question: What is the impact of grazing regime on plant species
   abundance, plant growth form, plant productivity and plant nutrient
   concentrations in a forest steppe?
   Location: Hustai National Park in the forest steppe region of Mongolia.
   Methods: On the Stipa steppe we applied three different grazing regimes
   by using; (1) one type of exclosure which excluded grazing by large
   mammalian herbivores, mainly takh (Przewalski horse), (2) another type
   of exclosure that excluded both large and small (Siberian marmots)
   mammalian herbivores, and (3) control plots which were freely grazed. We
   measured species frequencies, tiller densities, plant biomass and
   nitrogen concentrations of the vegetation.
   Results: Exclusion from grazing by takh and marmots significantly
   increased plant standing crop, but marmot grazing and full grazing did
   not show significant differences. Protection from grazing decreased
   forage quality, shown by a lower N-concentration of the standing crop.
   However, this was solely the result of the lower live-dead ratio of the
   vegetation. The frequency of the rhizomatous Leymus chinensis decreased
   under reduced grazing, as did the frequency of the total of rhizomatous
   species. The frequency of Stipa krylovii increased under reduced
   grazing, as did its basal areas, tiller density and tussock height.
   Conclusion: Reduced grazing leads to a lower abundance of rhizomatous
   species and an increase in tussock species.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Has the species-rich vegetation of upland hay meadows been
   maintained under low intensity management imposed by an agri-environment
   scheme? Is the target plant community re-establishing where it has been
   modified previously by intensive agricultural practices? What
   combinations of management practices and soil properties are associated
   with changes towards or away from the target community?
   Location: The Pennines, northern England, UK.
   Methods: A survey of 116 hay meadows in 1987 was repeated in 2002 by
   recording plant species in permanent quadrats. Changes in community
   variables (species richness, Ellenberg values, upland hay meadow
   community coefficients) were analysed in species-rich, modified
   species-rich and degraded grassland types. Redundancy Analysis and
   Generalised Linear Models were used to show the relationship between
   management practices and soil properties and change in species
   composition and community variables.
   Results: Few sites contained the species-rich grassland type, and here
   forb richness declined. In the modified species-rich type, total and
   grass species richness increased but Ellenberg N-values also increased.
   Total and grass species richness increased in the degraded type and the
   community coefficient increased. Management was weakly related to change
   in species composition but showed clear relationships with the community
   variables. Re-establishment of the target species-rich community was
   more likely with late cutting, in the absence of cattle or prolonged
   spring grazing, and at lower soil nutrient status.
   Conclusion: The species-rich community was not maintained but some
   reversion occurred in degraded grassland. Inorganic fertiliser
   application and intensive spring grazing should be avoided and cutting
   delayed until late July.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Is native species occurrence related to soil nutrients in
   highly invaded Californian annual grasslands? What is the best method to
   analyze this relationship, given that native species occur in very low
   numbers and are absent from many locations?
   Location: California, USA.
   Methods: We investigated the effects of soil characteristics and
   livestock grazing on native plant occurrence at 40 plots from six sites
   during the period 2003-2005. Low absolute cover (< 5.8\%) of native
   species resulted in strongly skewed, zero-inflated data sets. To
   overcome problems in the analysis created by non-normality and
   correlations within plots, we used GLMs and GLMMs, either with a Poisson
   or a negative binomial distribution, to analyse native species richness
   and Nassella pulchra cover.
   Results: N. pulchra cover was strongly associated with low phosphorus in
   sandy soils, whereas native species richness was highest in soils with
   low available nitrogen (high C: N).
   Conclusion: Under current conditions, phosphorus seems to be a critical
   factor influencing abundance of N. pulchra. Low fertility soils may
   provide refugia for native species in highly invaded California
   grasslands as they may be below a threshold required for non-native
   annuals to completely dominate. By using non-normal distributions in
   linear models with random components, we report well fitted models with

Abstract = {{Question: How are plant species and functional group composition, and
   potential sward height affected by implementation of different grazing
   regimes on previously abandoned seminatural grassland?
   Location: The Jizerske mountains, northern Czech Republic.
   Methods: We established a randomized block experiment with the following
   treatments: unmanaged control (U), intensive (IG) and extensive (EG)
   continuous grazing, first cut followed by intensive (ICG) and first cut
   followed by extensive (ECG) continuous grazing for the rest of the
   growing season. The percentage cover of all vascular plant species was
   recorded in 40 permanent plots.
   Results: Total plant species richness increased in all managed
   treatments, whereas species number was reduced in U at the end of the
   experiment. Tall forbs (Aegopodium podagraria, Galium album, Anthriscus
   sylvestris, Cirsium arvense) as well as tall grasses (Elytrigia repens
   and Alopecurus pratensis) were more abundant in U. Species associated
   with both grazing treatments (IG, EG) were Dactylis glomerata, Festuca
   rubra agg. and Phleum pratense. Agrostis capillaris, Taraxacum spp.,
   Trifolium repens, Ranunculus repens and Cirsium vulgare were promoted by
   ECG and ICG. Abundance of tall grasses and tall forbs reflected the
   intensity of management in the order U > EG, ECG > IG, ICG. Prostrate
   forbs, on the other hand, increased their cover with increasing
   intensity: ICG > IG > ECG > EG.
   Conclusions: Plant species composition of semi-natural grasslands is
   affected by the defoliation regime. Continuous grazing on abandoned
   grassland alters the sward structure towards a permanent pasture with
   short, light-sensitive grasses and prostrate forbs. To maintain or
   enhance plant species richness in semi-natural grasslands, understanding
   the effects of different grazing regimes on plant species composition is
   necessary.}},

   development was monitored for four years (2002-2005).
   Results: Topsoil removal had a significant effect on the abundance of
   different plant species groups: resident vegetation of agricultural
   grasslands was suppressed, while clonal reed species were facilitated in
   recolonising the area. The establishment of regionally rare and
   endangered species of nutrient-poor fens and wet meadows introduced with
   hay was achieved mainly on plots with topsoil removal, with the
   exception of Rhinanthus angustifolius, which also established on plots
   with intact topsoil. Effects of grazing after four years of experiments
   were of minor influence on species composition.
   Conclusion: The establishment of target plant species of nutrient-poor
   fens is most successful when both an adequate number of viable diaspores
   and suitable sites for germination and establishment are available. In
   our experiment this was achieved by the combination of topsoil removal
   and hay transfer. We recommend this combination, together with
   continuous management (grazing/cutting), for further restoration in fen
   grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the response of a guild of endemic medium and large-bodied
   carabid species to the local (fine-grained) habitat heterogeneity
   induced by man. The study was conducted by means of trapping (without
   killing and preservative agents) and radio-tracking methods (to collect
   data on the spatial ecology of the endangered species Carabus olympiae
   Sella). Habitat differentiation induced by man (a mosaic of beech
   forests, alpen rose shrubberies and pastures) affected species richness
   and abundance of the guild, which were significantly higher in forests
   and/or shrubberies than in pastures. Most species preferred forests and
   shrubberies, with the only exception of Carabus concolor Fabricius,
   which preferred open areas. Species distribution was also affected by
   stone density and cattle grazing intensity. In particular, petrophilous
   species peaked on the roadside because of the high stone density there
   (stones amassed during road construction), while species abundances
   significantly lowered in overgrazed pastures. The compactness of the
   paths made by C. olympiae individuals (evaluated through a tortuosity
   index) was significantly higher in beech forests than in alpen rose
   shrubberies, indicating movements in the latter habitat type were bound
   by the spatial distribution of shrubs, which imposes a limit on path
   tortuosity. Our findings suggest that local ground beetle species
   diversity strongly depends on small-scale anthropogenic variables
   (namely habitat type, stone density and grazing intensity), and that
   habitat modifications (namely from forest to shrubbery) may
   significantly affect species movement patterns. General and local
   conservation management suggestions are given in conformity with these
   results.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the impact of grazing on dung beetle diversity at the
   Barranca de Metztitlan Biosphere Reserve, a xeric ecosystem in central
   Mexico with a long history of use by humans. We compared the community
   structure, as well as the alpha and beta diversity between two cover
   conditions (open and closed vegetation) that represent the impact of
   grazing within a habitat, and between habitat types (submountainous and
   crassicaule scrublands). From 576 samples we collected 75,605 dung
   beetles belonging to 20 taxa. While mean species richness and diversity
   were different between habitat types, cumulative species richness was
   not. The effects of grazing on vegetation structure influenced the
   cumulative species richness and diversity of dung beetles in the
   submountainous scrubland, where grazing has created land mosaics of a
   grassland matrix with scrubland patches. This was not the case in the
   crassicaule scrubland where the impact of grazing is not as evident.
   Beta diversity significantly responds to the effects of grazing on
   habitat conditions. We discuss the ecological factors that may promote
   these responses by landscape diversity components. We also identify the
   species that could act as useful indicators to monitor the effect of
   land management on biodiversity. Our results indicate cattle farming
   maintains a diversified land mosaic, and these areas support more
   diverse dung beetle ensembles than homogeneous areas of closed, shrubby
   vegetation cover. Thus, controlled grazing activity could certainly
   favour the conservation of dung beetle biodiversity and improve
   ecosystem functioning by maintaining dung decomposition rates.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In Europe, many semi-open pasture woodlands with oaks (Quercus robur and
   Q. petraea) have been invaded by other trees. The management
   alternatives for such stands are often debated. Protection (i.e. no
   cutting) versus partial harvest to favour oak regeneration was studied
   in two matched plots in 25 forests in Sweden. A mast year produced on
   average 45,000 oak seedlings/ha in 2001. On average 26\% of the tree
   basal area, but no large oaks, was harvested in experimental plots in
   the winter 2002/03. In 2005, seedling densities were on average 3,900
   per ha in control plots (protected) and 11,600 in experimental plots
   (mainly seedlings from 2002 to 2004). Seedling survival and growth rate
   from 2003 to 2005 were higher in experimental than cutting plots (66\%
   vs 44\%; and +2.8 cm vs -0.8 cm, respectively). Survival and growth were
   positively related to canopy openness; other vegetation, pH, and oak
   basal area had no or little effect. Seedling height before cutting was
   also a positive predictor of survival. The plots contained many more
   intermediate and large oaks than small oak trees. The number of small
   oak trees (1.3 m tall to 5 cm in diameter at 1.3 m) was positively
   related to canopy openness, but unrelated to other measured factors.
   Thus, minor partial cutting increases seedling densities, and adequate
   light favours seedlings/small trees. When oak regeneration is important
   for mixed closed canopy stands with high biodiversity values, such
   partial cutting is useful (e.g. for CO2-neutral biofuel) but needs
   careful evaluation, including effects on biodiversity. (c) 2007 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Controlled forest grazing is expected to yield benefits for biodiversity
   conservation, landscape quality, and in some cases also for land use
   economy. In the Swiss lowlands, first attempts are being made to
   reintroduce forest grazing in productive beech forests, but methodic
   experience is still limited. One main issue concerns the development of
   the vegetation after forest stands have been thinned to improve light
   conditions: Will grassland vegetation establish spontaneously? The
   present study analyses the composition of the soil seed bank of four
   beech forest stands. The seed bank density ranged from 1'244 to 28'651
   seeds m(-2). Seed banks mainly consisted of forest and ruderal species;
   most abundant were Juncus effusus, Carex sylvatica, Rubus spp. and
   Clematis vitalba. Seeds of grassland plants were restricted to a few
   species, and their abundance in the seed bank decreased rapidly with
   increasing distance from the forest edge. These results reveal that
   there is little potential for grasslands to develop spontaneously from
   the seed bank. The introduction of grassland species of local origin
   using the green hay method is therefore recommended to prevent soil
   degradation during the first years of grazing, to fulfil minimal
   biodiversity requirements and to lower the risk of an establishment of
   neophytes and other problematic plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence is accumulating that the continued provision of essential
   ecosystem services is vulnerable to land-use change. Yet, we lack a
   strong scientific basis for this vulnerability as the processes that
   drive ecosystem-service delivery often remain unclear. In this paper, we
   use plant traits to assess ecosystem-service sensitivity to land-use
   change in subalpine grasslands. We use a trait-based plant
   classification (plant functional types, PFTs) in a landscape modeling
   platform to model community dynamics under contrasting but internally
   consistent land-use change scenarios. We then use predictive models of
   relevant ecosystem attributes, based on quantitative plant traits, to
   make projections of ecosystem-service delivery. We show that plant
   traits and PFTs are effective predictors of relevant ecosystem
   attributes for a range of ecosystem services including provisioning
   (fodder), cultural (land stewardship), regulating (landslide and
   avalanche risk), and supporting services (plant diversity). By analyzing
   the relative effects of the physical environment and land use on
   relevant ecosystem attributes, we also show that these ecosystem
   services are most sensitive to changes in grassland management,
   supporting current agri-environmental policies aimed at maintaining
   mowing of subalpine grasslands in Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are one of the world's major ecosystems groups and over the
   last century their use has changed from being volunteer leys, or a
   resource on non-arable land, to a productive resource equal to any crop
   and managed as such. Many grasslands are now being acknowledged as
   having a multifunctional role in producing food and rehabilitating crop
   lands, in environmental management and cultural heritage. However,
   grasslands across the globe are under increasing pressure from
   increasing human populations, reduced areas with increasing livestock
   numbers, and declining terms of trade for livestock production, and they
   are managed to varying degrees of effectiveness. The complexity of
   grassland uses and the many aspects of grassy ecosystems require a
   framework wherein Solutions for better management can be developed. The
   present paper discusses a generic approach to grassland management to
   satisfy these multiple objectives. A focus on ecosystem functionality,
   i.e. on water, nutrient and energy cycling and on the biodiversity
   required to sustain those functions, provides a means of resolving the
   dilemmas faced, through the intermediary, management-related, criteria
   of herbage mass, which also relates directly to animal production.
   Emphasis is placed on the opportunities to satisfy multiple objectives.
   A consideration of the basic relationships between stocking rate and
   animal production shows that the longer-term, economically optimal
   stocking rate is associated with improved environmental outcomes. There
   may be environmental objectives that go beyond economically sustainable
   limits for livestock producers and in those cases direct payments from
   the government or others will be needed. These are likely to be where
   degradation is clearly apparent. The achievement of desirable outcomes
   in grassland management that satisfy multiple objectives will require
   new areas of research that seek viable solutions for farmers and
   society.}},

Abstract = {{Agri-environment schemes (AESs) are designed to create landscape-scale
   improvements in biodiversity. While the specific aims of AESs do not
   always include the enhancement of species of conservation concern,
   associated conservation strategies, such as the UK Biodiversity Action
   Plan, often rest on the assumption that AESs enhance environmental
   conditions and thereby improve the conservation status of target
   species. However, there is little evidence for the general efficacy of
   AESs in this respect.
   To evaluate the effects of the Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA)
   scheme, a widespread AES in Northern Ireland, a spotlight survey of the
   relative abundance of three mammal species, Irish hare Lepus timidus
   hibernicus, European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and red fox Vulpes
   vulpes, was conducted. Of these, the Irish hare is a priority species
   for conservation action and the focus of a species action plan, while
   rabbit and fox are commonly considered agricultural pests. The effects
   of ESA designation and habitat on each species were assessed at 150 ESA
   and 50 non-ESA sites, matched for landscape characteristics.
   The ESA scheme had no demonstrable effect on the abundance of Irish
   hares, and this agri-environment scheme did not target the landscape and
   habitat variables associated with hares.
   In contrast, the abundance of rabbits and foxes was significantly
   greater within ESAs than the wider countryside. Agricultural factors
   such as reduced livestock stocking density, reduced overgrazing and
   field boundary enhancements may create more favourable conditions for
   both species. Aside from the implications for farm economics, the
   proliferation of rabbit populations within conservation areas may raise
   issues concerning the grazing of important plant communities, while
   increases in fox populations may adversely affect ground-nesting birds
   and other animal species of conservation concern.
   Synthesis and applications. The abundance of rabbits and foxes
   corroborates recent work that suggests AESs may benefit common species
   but can not be relied upon to encourage rarer species. The Irish hare
   species action plan relies on agri-environment schemes to enhance the
   species' status and realize the target of increasing the hare population
   by 2010 by promoting suitable habitat. However, the ESA scheme is
   unlikely to help in achieving these objectives. Targeted and
   evidence-based agri-environment prescriptions are clearly required in
   order to ensure the realization of species-specific conservation
   targets.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Is the response of plant traits to environment at the
   community level similar when considering species abundance and when
   considering species presence only?
   Location: Mountain grasslands, central Argentina.
   Methods: We used data from 57 floristic samples, ordinated through DCCA
   along moisture and grazing gradients combined with trait values from 85
   species (plant height, leaf area, leaf thickness leaf toughness and
   SLA). For each sample, we calculated the weighted average (considering
   species abundance) and the simple average (considering only species
   presence). Through multiple regressions we analysed how each average
   (dependent variable) responded to moisture and grazing (DCCA scores
   along Axes 1 and 2, respectively, as independent variables).
   Results: Weighted averages of all traits were significantly associated
   to both gradients, while simple averages did not always respond. In some
   cases the responses followed similar but weaker trends than the
   responses of weighted averages, but in other cases these responses were
   qualitatively different. Traits more associated with size (plant height,
   leaf area, leaf thickness) responded more consistently (similar trends
   for both averages) to grazing than to moisture, while traits more
   associated with plant resource acquisition (SLA, leaf toughness)
   responded more consistently to moisture than to grazing.
   Conclusion: The trait values and combinations which determine the
   probability of species presence are not necessary the same as those
   which determine their probability of becoming abundant. To understand
   community assembly rules, both species presence and species abundance
   should be taken into account as the result of different, although
   closely linked, filtering processes.}},

Abstract = {{Seagrasses, marine flowering plants, are widely distributed along
   temperate and tropical coastlines of the world. Seagrasses have key
   ecological roles in coastal ecosystems and can form extensive meadows
   supporting high biodiversity. The global species diversity of seagrasses
   is low (<60 species), but species can have ranges that extend for
   thousands of kilometers of coastline. Seagrass bioregions are defined
   here, based on species assemblages, species distributional ranges, and
   tropical and temperate influences. Six global bioregions are presented:
   four temperate and two tropical. The temperate bioregions include the
   Temperate North Atlantic, the Temperate North Pacific, the
   Mediterranean, and the Temperate Southern Oceans. The Temperate North
   Atlantic has low seagrass diversity, the major species being Zostera
   marina, typically occurring in estuaries and lagoons. The Temperate
   North Pacific has high seagrass diversity with Zostera spp. in estuaries
   and lagoons as well as Phyllospadix spp. in the surf zone. The
   Mediterranean region has clear water with vast meadows of moderate
   diversity of both temperate and tropical seagrasses, dominated by
   deep-growing Posidonia oceanica. The Temperate Southern Oceans bioregion
   includes the temperate southern coastlines of Australia, Africa and
   South America. Extensive meadows of low-to-high diversity temperate
   seagrasses are found in this bioregion, dominated by various species of
   Posidonia and Zostera. The tropical bioregions are the Tropical Atlantic
   and the Tropical Indo-Pacific, both supporting mega-herbivore grazers,
   including sea turtles and sirenia. The Tropical Atlantic bioregion has
   clear water with a high diversity of seagrasses on reefs and shallow
   banks, dominated by Thalassia testudinum. The vast Tropical Indo-Pacific
   has the highest seagrass diversity in the world, with as many as 14
   species growing together on reef flats although seagrasses also occur in
   very deep waters. The global distribution of seagrass genera is
   remarkably consistent north and south of the equator; the northern and
   southern hemispheres share ten seagrass genera and only have one unique
   genus each. Some genera are much more speciose than others, with the
   genus Halophila having the most seagrass species. There are roughly the
   same number of temperate and tropical seagrass genera as well as
   species. The most widely distributed seagrass is Ruppia maritima, which
   occurs in tropical and temperate zones in a wide variety of habitats.
   Seagrass bioregions at the scale of ocean basins are identified based on
   species distributions which are supported by genetic patterns of
   diversity. Seagrass bioregions provide a useful framework for
   interpreting ecological, physiological and genetic results collected in
   specific locations or from particular species. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V All

   oceanica was investigated by means of a correlational approach over a
   spatial scale of ca. 500 km and at two different depths (5 and 15 m).
   Variability was examined from the double perspective of integrative
   community measures (biomass, species richness and alpha-diversity) and
   species composition. We assessed the influence of biotic and abiotic
   factors on integrative community measures using multiple correlation
   analyses. The influence of these factors in the structure of the whole
   community was investigated using a distance-based RDA for a linear
   model. A total of 129 taxa, mostly epiphytic algae, were recorded across
   all sites and depths. A large part of the variability in species
   composition (51\%) was explained by the variables investigated. In
   particular, variability caused by differences in grazing pressure was
   the most important (25\%), followed by variables related to nutrient
   availability (11\%), meadow structure (6\%), light (5\%) and seagrass
   shoot length (4\%). Among integrative community variables investigated,
   species richness was also best explained by grazing and nutrients. (C)

Abstract = {{The implementation of biodiversity studies to set conservation
   priorities assumes that the different criteria used in prioritisation
   are correlated. Based on butterfly data, we examined whether high total
   diversity (species density and richness), unique species assemblages,
   and high numbers of different categories of Species of European
   Conservation Concern (SPEC) were co-located in the same habitats in the
   Picos de Europa National Park, Spain. Species density (number of species
   per sample) declined with elevation and was significantly higher in
   Genista shrublands on southern slopes (Southern Genista shrubland). We
   found unique species assemblages for Southern Genista shrublands,
   heathlands, mown meadows and subalpine meadows, whereas Genista
   shrubland on northern slopes (Northern Genista shrubland) and pastures
   were occupied by more habitat generalist species. We also found an
   effect of elevation on species composition. Species with global
   distributions concentrated in Europe (SPECs 4b) tended to be associated
   with Southern Genista shrubland, whereas species with global
   distributions restricted to Europe (SPECs 4a) were associated with
   higher elevations. Thus, we suggest a higher conservation value for
   butterfly assemblages located both on Southern Genista shrublands and at
   high elevations as they contain unique assemblages with a higher number
   of SPECs. By comparing our data with a previous study on carabid
   beetles, we found a low coincidence between butterflies and beetles for
   habitats with high species diversity and unique assemblages. Our study
   suggests that preserving areas in the landscape supporting higher
   butterfly diversity only partially preserves those species of greater
   conservation concern, and that butterflies cannot be used as a reliable
   indicator of other priority taxa for conservation, such as carabid
   beetles. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to describe how landscape position,
   grazing management, and scale affected overall plant species richness
   and species richness per functional group in temperate pastures located
   in the central United States. The effects and interactions of summit,
   backslope, and toeslope positions and continuous, rotational, and
   nongrazed stocking systems on species richness were examined at sample
   scales of 0.18 m(2) and 4.5 m(2). Landscape position explained 40-63\%
   of species richness variation at 0.18 m(2) compared to 3-26\% at 4.5
   m(2) for overall, perennial, perennial grass, vegetative-spreading
   grass, perennial herb, and perennial NZ-fixing herb (legume) functional
   groups. Grazing management, in contrast, explained 22-35\% of species
   richness variation for overall, perennial, annual-biennial, perennial
   grass, and perennial bunchgrass functional groups at 0.18 m(2) compared
   to 30-43\% of their variation at 4.5 m(2). Landscape position and
   stocking system mostly did not interact. Overall species richness
   averaged 11.7, 14.3, and 10.3 on summits, backslopes, and toeslopes,
   respectively, and 14.8, 12.9, and 8.7 within the continuous, rotational,
   and nongrazed systems, respectively, at the 4.5 m(2)-scale. Backslope
   positions supported more species than summits and toeslopes regardless
   of scale, with differences that appeared related to total vegetation
   production and aboveground competition. Continuously and rotationally
   stocked pastures also supported more species than nongrazed pastures,
   effects that were consistent across functional types and scales.
   Increased scale enabled detection of a greater number of species per
   unit area but reduced the percentage of species richness variation
   explained by pasture position and management. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The importance of disturbance for regulating the structure and diversity
   of grassy ecosystems is widely recognized, but disturbance-mediated
   interactions between grassland composition and grassland resilience, and
   consequent implications for conservation management, are less well
   documented. We established replicated burning, mowing and
   (non-livestock) grazing regimes in two contrasting grassy woodland
   remnants in south-eastern Australia, and monitored the dynamics and
   resilience of the matrix-forming tussock grasses, Poa sieberiana (Poa)
   and Themeda australis (Themeda), over 12 years. Introduction of frequent
   burning to a Poa-dominated understorey in a rarely burnt woodland
   enhanced dominance by Themeda, and conversely, reduced fire frequency in
   a frequently burnt Themeda grassland substantially increased Poa
   abundance. Burning was potentially detrimental in the Poa-dominated
   woodland, but sward resilience (recovery after the 2002 burn) increased
   as Themeda increased with repeated burning. By contrast, the Themeda
   grassland was resilient to 4- and 8-yearly burning, but biennial burning
   led to poor resilience and high tussock mortality under drought
   conditions. Contrary to other mesic grasslands, cessation of burning had
   not caused sward collapse by 14 years post-fire despite high litter
   accumulation, potentially due to compensatory growth of Poa, lower site
   productivity and drought. Biennial mowing without slash removal was
   similar to 4-yearly burning in effects, while exclusion from kangaroo
   and rabbit grazing significantly increased sward biomass and contributed
   to increased Poa cover and inflorescence production. We conclude that
   functional complementarity associated with mixed dominants enhances
   resilience to variable disturbance regimes, and that below certain
   thresholds of abundance of each dominant, this resilience declines.
   Conservation management of Themeda-Poa ecosystems should thus aim to
   maintain an effective balance of these dominants.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an updated distribution of the Iberian ibex (Capra
   pyrenaica, Schinz 1838) in the central Spanish region of Castile-La
   Mancha is shown. The species is present in 19\% of the study region, and
   in areas not cited so far in the literature. A detailed analysis of
   habitat suitability was also carried out, applying a new methodology,
   Ecological-Niche Factor Analysis, which uses presence data to build a
   habitat suitability map of a given species. As livestock activity is
   quite intense in the region, the presence of a potential competitor, the
   domestic goat (Capra hircus), was included in the analyses. Factors
   affecting ibex relative abundance were determined by means of a nested
   stepwise multiple regression, where livestock presence/absence was the
   nested factor. The presence of livestock has a negative effect on ibex
   relative abundance, causing the ibex to select areas of poor, sparse
   vegetation, cultivated lands and forests, whereas in the absence of
   livestock, the ibex is mainly present in pasture-scrub lands and
   non-cultivated lands. Conservation implications of these results are
   discussed in the context of a Mediterranean region where extensive
   livestock grazing systems abound.}},

Abstract = {{During the past few decades, many heathland species in Western Europe
   have declined significantly, mainly because of habitat loss. In
   particular, species that need active management for their survival may
   be more prone to extinction than later successional species. In this
   paper, we tested if six local factors (type of last management, canopy
   height, \% cover of bare soil, pH and mean Ellenberg N (productivity)
   and F (soil moisture)) and/or three regional variables (patch size,
   patch age, i.e. interval since last practice, and isolation) have impact
   on the distribution and abundance of the endangered holoparasite Cuscuta
   epithymum. The presence of this species, its population size and host
   range were studied in more than 160 heathland patches within four nature
   reserves in Flanders (Belgium). The structure of the canopy, determined
   by management, was the key factor controlling the abundance of this
   species. The parasite performed best (in terms of population size) in
   patches which has been managed (mowing, burning or turf-cutting) in the
   previous seven years, mainly composed of young Calluna vulgaris
   individuals and had a canopy height between 10 and 30 cm. However,
   contrary to expectations, distribution patterns were not related to any
   other local or regional variable, except for site location. We,
   therefore, suggest that the current distribution of C. epithymum in this
   dynamic heath landscape may be driven by the presence of a persistent
   seed bank. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We conducted a long-term experiment in grassland with the aim of
   elucidating grassland dynamics in relation to variations in rainfall
   amount and spatial and temporal variation in disturbance. In particular
   we aimed to increase our understanding of ecosystem dynamics and
   function, species redundancy, invasion biology, and other related
   topics. We studied the dynamics of serpentine annual grassland in
   northern California over the period 1983-2002 in a replicated series of
   experimental plots comprising controls, gopher exclosures, and
   aboveground herbivore exclosures. Annual rainfall amount varied greatly
   during the study period, which included two major El Nino events and a
   period of prolonged below-average rainfall. Gopher disturbance was
   highly variable both spatially and temporally but was positively
   correlated with soil depth. Disturbance was reduced but not eliminated
   from the gopher exclosures and was significantly increased in the
   aboveground herbivore exclosures. Grassland dynamics were driven by
   rainfall amounts and distributions that had the most pronounced effects
   on the dominant plant species, while gopher disturbance had additional
   effects on the rarer species. Effects of excluding aboveground
   herbivores were swamped by a large increase in gopher disturbance within
   aboveground exclosures. Overall species numbers were reduced during a
   period of below-average rainfall but recovered in subsequent years.
   There was a large array of different responses of individual plant
   species to both rainfall and disturbance. Our results provide support
   for the ``insurance'' hypothesis, which suggests that biodiversity
   buffers ecosystem processes against environmental changes because
   different species (or phenotypes) respond differently to these changes,
   leading to functional compensations among species. Here, a species that
   was at very low abundance levels at the start of the study (Microseris
   douglasii) temporarily increased in abundance to become one of the
   dominant species in the grassland following a period of prolonged
   below-average rainfall. We also observed the repeated invasion of the
   serpentine grassland by the nonnative grass Bromus hordeaceus, which
   increased greatly in abundance following both of the major El Nino
   events. The results emphasize the importance of long-term observations
   in providing a context for shorter-term studies and allowing analysis of
   plant community responses to climate variation and disturbance,
   particularly in the face of ongoing global change.}},

Abstract = {{The research was initiated to determine the impact of long-term (16
   years) differentiated N, P, K supply on the floristic diversity of
   conventionally used pastures classified as Lolio-Cynosuretum. At four
   different sites the factors N supply (0, 160 and 320 kg N ha(-1) a(-1)),
   P supply (0.26 and 52 kg P ha(-1) a(-1)) and K supply (0.66 and 133 kg K
   ha(-1) a(-1)) were tested in 27 different supply combinations in a
   factorial design with three replicates. Dry matter (DM) yields of the
   1(st) cut, soil chemical values (pH, P and K concentrations) and the
   number of species were determined.
   Site-independent N fertilisation had the largest influence on the
   diversity, reducing the number of species as a consequence of light
   competition due to an increase in biomass productivity as well as a
   decrease in soil pH-levels. Mostly, also the factor K had a significant
   effect. Recorded species numbers ranged from 7 up to 35 species 25
   m(-2). On most sites a `humpback relationship' (unimodal relationship)
   could be observed between productivity and the species number, with
   maximum species numbers reached with first cut yield levels between 2.5
   and 3.5 t DM ha(-1). The humpback relationship between productivity and
   species richness however was not a curve, but an envelope filled with
   points, indicating that besides productivity also other factorS
   influence the attained species number. In this view the highest number
   of species were recorded in case of a co-limitation of N and K,
   indicated by a N:K ratio in the above ground biomass between l and 1.5,
   as well as soil pH-levels between 4.5 and 5.5.}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity was investigated in
   non-grazed, restored and over-grazed (fenced) plots of a grassland in
   the Inner Mongolia steppe. Plant cover and variety differ between the
   plots, being highest in the non-grazed to lowest in the over-grazed
   plots. A total of 19 AM fungal taxa belonging to six genera were found
   based on spores isolated from field samples and trap cultures. One
   belonged to Acaulospora, one to Archaeospora, one to Entrophospora, one
   to Gigaspora, 12 to Glomus and three to Scutellospora. Glomus was the
   dominant genus in all plots, and Glomus geosporum was the dominant
   species, whilst G. albidum and G. etunicatum were dominant in the
   restored plot. Scutellospora was the second dominant genus in the
   non-grazed plot with Scutellospora calospora being the dominant species.
   The mean spore density and mean species richness of AM fungi were
   significantly decreased by long-term over-grazing. The Sorenson's
   similarity coefficients of AM fungal community composition ranged from
   0.5 to 0.64 among the three types of plot management. The results
   suggest that the AM fungal diversity is greatly affected by long-term

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{154}},

Abstract = {{In grassland systems across the globe, ecologists have been attempting
   to understand the complex role of fire, grazing and rainfall in creating
   habitat heterogeneity and the consequences of anthropogenic control of
   these factors on ecosystem integrity and functioning. Using a South
   African grassland ecosystem as a model, we investigated the impact of
   fire and grazing pressure on small mammal communities during three
   differing periods of a rainfall cycle. Over 2 years, 15,203 trap nights
   revealed 1598 captures of 11 species (nine rodents, one macroscelid and
   one insectivore). Results highlighted the importance of the interplay
   between factors and showed that the role of fire, grazing and rainfall
   in determining small mammal abundance was species-dependant. While no
   two species were affected by the same environmental variables, grass
   cover or height was important to 56\% of species. Considered
   independently, high rainfall had a positive influence on small mammal
   abundance and diversity, although the lag period in population response
   was species-specific. High grazing negatively affected overall
   abundance, but specifically in Mastomys coucha; fire alone had little
   immediate impact on small mammal diversity. Six months after the fire,
   vegetation cover had recovered to similar levels as unburned areas,
   although small mammal diversity and richness were higher in burned areas
   than unburned areas. Grazing levels influenced the rate of vegetation
   recovery. In conclusion, low-level grazing and burning can help to
   maintain small mammal biodiversity, if conducted under appropriate
   rainfall levels. A too high grazing pressure, combined with fire, and/or
   fire conducted under drought conditions can have a negative impact on
   small mammal biodiversity. To maintain small mammal diversity in
   grassland ecosystems, the combined effects of the previous year's
   rainfall and existing population level as well as the inhibition of
   vegetation recovery via grazing pressure need to be taken into
   consideration before fire management is applied.}},

Volume = {{193}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances have played a significant role in shaping vegetation
   patterns following European settlement and agricultural development in
   Australia, particularly over the last 100 years. However, little is
   known about the temporal dynamics of plant communities in relation to
   disturbances and their interactions. In this study we examined the
   response and recovery of temperate grassland communities to disturbance,
   using a multi-factorial experiment involving grazing exclusion (absent
   and present), fire (absent and present), soil cultivation (none, 5 and
   20 cm) and soil amendment (none, fertiliser and fertiliser plus clover
   seeds) on the New England Tablelands in NSW, Australia. Temporal
   patterns of plant communities were analysed using detrended
   correspondence analysis for eight surveys over 24 months. Vegetation
   patterns at each survey were analysed using principal components
   analysis. The effects of treatments on malleability (Bray-Curtis
   dissimilarity) of plant communities were analysed using a linear mixed
   model, and the relationships between malleability and plant species
   groups were depicted using a generalised additive model and further
   analysed using a linear model. Perennial native grasses and a non-native
   forb (Hypochaeris radicata) initially dominated the vegetation, but
   after the disturbances H. radicata and other non-native species
   dominated. Compositional changes from the initial states were greatest
   in the first spring (7 months after treatment application), and then the
   vegetation tended to recover towards its original state. Soil
   cultivation resulted in the greatest deviation in community composition,
   followed by soil amendment, fire, with grazing exclusion the least. The
   recovery process and rate of recovery varied with treatment reflecting
   the dominance of soil cultivation and its interactions with other forms
   of disturbances. Soil amendment and grazing exclusion tended to reduce
   the effects of soil cultivation. Malleability was negatively related to
   perennial native grasses; positively to other non-native species, annual
   native grasses and perennial native sedges/rushes; and negatively to H.
   radicata when its cover was below 18\%, but positively when above 18\%.
   The degree of malleability reflected the high resilience of the
   vegetation to disturbance, and was mainly due to the recovery of
   perennial native grasses and H. radicata. This resilience demonstrated
   that the small-scale disturbances did not cause vegetation to cross an
   ecological threshold and that the present vegetation is resilient to
   common disturbances occurring at small scales. The results also suggest
   (1) that the present vegetation has developed mechanisms to adapt to
   these disturbances, (2) the importance of disturbance scale or (3) that
   the ecological threshold had already been crossed and the present
   vegetation is in a degraded state compared with its original state
   before the end of the 19th century.}},

Abstract = {{Wildlife managers are often required to make important conservation and
   recovery decisions despite incomplete and uncertain knowledge of the
   species and ecosystems they manage. Conducting further research to
   collect more empirical data may reduce that uncertainty. However, a
   sense of urgency often surrounds threatened or endangered species'
   management and decisions cannot wait until a definitive understanding of
   a species' ecology and distribution is obtained. Bayesian belief
   networks (BBNs) are proving to be valuable and flexible tools for
   integrating available expert knowledge and empirical data, thus
   strengthening conservation decisions when empirical data is lacking. We
   developed a BBN model and linked it to a geographical information system
   (GIS) to map habitat suitability for the Julia Creek dunnart
   (Sminthopsis douglasi), an endangered ground-dwelling mammal of the
   Mitchell grasslands of north-west Queensland, Australia. Expert
   knowledge, supported by field data, was used to determine the
   probabilistic influence of grazing pressure, density of the invasive
   shrub prickly acacia (Acacia nilotica), land tenure, soil variability
   and seasonal variability on dunnart habitat suitability. The model was
   then applied in a GIS to map the likelihood of suitable dunnart habitat.
   Sensitivity analysis was performed to identify the influence of
   environmental conditions and management options on habitat suitability.
   The study provides an example of how expert knowledge and limited
   empirical data can be combined within a BBN model, and linked to GIS
   data, to assist in recovery planning of endangered fauna populations.

Abstract = {{In temperate Australia, sustainability of biodiversity in
   poorly-reserved woodland remnants within agricultural landscapes is a
   priority. Cornerstone species, such as those comprising the tree
   overstorey, are essential as a seed source for regeneration and for
   microclimate amelioration, soil erosion prevention and habitat provision
   in woodland ecosystems. However, trees within many woodland remnants are
   rapidly deteriorating in health. This has been attributed to several
   causes, including three decades of below average rainfall in temperate
   Australia. However, instances where trees are healthy and declining on
   either side of a management boundary indicate a key role of management
   in the condition of woodland remnants. We investigated the effects of
   past management on soil properties and vegetation understorey, and
   linked these with overstorey tree health across 49 sites within the
   agricultural Midlands of Tasmania, Australia. Sixty percent of the
   variation in overstorey tree health was associated with the cover of
   native shrubs, litter, moss and lichen in healthy sites and with cover
   of exotic pasture species in declining sites. Soil attributes explained
   72\% of the variation in tree health, with healthy sites having lower
   soil total nitrogen and pH, and higher soil organic carbon. A
   combination of soil and understorey vegetation attributes entirely
   separated healthy, declining and poor sites in a canonical analysis.
   Regression tree analysis indicated that grazing history (fencing,
   grazing frequency and intensity) was the primary management history
   factor in separating healthy and poor sites, whilst patch size, fire
   frequency and wood gathering were secondary, but significant, factors.
   Sites that were only lightly, if at all, grazed, had a fire frequency
   >10 years, and did not have coarse woody debris removed were healthy,
   indicating that the drying and warming climate of the past three decades
   is within the bioclimatic envelope of the species examined.(C) 2007

Abstract = {{1. Understanding the productivity-diversity relationship (PDR) is a key
   issue in biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research, and has important
   implications for ecosystem management. Most studies have supported the
   predominance of a hump-shaped form of PDR in which species richness
   peaks at an intermediate level of productivity. However, this view has
   been challenged recently on several grounds.
   2. Based on data from 854 field sites across the Inner Mongolia region
   of the Eurasian Steppe, we tested the form of PDR at different
   organizational levels (association type, vegetation type and biome) and
   multiple spatial scales (local, landscape and regional).
   3. Our results showed that a positive linear, rather than hump-shaped,
   form was ubiquitous across all organizational levels and spatial scales
   examined. On the regional scale, this monotonic PDR pattern corresponded
   closely with the gradient in mean annual precipitation (MAP) and soil
   nitrogen. Increasing species dissimilarity with productivity could also
   contribute to the positive linear form of PDR.
   4. Our results also indicated that grazing decreased both primary
   productivity and species richness but, intriguingly, not the form of
   PDR.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides the first direct test
   of the productivity-diversity relationship for the world's largest
   contiguous terrestrial biome - the Eurasian Steppe. The predominance of
   a positive linear relationship in this region defies the commonly held
   view that a unimodal form of PDR dominates terrestrial ecosystems,
   supported mainly by studies in Africa, Europe and North America. It
   suggests that precipitation has a greater control on the
   productivity-diversity relationship in the Eurasian Steppe than
   grasslands elsewhere. Also, the positive linear relationship is
   surprisingly robust to grazing. Our results provide new insight into the
   productivity-diversity relationship and have several implications for
   restoring degraded lands and understanding ecological consequences of
   climate change in the Eurasian Steppe.}},

Title = {{Use of vegetation classification and plant indicators to assess grazing

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Question: What are the effects of grazing abandonment on the vegetation
   composition of Estonian coastal wetlands? Location: Vormsi Island and
   Silma Nature Reserve in western Estonia, Europe.
   Methods: Local knowledge and field reconnaissance were used to identify
   current and historical management levels of wetland sites within the
   west Estonian study area. Nine study sites, with varying management
   histories, were selected comprising an area of 287 ha. A total of 198
   quadrats were taken from 43 distinct vegetation patches in. ve of the
   sites. TWINSPAN analysis was used to identify community type, and a
   phytosociological key was constructed for character taxa. This
   vegetation classification was then applied within a GIS-based context to
   classify all the study sites, using a ground survey technique and 1:2000
   scale air photos.
   Results: We identified 11 different brackish coastal wetland community
   types. Indicator species were defined with community characteristics for
   the seven main vegetation types readily recognisable in the field.
   Coastal wet grasslands were most extensive in grazed sites, or sites
   that had been more intensively grazed, while abandoned sites were
   largely composed of Phragmites australis stands, tall grassland, and
   scrub. Site variations based on vegetation composition were
   significantly correlated with past grazing intensity. Plant community
   types showed significant edaphic differences, with particularly low soil
   moisture and high conductivity and pH for open pioneer patches compared
   to other vegetation types.
   Conclusion: Abandonment of traditionally grazed coastal grasslands
   threatens their characteristic biodiversity. This study found that
   grazing abandonment reduced the extent of coastal wetland grasslands of
   particular conservation value. Nevertheless, plant species of
   conservation interest were found across the sequence of community types
   described. The study shows that grazing is an important factor
   influencing coastal wetland plant communities but suggests that
   vegetation distribution is affected by environmental variables, such as
   topography.}},

Abstract = {{The perennial grass Phalaris arundinacea (reed canarygrass) is a
   widespread invader of North American wetlands. We asked if the use of
   herbicide with burning, clipping, or seeding could reduce the cover of
   P. arundinacea and increase cover of native species in a wet prairie
   that receives stormwater runoff. Two glyphosate treatments decreased P
   arundinacea cover, and spring seeding of 33 native species doubled
   species richness and floristic quality compared to no seeding. Despite
   an initial decrease in abundance, P. arundinacea cover was no different
   than control plots two years after seeding and overall native species
   richness and cover decreased from the previous year. Application of the
   grass-specific herbicide sethoxydim in the third year of the study
   reduced P. arundinacea cover and height while allowing native forbs and
   graminoids to persist. Most of the 75 species identified during the
   study were perennial, native forbs, and most of the sown species that

Abstract = {{Considering the frequent nature of fires and resultant drastic change in
   habitat following fire, research on the effects of fire on birds in the
   grasslands of South Africa is surprisingly scarce. For at least five
   months after burns we followed the changes in bird species composition,
   species richness and densities of two controlled burns and one
   accidental fire at the Barberspan Nature Reserve in grasslands that had
   not been burned or grazed in 10 years, Compared with the control areas,
   species richness and densities increased in the burned areas immediately
   following the burns, with more species and birds recruited to the burned
   areas than were lost. Immediate post-burn opportunists tended to be
   larger species, and the biomass increase mirrored the increases in
   species richness and densities in burned areas. Avian species richness,
   densities and biomass tended to return to the initial conditions after a
   number of months. Although the bird communities from two
   controlled-burns differed before the burns, they converged to a
   characteristic immediate post-burn composition. Five months after the
   burns however, the bird communities reflected a pre-burn composition.
   Indications were that birds in an area larger than that burned were
   affected. Mosaic burning, with shifting large and small patches, should
   be considered on a landscape scale.}},

Abstract = {{While recent theoretical work has demonstrated several mechanisms
   whereby more diverse communities can exhibit greater resistance against
   herbivore pressure, empirical examinations have been few and the subject
   of much debate. The aim of this microcosm experiment was to determine
   how selectivity of grazing by herbivores affected relationships between
   plant species number and productivity within artificially created
   grassland communities. The influence of the slug, Arion lusitanicus, was
   assessed at four levels of plant species diversity (one, two, four and
   six species per aquarium). The proportion of biomass of particular
   species eaten by a slug was estimated on the basis of comparison of
   paired plots. The biomass in control (ungrazed) plots was compared with
   the biomass in grazed plots. A significant interaction between the
   number of plant species and slug grazing for aboveground biomass was
   found, indicating a gradual decrease in the effect of grazing pressure
   with increased species richness. Positive average values of the
   complementarity effect and overyielding index, and negative values of
   the selection effect, indicated niche resource partitioning between
   species in grazed plots. The electivity index of food selectivity
   suggested that food selectivity was more pronounced under higher plant
   species diversity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Introduced molluscs have invaded endangered, remnant native grasslands
   of south-eastern Australia, but few studies have investigated their
   distribution, abundance or potential impact. Molluscs were surveyed in
   grassland sites across an urban to rural transect west of Melbourne,
   Australia. It was confirmed that several introduced mollusc species have
   invaded these areas. Three snail and five slug species were identified,
   none of which was native to Australia. The most common species was the
   brown field slug (Deroceras panormitanum). Mollusc capture and species
   richness were positively related to the degree of urbanization in the
   surrounding landscape. There was also a negative relationship with fire
   frequency. Feeding trials revealed selective herbivory by the
   black-keeled slug (Milax gagates) among native plants. Anecdotal
   evidence that variable glycine (Glycine tabacina) and button wrinklewort
   (Rutidosis leptorrhynchoides) are palatable to molluscs was supported.
   Mollusc herbivory may potentially lead to reduced fitness of palatable
   species, and changes in community composition and structure.}},

Abstract = {{The little bustard Tetrax tetrax is a threatened grassland bird highly
   reliant on agro-ecosystems for survival. Understanding its habitat
   requirements throughout its yearly cycle is essential to promoting
   adequate management practices. A late summer, post-breeding habitat
   selection study was conducted at three sites located in Alentejo, in the
   south of Portugal. Overall, 48 flocks were counted. A highly-significant
   explanatory logistic model demonstrated that little bustard
   post-breeding sightings primarily occur in locations with greater food
   availability, adequate vegetation height, and more productive soils.
   Fallow land and areas grazed by sheep tend to be avoided. Additionally,
   the species abundance was estimated at 18 sites distributed among the
   specie's main range in Portugal, covering 67,000 ha and 971 km of car
   transects. Another 119 flocks were registered. Surprisingly, hardly any
   birds were found at priority breeding sites. overall, the data suggest
   that important breeding populations of the little bustard dependent upon
   extensive agriculture within Iberia (generally where soils are less
   productive), are likely to depend on other areas with greater food
   availability during the dry summer season. Maintaining suitability of
   the habitat near important breeding areas with more productive soils
   could prevent further species movement in search of foraging areas and
   diminish mortality risk. At these sites, conservation efforts should
   focus on maintaining the landscape open and ensure the dominance of low
   intensity land uses with short vegetation, such as cereal stubbles or
   certain legume crops. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   higher in the propagule addition plots than in the plots to which
   propagules were not added. Surprisingly, this interaction was
   significant only when the abundance of herbivores was experimentally
   reduced. This experiment provides evidence that native insect herbivores

Abstract = {{This study explored the impacts of sustained heavy grazing in six
   vegetation types across an altitudinal and rainfall gradient in the
   Kamiesberg mountain range in Namaqualand. The study was carried out
   across the fence separating the Leliefontein communal area and
   surrounding privately owned farms. The communal area has been stocked
   over decades at approximately twice the government recommended stocking
   rate, while adjacent privately owned farms have generally adhered to
   recommended rates. Plant community data were collected from 66, 0.1 ha
   modified Whittaker plots and analysed for diversity and compositional
   changes. Consideration of community-wide responses through NMDS
   ordination showed that heavy grazing did not result in the dominance of
   a few wide-spread, weedy species in communal areas. Species richness at
   the 0.1 ha scale was also not affected by different land use practices.
   However, there was a significant compositional shift away from large
   woody and succulent shrubs, and an associated increase in dwarf shrubs
   and herbaceous perennial plants on the communal areas. This shift was
   only evident on the sandy lowland habitats, while a reduction in
   perennial grass was recorded in the rocky upland habitats on the
   communal areas. Compositional shifts towards smaller and more ephemeral
   species in the communal area are indicative of a system more closely
   dependent on rainfall. This has implications for people's livelihoods in
   the region, particularly in light of predicted climate change. (c) 2006

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Nutrient availability, defoliation and soil disturbance are important
   factors that influence the richness of plant communities. However, few
   studies have examined the interactions between these factors, especially
   in harsh environments. We therefore examined the effects of
   fertilization, defoliation and soil disturbance on plant species
   richness in an alpine meadow in northern Sweden.
   2. From 2002 to 2005, plots were fertilized, mowed and disturbed
   annually in a factorially designed experiment. Plant species richness,
   colonization and extinction were recorded in permanent subplots.
   Seedling densities and recruitment from seed of Potentilla crantzii were
   also estimated in order to examine the mechanisms whereby these
   treatments influence colonization by new species.
   3. Species richness peaked in the absence of disturbance in unfertilized
   plots and with light disturbance in fertilized plots. Colonization by
   new vascular plant species, seed recruitment and seedling density were
   all increased by soil disturbance, suggesting that colonization was
   increased because conditions were more favourable for seed recruitment
   following the disturbance treatment. Extinction of species was highest
   in the mowed, intensively disturbed and unfertilized plots and lowest in
   the fertilized, lightly disturbed and unmowed plots.
   4. Local extinction was negatively correlated with both moss and
   vascular plant biomass. Local colonization, seedling density and
   recruitment of P. crantzii were all strongly negatively correlated with
   the biomass of mosses. In contrast, the biomass of vascular plants was
   only weakly correlated with local colonization, seedling density and
   recruitment of P. crantzii.
   5. This study suggest that the level of disturbance at which species
   richness peaks should move towards higher disturbance levels when
   productivity increases. However, lower extinction rates rather then
   higher colonization rates seem to be causing the increase in species
   richness following disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this research was to test the hypothesis that effects
   of different clipping regimes on diversity on an alpine meadow are due
   to soil fertility. Species richness should be greatest at an
   intermediate level of disturbance, e.g., clipping, since dominance is
   prevented and the pool of potential colonists is relatively large. We
   predict the effects of clipping on species richness, diversity and
   above-ground biomass based on the disturbance hypothesis. A natural
   pasture was used for the experiment that was a randomised complete block
   design with four levels of nutrient input annually from the 2001 growing
   season. During 2004, subplots were clipped to stubble heights of 2, 4
   and 10 cm above the soil surface, with a control. Species richness
   declined to an average of 6 and 19 species per quadrat for the
   treatments that were heavily clipped twice, compared to an average of I
   I and 31 species per quadrat in the unclipped treatment receiving
   nutrient input of 120 g of fertiliser/m(2) and control plots,
   respectively. Species richness was not altered by the other clipping
   treatments at any nutrient level. Species richness declined in plots
   with the highest nutrient input and in control plots with heavy clipping
   twice, but species richness had no obvious changes in those plots
   receiving the intermediate level clipping at all nutrient levels.
   Available phosphorus increased significantly with increased nutrient
   addition, however soil pH decreased. Available nitrogen and organic
   matter did not change significantly with nutrient addition. The clipping
   regime contributed to the dominance of graminoids with increased
   nutrient input, and the dominant graminoids assimilated large amounts of
   available nitrogen and organic matter, which resulted in the minor
   changes in available nitrogen in soil.}},

Abstract = {{The proliferation of disease-vector mosquitoes has been attributed to
   the effects of land-use change. We investigated the relationship between
   land use, macroinvertebrate communities, and water chemistry in
   water-filled containers in native forest, pasture land, and urban land
   at two locations (Waikanae and Paraparaumu) in the Kapiti region, New
   Zealand. Larvae of the endemic Culex pervigilans and exotic Aedes
   notoscriptus constituted 45.0\% and 55.0\% of all late-instar mosquito
   species collected. At Waikanae, fourth instar A. notoscriptus, pupal,
   and total mosquito densities were higher in native forest than in urban
   land and pasture land, and pupal density was higher in native forest
   than in pasture land. At Paraparaumu, fourth instar A. notoscriptus and
   pupal densities were higher in native forest and urban land than in
   pasture land. Macro invertebrate communities in human-modified land uses
   were dominated by two herbivorous chironomid species, consisted of fewer
   species, higher densities, and different composition than in native
   forest. Water chemistry was also associated with land use, with nitrate,
   nitrite, and acidity higher in native forest at both locations. Fourth
   instar A. notoscriptus, pupal, and total mosquito densities were
   negatively associated with non-culicid invertebrate density. Fourth
   instar A. notoscriptus density was also negatively associated with pH.
   Fourth instar C. pervigilans density was not significantly related to
   any water chemistry variables. These results indicate that land-use
   change may not necessarily lead to higher densities of mosquitoes in
   larval habitats by altering the associated macroinvertebrate community.}},

Abstract = {{In 1966, the Cernikovice experiment, Czech Republic, was started when an
   alluvial meadow dominated by Alopecurus pratensis was subjected to the
   following fertilizer treatments: non-fertilized control, PK, N50PK,
   N100PK, N150PK, and N200PK. The experimental plots were cut three times
   per year in the initial phase of the experiment and twice per year since
   the late 1980s. In mid May 2005, plant cover was visually estimated,
   biomass yield and sward height measured in order to detect changes in
   the grassland ecosystem caused by this long-term fertilizer treatment.
   After 40 years treatment was a significant predictor of sward structure,
   explaining 32\% of the variability in plant cover data in RDA. Legumes
   were not detected in the N200PK treatment and achieved the highest cover
   in the control and PK treatment. Grasses had the lowest cover in the PK
   treatment and control, which significantly differed from all treatments
   with N. Alopecurus pratensis prevailed in all NxPK treatments. Herbs had
   the highest cover in the control followed by the PK treatment and both
   treatments significantly differed from the N,PK treatments. Achillea
   millefolium was recorded in all treatments, but the highest cover was
   recorded in the control treatment. Species richness of vascular plants
   ranged from 8 per in 2 in the N200PK treatment to 24 in the control. A
   significant decrease in species richness with increase in sward height
   was detected. The cover of mosses ranged from 1 to 6\% like sward height
   gradually increased with fertilizer application. Aboveground biomass
   yield was significantly lower in the control than all other treatments.
   Based on the results of the Cernikovice experiment and a comparison with
   other long-term fertilizer experiments it is concluded that naturally
   highly productive grasslands are much less threatened by the
   inappropriate application of fertilizers than low productive grasslands
   with a specific plant species composition.}},

Abstract = {{Forest ground vegetation constitutes the largest number of plant species
   that participate in forest dynamics. Single species or species groups of
   forest ground vegetation can be used as indicators for site conditions.
   Ground vegetation has to be accounted in forest simulation modeling if
   biodiversity dynamics are evaluated to serve the purpose of sustainable
   forest management. The usual approach is to segregate ground vegetation
   into plant functional types. However, there are other methods that could
   be used. In our contribution we propose to split ground vegetation into
   ecological-coenotic species groups. An application of the
   ecological-coenotic approach allowed for a forecasting of the dynamics
   of forest ground vegetation diversity on the basis of forest ecosystem
   modeling outputs, standard forest inventory data, and regional
   phytosociological data sets. A new software BioCalc designed for the
   forecasting of dynamics of forest ground vegetation diversity, and the
   EFIMOD model of the forest growth and element cycling in the forest-soil
   system is used for simulating the forest ecosystem parameters under
   different forest management regimes.
   An application of the proposed method for a study area situated in the
   Central European Russia is discussed. Two hundred-year dynamics of
   ground vegetation composition, forest types and species diversity is
   analysed under four forest management scenarios: NAT, natural
   development; SCU, selective cuttings; LRU, authorized by Russian
   legislation clear cuttings; ILL, non-authorized by the legislation but
   widespread clear cuttings. The simulation results showed that the total
   number of forest types is higher in all scenarios with cuttings relative
   to the NAT scenario. However, the NAT strategy leads to the growth of
   coniferous-broad-leaved forests close to the climax forest type of the
   study area. Cuttings hinder the development of climax forest structure
   due to the low level of deadwood in harvested forests and the absence of
   species-rich forest units dominated by nitrophilous tall herbs in the
   understorey. The NAT strategy leads to the highest species diversity in
   ground vegetation if a free forest development has taken place for
   rather long time, i.e. more than 100 years in the study area. The sum of
   species diversity is rather low for SCU, LRU, and ILL scenarios. It is
   0.8, 0.7, and 0.6, respectively, in comparison with the NAT scenario.
   The SCU scenario lead to a simplification of ground vegetation together
   with a conservation of nemoral and boreal species. Scenarios with clear
   cuttings (LRU and ILL) maintain piny and meadow groups in ground
   vegetation.
   None of the forest management scenario leads to the maintenance of the
   whole set of ecological-coenotic groups in ground vegetation. Only a
   spatial combination of different management regimes in the forest area
   is necessary for the biodiversity restoration and maintenance. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{In European grasslands, livestock grazing is a key driver of habitat
   quality. However, the specific grazing regimes that favour habitat
   quality and ensure biodiversity conservation remain largely unknown.
   This paper develops a dynamic model to predict how livestock grazing may
   be used to sustain a bird community without penalizing cattle feeding.
   The model focuses on a grassland grazed by cattle which is also the
   breeding habitat of three wader species. it integrates the dynamics of a
   sward, controlled through grazing, and that of three bird populations.
   Viability theory and dynamic programming are used to reveal Viable
   grazing strategies that ensure the creation of two levels of habitat
   quality (homogeneous and heterogeneous) whilst ensuring cattle feeding.
   Viable grazing strategies are ranked through an economic criterion and
   referred as ecologic or economic grazing. Then using viability
   population analysis, we assess the extinction risk of the wader
   community in both levels of habitat quality. Globally, grazing had a
   more positive effect on the wader community than did the no-grazing
   scenario. Both levels of habitat quality could be generated through both
   grazing strategies corresponding to contrasting temporal distributions
   of livestock densities. Grazing strategies resulted in differential
   community viability. Ecologic grazing always ensured wader community
   maintenance, whatever the level of habitat quality targeted. This was
   not the case for economic grazing which reduced the wader community to
   two species. Species response showed two contrasting patterns, with a
   more dramatic decline for lapwings than redshanks in both the no-grazing
   and heterogeneous habitat quality scenarios. This may lead to
   conservation problems because of the relationship between population
   size and probability of extinction observed for lapwings. (c) 2007

Abstract = {{The effects of natural succession and invasions of indigenous reed

   The total number of species and individuals, mean number of species per

   fallow lands, old fallow lands and young forests, and the lowest in
   fallow lands invaded by reed and goldenrod and in mature forests. These
   results (1) reveal the importance of extensively mown meadows and fallow
   land for butterflies, (2) indicate that meadow restoration is still
   possible even several decades after abandonment and (3) show that

   A few very rare species included in the Habitat Directive (Lycaena
   dispar, Lycaena helle, Maculinea teleius and Maculinea nausithous) were
   common on the wet grasslands in Krakow, thus the area should be
   protected. Moreover, it was shown that the presence and relative

Abstract = {{The effect of livestock grazing on the under-story vegetation in a
   Mediterranean Pinus nigra forest pasture in the Pyrenees was studied
   during 6 years, by comparing changes in herbaceous and shrub vegetation
   under cattle grazing conditions or in absence of livestock. Cattle
   grazed the pasture each year at a moderate stocking rate of 0.2 LU/ha,
   for 3 months in spring and 3 months in the autumn. Four 10 m x 10 m
   exclosures were set up in different locations in the range. Each year,
   at the end of the grazing season, herbage height and biomass and shrub
   number, volume and biomass were measured inside and outside the
   exclosures. Herbage quality was measured at the end of the study. After
   6 years, herbage biomass was much greater inside the exclosures (1730 kg
   DM/ha versus 679 kg DM/ha, p < 0.001) and had a higher proportion of
   dead vegetation and lower protein content than the grazed areas. Over
   the same period, shrub biomass increased substantially in the exclosures
   (528.3 kg DM/ha/year, p < 0.001), as the result of an increase in both
   shrub numbers and volume, while it remained constant in grazed areas. It
   is concluded that in the mountain pastures of the Pyrenees, cattle
   grazing at a moderate stocking rate can prevent shrub encroachment and
   the accumulation of dead inflammable herbaceous vegetation. It can not
   only maintain the quality and availability of the forage resource but
   also enhance the environmental and recreational value of the forest. (c)

Volume = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Although stocking rate is a key management variable influencing the
   structure and composition of pastures, only few studies have
   simultaneously analysed the seasonal patterns of pasture use by cattle,
   and the adjustments the animals make to maintain intake of a
   high-quality diet over the grazing season. Therefore, over a 3-year
   study we recorded diet selection, plot use and impact of heifers on
   sward structure and quality under three different stocking rates (0.6,
   1.0 and 1.4 livestock units (LU) per ha) in a species-rich mountain
   pasture of central France. Measurements were made on three occasions
   between early June and the end of September each year Overall, heifers
   selected for bites dominated by legumes or forbs, and against
   reproductive grass whatever the stocking rate or season. Selection for
   tall mixed (P < 0.05), short mixed (P < 0.05) and short pure grass bites
   (P < 0.01) was more pronounced in plots grazed at the lowest stocking
   rate. Although heifers' selection for short patches decreased at the end
   of the season (P < 0.001), they continued to graze previously grazed
   areas, thus exhibiting a typical patch grazing' pattern, with the
   animals that grazed at the lowest stocking rate tending to better
   maintain their selection for short patches in September (treatment x
   period. P = 0. 078). Neither diet quality nor individual animal
   performance were affected by the different stocking rate treatments
   despite high variability in the quantity and quality of herbage offered
   and differences in diet selection. However, at the 1.4 LU per ha
   stocking rate, the quantity of forage available per animal at the end of
   the season, 0.79t dry matter (DM) per ha of green leaves with the median
   of sward height at 4.6cm, approached levels limiting cattle's ability to
   compensate for the effects of increasing stocking rate. In plots grazed
   at 0.6 LU per ha, the total herbage biomass remained higher than 3t DM
   per ha with more than 30\% of plot area still covered by reproductive
   grass patches at the end of the grazing season, which in the medium term
   should affect the botanical composition of these pastures. Sward
   heterogeneity was high in plots grazed at 1.0 LU per ha, with sufficient
   herbage availability (1.1t DM per ha of green leaves) to maintain animal
   performance, and more than 15\% of plot area was kept at a reproductive
   stage at the end of the grazing season. Hence, it could represent the
   optimal balance to satisfy both livestock production and conservation
   management objectives.}},

Abstract = {{Question: What relationship exists between productivity, plant species
   richness and livestock diet? Are the results dependent on scale?
   Location: A sheep-grazed Koelerio-Corynephoretea sandy habitat of the
   northern upper Rhine (Germany) as a low productivity model system.
   Methods: The investigation was carried out for three years at a fine
   scale (2 m(2)) and for two years at a broad scale (79 m(2)).
   Productivity was measured by means of weighed above-ground phytomass for
   fine scale and colour-infrared (CIR) aerial photographs of the same
   system for fine and broad scales. For both scales, total numbers of
   vascular plant species and numbers of endangered vascular plant species
   were extracted from current vegetation releves. Additionally, we
   obtained data on livestock diet (grazed phytomass, crude protein
   content).
   Results: Statistical analyses show an influence of the year on all
   variables; relationships between variables are not significant in ever),
   year. Species richness and number of endangered species are negatively
   related to productivity at fine scale while crude protein content and
   grazed phytomass are positively related to productivity. At the broad
   scale the diversity-productivity relationship shows a `hump' with
   highest species numbers in middle pioneer stages: numbers of endangered
   species are highest in all pioneer stages.
   Conclusions: We found a strong impact of scale and year on the
   diversity-productivity relationship. It is inappropriate to analyse only
   small plots (2 m(2)). and it is necessary to study different years. This
   vegetation complex is dependent on grazing impact; thus there is an
   inversely proportional relationship between nature conservation value
   (high diversity) and livestock nutrition.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Questions: Is it possible to render the species pool concept operational
   for cultural landscape management and restoration?
   Location: Hordaland and Sogn \& Fjordane counties, western Norway.
   Methods: An initial regional species list, based on information on the
   distribution of species and habitats in the Norwegian flora. was
   filtered using information on target communities and species lists from
   95 sites in the region. Owing to the importance of both mowing and
   grazing Ellenberg indicator values were not used in the identification
   process.
   Results: The final regional species pool consisted of 227 species, of
   which 194 were extracted from the flora, while 33 agricultural landscape
   species were added from the actual pool or from a list of species in
   additional hay meadows. Some of the 33 species were regular inhabitants
   of hay meadows, others were rare in the region. The regional species
   pool list includes information on each species on demands when
   hydrology, nutrients and base saturation in the soil is concerned, and
   whether or not they are characteristic for either of the boreal or
   boreo-nemoral vegetation zones.
   Conclusions: Specialist knowledge was an advantage when adding cultural
   landscape species other than meadow species of the flora; 77 species
   were documented only by the flora, interesting from the point of view of
   restoration as this part of the pool would not have been found by just
   adding species lists. The diversity of the now isolated hay meadow sites
   in the region may be kept up by replacing the lost natural invasion by
   an artificial one, using local seed mixtures and transplants.}},

   Location: Semi-arid Mediterranean grasslands of Jordan.
   Methods: Vegetation. litter, bare soil and rock cover were compared
   among four management types - free grazing and protected from grazing
   with three levels of tree cover. Species composition. plant cover,
   species richness and evenness were used to evaluate differences in
   vegetation among management types. Species composition differences among

   Results: Semi-arid Mediterranean grasslands harbour appreciable levels

   indicating the high resilience against and adaptation to grazing:
   however. grazing affected species composition and cover parameters.
   Afforestation seems to protect soil through higher litter cover but its
   impact on plant biodiversity was negative and markedly affected species
   composition.
   Conclusions: Neither protection from grazing or massive afforestation
   alone are sufficient for conserving biodiversity in this system. A
   management model is suggested where the landscape should be maintained

Abstract = {{Question: Which one of the two mainly used mowing regimes along road
   verges, mowing once or twice a year is a better option regarding,
   flowering and seed-producing success of grassland species and plant
   species in general?
   Location: Southeast Finland.
   Methods: Plant species composition, flowering and seed production
   success were studied in road verges (1) mown once in August and (2) mown
   at the end of June and August. Flowering shoots were counted and
   phenological phases were estimated four times during a growing season.
   Results: The numbers of flowering or seed-producing species and shoots
   indicated that mowing once a year corresponding to the timing of
   traditional management was markedly better than mowing twice a year. The
   difference between the management groups was greatest at the end of July
   when the number of flowering species was 43\% and the number of
   flowering and seed-producing shoots 76\% less after the first mowing
   than in the still unmown sites. The species avoided early cutting either
   through the timing of flowering or due to their growth form. Early
   season mowing had no effect on the occurrence and seed-producing success
   of grassland species and the first flowering species. Seed production of
   grasses succeeded poorly in the verges mown twice.
   Conclusion: Mowing once in August resulted in higher seed production in
   general, but mowing twice a season might be a better way to manage young
   verges on nutrient-rich soils. The useful qualities of the management
   options should be considered locally when planning road verge
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Alpine grasslands in the Southern Carpathian Mts, Romania, harbour an
   extraordinarily high diversity of plants and invertebrates, including
   Carpathic endemics. In the past decades, intensive sheep grazing has
   caused a dramatic decrease in biodiversity and even led to eroded soils
   at many places in the Carpathians. Because of limited food resources,
   sheep are increasingly forced to graze on steep slopes, which were
   formerly not grazed by livestock and are considered as local
   biodiversity hotspots. We examined species richness, abundance and
   number of endemic vascular plants and terrestrial gastropods on steep
   slopes that were either grazed by sheep or ungrazed by livestock in two
   areas of the Southern Carpathians. On calcareous soils in the Bucegi
   Mts, a total of 177 vascular plant and 19 gastropod species were
   recorded. Twelve plant species (6.8\%) and three gastropod species
   (15.8\%) were endemic to the Carpathians. Grazed sites had lower plant
   and gastropod species richness than ungrazed sites. Furthermore, grazed
   sites harboured fewer gastropod species endemic to the Carpathians than
   ungrazed sites. On acid soils in the Fagaras Mts, a total of 96 vascular
   plant and nine gastropod species were found. In this mountain area,
   however, grazed and ungrazed sites did not differ in species richness,
   abundance and number of endemic plant and gastropod species. Our
   findings confirm the high biodiversity of grasslands on steep slopes in
   the Southern Carpathian Mts and caution against increasing grazing
   pressure in these refuges for relic plants and gastropods as well as for
   other invertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{The reformation of the Swedish agricultural system, about 150 years ago,
   drastically changed the use of semi-natural grasslands. Grassland plant
   diversity has declined due to abandonment, changed management methods
   and production intensification. Current diversity patterns are thus a
   result of historical and current land use in combination. In this study
   we investigate the relative importance of historical grassland
   management and current land use for grassland plant diversity. The
   distribution of 128 grassland plant species in an agricultural landscape
   in southwest Sweden was analysed in relation to current land use and
   land use in three historical time periods; the 18th and the 19th century
   and around 1960. Land use during the three historical periods was also
   combined into land-use sequences. Four diversity estimates were used:
   number of grassland species, number of grassland specialists,
   Shannon-Wiener index on the specialists and total cover/hectare of
   specialists. Historical land use - especially 18th century and the
   land-use sequences - explained more of the variation among study sites
   than did current land use. Continuity of a specific management type was
   important for grassland plants as indicated by highest diversities being
   found in pastures continuously grazed since the 18th century. Former hay
   meadows, currently grazed, did not differ in any diversity estimate from
   abandoned hay meadows, indicating that change of management from mowing
   to grazing a century ago may cause diversity declines similar to
   abandonment some 40 years ago. Limited artificial fertilisation in the
   managed areas may have contributed to this effect. Further decline in
   grassland biodiversity in the agricultural landscape is expected because
   a substantial proportion of grassland plant populations occur in
   abandoned areas. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The sustainable management of the W Regional park and its peripheral
   areas is based on a trade-off between conservation and the generation of
   economic income for local populations. This work is a pilot study for
   the identification of ecological indicators to monitor ecosystem health
   in Sudanian Savannah ecosystems. Ecological indicators are needed to
   warrant the efficiency of the protection measures, particularly in the
   mosaic landscapes Of the peripheral areas. Two insect families
   (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae (Cetoniinae) and Lepj.doptera: Nymphalidae)
   were trapped along transects crossing landuse units submitted to various
   human pressures (none, hunting, traditional and intensive crops,
   grazing) in two countries (Burkina Faso and Benin). Plant species
   richness was found to be correlated with the abundance of four
   fruit-feeding insect species and with the fruit-feeding butterflies
   species richness, but not with the Cetoniinae species richness. The
   abundance of Nymphalidae species generally dropped with human
   activities, but that of Cetoniinae species followed the intermediate
   disturbance theory. The likely impact of the various management
   practises on the general ecosystem health is discussed, as is the
   potential value of fruitfeeding insects as bioindicators and the points
   that still need to be clarified. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Certain species play particularly large roles in ecosystems, and are
   often referred to as keystones. However, little is known about the
   interactive effects of these species where they co-occur. Prairie dogs
   (Cynomys spp.) and banner-tailed kangaroo rats Dipodomys spectabilis are
   commonly considered keystone species of grassland ecosystems, creating a
   mosaic of unique habitats on the landscape through ecosystem engineering
   and herbivory. We examined the separate and interactive effects of these
   species on the structure of grassland arthropod communities. We
   conducted a cross-site study at two locations in the northern Chihuahuan
   Desert, and evaluated the impacts of these rodents on ground-dwelling
   arthropod and grasshopper communities in areas where prairie dogs and
   kangaroo rats co-occurred compared to areas where each rodent species
   occurred alone. Our results demonstrate that prairie dogs (C. gunnisoni
   and C. ludovicianus) and banner-tailed kangaroo rats had keystone-level
   impacts on arthropod communities both separately and interactively.
   Their burrow systems provided important habitats for multiple trophic
   and taxonomic groups of arthropods, and increased overall arthropod
   abundance and species richness. Many arthropods also were attracted to
   the aboveground habitats around the mounds and across the landscapes
   where the rodents occurred. Detritivores, predators, ants, grasshoppers,
   and rare rodent burrow inhabitants were especially associated with
   prairie dog and kangaroo rat activity. The impacts of prairie dogs and
   kangaroo rats were unique, and the habitats they created supported
   different assemblages of arthropods. Where both rodent species
   co-occurred, there was greater heterogeneity and arthropod diversity on
   the landscape. Our results suggest that the interaction of multiple
   keystones, especially those with engineering roles, results in unique
   and more diverse communities in time and space.}},

Title = {{From plant neighbourhood to landscape scales: how grazing modifies

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{191}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{185-198}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The interactive effect of grazing and soil resources on plant species
   richness and coexistence has been predicted to vary across spatial
   scales. When resources are not limiting, grazing should reduce
   competitive effects and increase colonisation and richness at fine
   scales. However, at broad scales richness is predicted to decline due to
   loss of grazing intolerant species. We examined these hypotheses in
   grasslands of southern Australia that varied in resources and ungulate
   grazing intensity since farming commenced 170 years ago. Fine-scale
   species richness was slightly greater in more intensively grazed upper
   slope sites with high nutrients but low water supply compared to those
   that were moderately grazed, largely due to a greater abundance of
   exotic species. At broader scales, exotic species richness declined with
   increasing grazing intensity whether nutrients or water supply were low
   or high. Native species richness declined at all scales in response to
   increasing grazing intensity and greater resource supply. Grazing also
   reduced fine-scale heterogeneity in native species richness and although
   exotics were also characterised by greater heterogeneity at fine scales,
   grazing effects varied across scales. In these grasslands patterns of
   plant species richness did not match predictions at all scales and this
   is likely to be due to differing responses of native and exotic species
   and their relative abundance in the regional species pool. Over the past
   170 years intolerant native species have been eliminated from areas that
   are continually and heavily grazed, whereas transient, light grazing
   increases richness of both exotics and natives. The results support the
   observation that the processes and scales at which they operate differ
   between coevolved ungulate-grassland systems and those in transition due
   to recent invasion of herbivores and associated plant species.}},

Abstract = {{Land use change associated with agriculture is arguably the greatest
   threat to global biodiversity. There is a need to develop management
   strategies and policies that meet conservation and agricultural
   objectives. One approach argued to have merit is intensification within
   productive parts of the landscape to allow increased land saving for
   conservation of biodiversity. To date there has been little empirical
   examination of this hypothesis. Livestock production has been the
   dominant land use across southern Australia for the last 100-200 years.
   This has contributed to biodiversity loss and other environmental issues
   associated with removal of native perennial vegetation. Livestock
   producers are under increasing pressure to maintain farm profits and A
   is argued that intensification through fertiliser application can
   increase profitability and allow more land to be set-aside for
   conservation management. We examined relationships between native
   vegetation composition and past and current farm management and combined
   this with assessments of current productivity and potential for
   intensification using either fertiliser application or changes in
   grazing management. Intensive management associated with phosphate
   fertiliser application results in exponential declines in native plant
   diversity, although intermediate levels of livestock grazing often have
   little impact on plant diversity when nutrient levels are low. Options
   for future intensification, via fertiliser application, often coincide
   with areas of high native plant diversity. Small set-asides, off-set by
   intensification using fertiliser application, are only affordable on
   farms currently managing below potential carrying capacity. These farms
   are often those that support extensive areas of native vegetation. At
   both the paddock and farm scale, increasing productivity via fertiliser
   application is likely to require intensification on even more land and
   could come at a cost to biodiversity. In contrast, improving grazing
   management across broad scales is likely to result in enhanced
   profitability and could also benefit native vegetation. Extensive
   management may be necessary to maintain biodiversity and prevent further
   long-term degradation of the resource base. Crown Copyright (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Grassland farmers face many challenges in pasture management including
   improving sustainability, reducing inputs of fertilizers and pesticides,
   and protecting soil resources. In this paper we provide our perspective
   on managing plant diversity within and among pastures as one tool to aid
   producers in meeting these challenges. Pasture ecosystems can be highly
   diverse, with a complex array of organisms contributing to ecosystem
   functioning. Within the broad range of plant and animal biodiversity in
   pastures, plant species diversity may be the most amenable to
   manipulation or management. Reported benefits of plant diversity in
   grasslands include: increased forage production, greater ecosystem
   stability in response to disturbance, and reduced invasion by exotic
   species such as weeds. Some view diversity as a sort of insurance policy
   where different species contribute in their own time or can take the
   place of species that fail from stress or mismanagement. Using mixtures
   of several forages in pastures, in some instances, can improve forage
   yield and reduce weed invasions. Pasture management for increased plant
   species diversity, however, is not simply mixing and planting as many
   forage species as possible. The kinds and amounts of different forage
   species along with their arrangement within and among pastures at the
   farm scale are critical features that must be considered. Tools must be
   developed to determine the appropriate species mixtures for varying
   soils, landscapes, climate and purposes to fulfill multiple functions
   for producers.}},

Abstract = {{A number of field experiments were conducted from 1986 to 2003 to
   investigate the dynamics of soil physical and chemical properties as
   well as vegetation succession characteristics during the grassland
   desertification process under sheep grazing. Results indicate that fine
   silt (0.01-0.001 mm) removal and medium sand (0.5-0.25 mm) increase
   occurred early in the desertification process resulting in coarser
   surface soil. The fine sand (0.25-0.05 mm) was the major (33.7-68.4\%)
   soil fractions element throughout the process. Changes in soil fractions
   were associated with a decline in soil fertility as the natural
   grassland shifted to a desertified landscape. The organic matter
   concentration decreased significantly by 94\%, 89\% and 69\%,
   respectively, in the 0-5, 5-10 and 10-30cm soil layers. The
   desertification effects on total soil N followed the same trend as the
   organic matter. Total soil P and K concentrations decreased only
   slightly and were consistent early in the desertification process. Soil
   bulk density increased companied with the decline of soil porosity and
   compaction as the desertification process continued. Species diversity
   declined both in the plant community and the soil seed bank, and species
   richness decreased by 56\%. Three successional stages were identified,
   with bunchgrass communities being the first, followed by the growth of
   rhizomous grasses, and then sandy species and annual plant communities.
   In conclusion, grassland desertification was accompanied by severe soil
   erosion, soil nutrition decline and species diversity losses. (c) 2007

Title = {{Disturbance is the principal alpha-scale filter determining niche
   differentiation, coexistence and biodiversity in an alpine community}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{698-706}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{1. Many current biodiversity theories assume that resource competition
   determines niche segregation and thus coexistence within communities
   (i.e. at the alpha-scale). However, the action of disturbance, creating
   heterogeneous environments and suppressing potential dominants, may also
   be important for biodiversity maintenance.
   2. Hypothesis: subordinate species exhibit primarily opportunistic
   (ruderal) survival strategies, with increasing disturbance intensity
   constraining dominant species - favouring opportunistic strategies and
   thus functional and species diversity.
   3. The diversity, character and frequency of strategies in an alpine
   sedge-dominated vascular plant community were quantified in situ using
   CSR (competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal) classification, and compared
   with a pasture in the same alpine vegetation belt (i.e. with additional
   disturbance). Adaptive trends were confirmed by independent multivariate
   analysis {[}detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and non-metric
   multidimensional scaling (NMDS)].
   4. The extremely stress-tolerant sedge Carex curvula (C : S : R = 17.2 :
   72.9 : 9.9\%) dominated the relatively undisturbed community (frequency
   = 52\%), with 32 subordinates (typically < 5\%) exhibiting a functional
   spectrum encompassing stress tolerance to ruderalism, but not
   competitive strategies. With grazing, the community exhibited weaker
   co-dominance by five species, greater biodiversity (76 species) and
   greater functional diversity, characterized by larger numbers of
   ruderals and some competitive-ruderals. The principal variation in both
   DCA1 and NMDS1 for both communities directly reflected CSR strategy
   spectra, confirmed by Spearman's correlation.
   5. Dominance by stress-tolerators and restricted functional diversity
   demonstrates habitat-level (beta-scale) functional convergence in
   response to stress. A spectrum of S to R strategies demonstrates
   alpha-scale functional divergence in response to differential stress and
   disturbance. Grazing suppresses potentially dominant species and favours
   diversity, with the additional presence of competitive-ruderals
   suggestive of a more intricate niche topology including more relaxed
   abiotic opportunities.
   6. Natural communities are not necessarily structured according to the
   rules of resource competition models, as these fail to account for
   disturbance and facilitation processes.}},

Abstract = {{Improving understanding of the connections between vegetation,
   herbivory, and ecosystem function offers a fundamental challenge in
   contemporary terrestrial ecology. Using exclosures constructed during
   the late 1950s, we examined effects of grazing by wild and domestic
   herbivores on plant community structure, aboveground herbaceous primary
   production, and nutrient cycling at six sites in semi-arid, sagebrush
   rangelands during 2001-2002 in Colorado, USA. Enclosures provided three
   treatments: no grazing, grazing by wild ungulates only, and grazing by
   wild and domestic ungulates. Excluding all grazing caused an increase in
   shrub cover (F = 4.97, P = 0.033) and decrease in bare ground (F = 4.74,
   P = 0.037), but also a decrease in plant species richness (F = 6.19, P =
   0.018) and plant diversity (F = 7.93, P = 0.008). Effects of wild
   ungulate grazing on plant cover and diversity were intermediate to the
   effects of combined domestic and wild grazing. Aboveground net primary
   production was higher in both grazed treatments than in the ungrazed one
   (F-wild + (domestic) = 2.98, P = 0.0936 and Fwild only = 3.55, P =
   0.0684). We were unable to detect significant effects of grazing on
   other ecosystem states and processes including C:N ratios of standing
   crops, N mineralization potential, or nitrification potential. Best
   approximating models revealed positive correlation between N
   availability and herbaceous cover and a negative correlation between
   herbaceous primary production and the ratio of shrub-herb cover and
   plant diversity. We conclude that ungulate herbivory, including both
   wild and domestic ungulates, had significant effects on plant community
   structure and ecosystem function during this 42-year span. Responses to
   the wild ungulate treatment were consistently intermediate to responses
   to the no grazing and wild + domestic grazing treatments. However, we
   were unable to detect statistical difference between effects of wild
   ungulates alone and wild ungulates in combination with livestock.}},

   simulated rainy ENSO events in combination with herbivores and shade
   have on the composition of a semiarid herbaceous community in
   north-central Chile. We hypothesized that water pulses, such as those
   associated with rainy ENSO events could trigger significant changes in
   the relative abundance of exotic and native herbaceous species.
   Specifically, we predicted an increase in native grasses and a reduction
   in the abundance of exotic species, especially prostrate forbs, if water
   pulses were combined with reduced herbivory. We found that herbivory by
   small mammals, especially introduced European rabbits (Oryctolagus
   cuniculus) and hares (Lepus europaeus), have an overwhelming effect on
   species abundance and composition in this semiarid herbaceous community.
   Herbivore exclusion produced an overall increase in herb density and
   biomass mostly due to the extraordinary growth of tall native grasses
   (especially Bromus berterianus) that outcompeted small prostrate forbs
   (both native and exotic ones), and small exotic grasses (Koeleria
   pleoides, Schismus arabicus). Our results suggest that it might be
   possible to enhance the recovery of native grasses by applying efficient
   herbivore control during rainy years such as those associated with ENSO
   events although a negative consequence would be the loss of small native
   forbs, which greatly contribute to the richness of herbaceous
   communities in semiarid ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between plant species richness and productivity on a
   watershed in southern French Alps was studied. Few studies have
   considered looking at previous land use when determining the
   relationship between species richness and biomass. The results indicate
   that productivity is a decreasing loglinear function of succession age.
   At a landscape level, the overall relationship between specific richness
   and productivity was found to be a log-linear function, as well as at a
   local scale, thus not in conformity with hump-back relationship usually
   presented. Moreover for the same level of productivity, the ancient
   forests would contain more species than the recent forests. In
   grasslands and shrubland, limiting resources and microtopography control
   the species richness. The peak of richness observed in grasslands for a
   productivity between 100 and 200 g.m(-2) indicated that grassland and
   shrub communities are probably unsaturated. Broadly it appears that the
   grazing has no overall effect on productivity nor on species richness
   per m(2) level. However sward dominance by Brachypodium pinnatum makes
   fall both the productivity and the specific richness. Therefore
   consequences for biodiversity conservation is questionable.}},

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that intensive grazing management, aimed at
   maintaining plant diversity, might not be the optimal choice to preserve
   diversity of insects in semi-natural pastures. In the present study the
   behaviour of flower visiting insects was studied in two semi-natural
   pastures in central Sweden. Two grazing treatments were established with
   one grazed from mid-May, ``continuous{''}, and one grazed from mid-July,
   ``late{''}. Flower visitors were followed for 9 weeks in summer 2003 in
   7 pairs of 5 x 5 m plots on two sides of a fence dividing the two
   grazing treatments. Visitor behaviour was studied on three decision
   levels between: (1) habitats, (2) flowers and (3) activities on flowers.
   The pattern varied between decision levels: More species and individual
   visitors chose to forage in the late grazing treatment. Visitation rate
   and flower constancy did not differ between treatments and was related,
   to a large extent, to plant species richness. In relation to flowers,
   insects utilized a broader diversity of activities in the late grazing
   treatment. All patterns were consistent across sites and during the
   whole study period. The differences in pollinator abundance and
   activities on flowers were best explained by the higher abundance of
   flowers. It is suggested that studies of insect behaviour may be a
   useful tool when deciding on management recommendations. Late grazing is
   recommended as a useful management regime and might potentially function
   as a substitute for mowing in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Although insects are crucial for maintaining ecosystem function, our
   understanding of their overall response to human activity remains
   limited. This is no less true of dung-burying beetles (Coleoptera:
   Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae), which provide a suite of critical ecosystem
   functions and services, yet but face multiple conservation threats,
   particularly from landscape conversion. Here we use a review and
   meta-analysis to synthesize the current knowledge concerning response to
   tropical forest modification and fragmentation of dung beetles
   (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae: Scarabaeinae). For every modified habitat
   type and individual forest fragment across 33 studies, we calculated six
   dung beetle community parameters, standardized relative to intact
   tropical forest. We organized modified habitats along an approximate
   disturbance gradient ranging from selectively logged, late and early
   secondary forest, through agroforestry, tree plantations, to annual
   crops, cattle pastures and clear-cuts. Secondary forests, selectively
   logged forest and agroforests supported rich communities with many
   intact forest species, while cattle pastures and clear-cuts contained
   fewer species overall with few forest-dwelling species. Abundance
   generally declined with increasing modification, but was quite variable.
   Communities in open habitats were often characterized by hyper-abundance
   of a small number of small-bodied species, leading to low evenness.
   Across fragmentation studies, dung beetle species richness, abundance
   and evenness declined in smaller forest fragments. Richness and
   abundance sometimes declined in more isolated fragments, although this
   response appeared to depend on matrix quality. Across both habitat
   modification and fragmentation studies, geographic location and
   landscape context appeared to modify dung beetle response by influencing
   the available pool of colonists. We discuss potential underlying
   mechanisms and conclude with recommendations for management and
   conservation and for future research. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Landscape alterations by humans can change patterns of parasite
   transmission. Depending on the type alteration and the life histories of
   parasites and hosts, parasitism may increase or decrease. To investigate
   whether parasitism in tropical amphibians was associated with land use
   change, I studied three species of amphibians, Rana vaillanti,
   Eleutherodactylus fitzingeri, and Smilisca puma from the Province of
   Heredia, Costa Rica, in the Atlantic lowlands. Frogs were collected and
   examined for parasites during the rainy seasons of 2001-2003 from sites
   in forest or clear-cut cattle pastures. The abundances of five species
   of parasites and parasite species richness of R. vaillanti were
   significantly higher in pasture habitat. A single parasite species
   shared by E. fitzingeri and S. puma showed a trend of increased
   abundance in pasture habitats. Overall, the abundances of six parasite
   species (three trematodes, an intestinal nematode, an encysted nematode,
   and a filarial nematode) were higher in pastures, while two species
   (trematodes) were higher in forest. This study suggests that land use
   activities in tropical regions affects the abundance and richness of
   amphibian parasites. Converting forest to pasture may impact the
   abundance of amphibian parasites because subsequent water quality
   changes (e.g. eutrophication, higher pH) often enhance habitat and
   resources for intermediate hosts (e.g. snails, mosquitoes) involved in
   parasite life cycles. Aquatic amphibians (e.g. R. vaillanti) may be
   particularly prone to experiencing increases in parasitism in
   agricultural habitats due to the positive relationship between many
   aquatic intermediate hosts and water quality changes associated with
   agricultural land use. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{In the 1950s Charles Elton hypothesized that more diverse communities
   should be less susceptible to invasion by exotic species
   (biodiversity-invasibility hypothesis). The biodiversity-invasibility
   hypothesis postulates that species-rich communities are less vulnerable
   to invasion because vacant niches are less common and the intensity of
   interspecific competition is more severe. Field studies were conducted
   at two sites, a logged site and an unlogged site in Santa Rosa County,
   Florida, U.S.A, to test Elton's hypothesis using cogongrass (Imperata
   cylindrica), a non-indigenous grass invading large areas of the
   Southeastern United States. The logged site was under 17-year-old
   loblolly pine prior to clear cutting. The unlogged site, a longleaf pine
   forest, was at the Blackwater River State Forest. Both the logged site
   and unlogged site showed no significant relationship between the rate of
   cogongrass spread and native plant species richness, functional
   richness, and cover of the invaded community. Increased species or
   functional richness may increase the use of resources; however, the
   extensive rhizome/root network possessed by cogongrass and its ability
   to thrive under shade may allow for its persistence in a diverse
   community. The results from both the logged and unlogged sites do not
   support the general hypothesis of Elton that invasion resistance and
   compositional stability increase with diversity. Biodiversity does not
   appear to be an important factor for cogongrass invasion in the southern
   United States. Extrinsic factors in this study prevent the ability to
   draw a defined causal relationship between native plant diversity and
   invasibility. Underlying reasons for why no relationship was observed
   may be simply due to the tremendous competitive ability of cogongrass or
   the narrow range of species richness, functional richness and cover
   observed in our study.}},

Abstract = {{The abandonment of management in Swiss fen meadows has reduced their
   plant species diversity and the fitness of some typical fen species. We
   examined whether the resumption of mowing can reverse these effects, and
   if so, which mechanisms are responsible for community change; we also
   tested whether restoration success depends on the duration since
   abandonment. Experimental mowing was applied to 15 montane fen meadows
   of NE Switzerland that had been abandoned for 4-35 years. After two
   years of mowing, plant species richness was 11 \% higher in mown plots
   (2 m(2)) than in fallow plots, approaching levels of neighbouring
   continuously managed fen meadows. In particular, experimental mowing
   significantly increased the number of fen indicator species (+15 \%) as
   well as herbs and woody species (seedlings and saplings), while grass,
   sedge and rush species richness was not affected. Mowing had little
   effect on aboveground biomass, but strongly reduced litter mass (-50\%)
   and canopy height (-20\%). Seedling densities of two common species
   showed opposite responses to mowing: they increased in Carex davalliana
   and decreased in Succisa pratensis, approaching values of continuously
   mown fen meadows. Duration since abandonment had no significant effect
   on any of the variables. Our results demonstrate a rapid recovery of
   montane fen plant communities irrespective of the duration since
   abandonment (up to 35 years). We conclude that the restoration of
   pre-fallow plant community composition is likely to be successful if
   site conditions (hydrology, nutrient status) remain intact and if common
   habitat specialists are still present in the vegetation and/or seed
   bank.}},

   of many subalpine pastures during the last decades. To understand the
   dynamics of natural reforestation and to evaluate how this change
   affects plant species diversity, we described the vegetation of a wooded
   pasture in the central Swiss Alps (Sembrancher, Valais) using the
   integrated synusial method. Based on stratified vegetation releves in 27
   plots, we defined 11 community types at the synusial level (two
   tree-layer, five shrub-layer, and four herb-layer synusiae), and four
   community types at the phytocoenosis level (pasture, tall forbs and
   scrub, wooded pasture and forest). The spatial distribution of these
   four phytocoenoses suggests that they represent successional stages
   after abandonment, and that the pathway of vegetation succession depends
   on the aspect. We suppose that on northern oriented, cool and shady
   locations, abandoned pastures first develop towards tall-forb meadows
   and scrub with Alnus viridis, and then to a preforested stage with Picea
   abies and Larix decidua. In contrast, on western oriented, warm and
   sunny location, Larix decidua (mainly) and Picea abies directly colonize
   the abandoned pastures, but further succession finally leads to the same
   pre-forested stage as on northern slopes. Plant species richness was
   highest in open areas and decreased by 25 \% as tree cover increased
   from 6 \% to 65 \%. According to our successional model, plant species
   diversity is lost more rapidly on northern slopes (with species-poor
   green alder scrub) than on western slopes (with species-rich young larch
   forests), suggesting that northern slopes most urgently need an
   appropriate grazing management.}},

Abstract = {{Reintroduction of fire and grazing, alone or in combination, has
   increasingly been recognized as central to the restoration of North
   American mixed-grass and tallgrass prairies. Although ecological studies
   of these systems are abundant, they have generally been observational,
   or if experimental, have focused on plant species diversity. Species
   diversity measures alone are not sufficient to inform management, which
   often has goals associated with life form groups and individual species.
   We examined the effects of prescribed fire, light cattle grazing, and a
   combination of fire and grazing on three vegetation components: species
   diversity, groups of species categorized by life form, and individual
   species. We evaluated how successful these three treatments were in
   achieving specific management goals for prairies in the Iowa Loess Hills
   (U.S.A.). The grazing treatment promoted the greatest overall species
   richness, whereas grazing and burning and grazing treatments resulted in
   the lowest cover by woody species. Burning alone best achieved the
   management goals of increasing the cover and diversity of native species
   and reducing exotic forb and (predominantly exotic) cool-season grass
   cover. Species-specific responses to treatments appeared idiosyncratic
   (i.e., within each treatment there existed a set of species attaining
   their highest frequency) and nearly half of uncommon species were
   present in only one treatment. Because all management goals were not
   achieved by any one treatment, we conclude that management in this
   region may need refining. We suggest that a mosaic of burning and
   grazing (alone and in combination) may provide the greatest
   landscape-level species richness; however, this strategy would also
   likely promote the persistence of exotic species. Our results support
   the need to consider multiple measures, including species-specific
   responses, when planning and evaluating management.}},

Title = {{The importance of sward architectural complexity in structuring
   predatory and phytophagous invertebrate assemblages}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{302-311}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Although the importance of plant community assemblages in structuring
   invertebrate assemblages is well known, the role that architectural
   complexity plays is less well understood. In particular, direct
   empirical data for a range of invertebrate taxa showing how functional
   groups respond to plant architecture is largely absent from the
   literature.
   2. The significance of sward architectural complexity in determining the
   species richness of predatory and phytophagous functional groups of
   spiders, beetles, and true bugs, sampled from 135 field margin plots
   over 2 years was tested. The present study compares the relative
   importance of sward architectural complexity to that of plant community
   assemblage.
   3. Sward architectural complexity was found to be a determinant of
   species richness for all phytophagous and predatory functional groups.
   When individual species responses were investigated, 62.5\% of the
   spider and beetle species, and 50.0\% of the true bugs responded to
   sward architectural complexity.
   4. Interactions between sward architectural complexity and plant
   community assemblage indicate that the number of invertebrate species
   supported by the plant community alone could be increased by
   modification of sward architecture. Management practices could therefore
   play a key role in diversifying the architectural structure of existing
   floral assemblages for the benefit of invertebrate assemblages.
   5. The contrasting effects of sward architecture on invertebrate
   functional groups characterised by either direct (phytophagous species)
   or indirect (predatory species) dependence on plant communities is
   discussed. It is suggested that for phytophagous taxa, plant community
   assemblage alone is likely to be insufficient to ensure successful
   species colonisation or persistence without appropriate development of
   sward architecture.}},

Abstract = {{The steppes of the Mediterranean Basin, traditionally managed since
   ancient times, have been drastically degraded by recent human
   activities, and are a valuable model to study the impact of present and
   past anthropogenic disturbances. Climate and edaphic constraints and
   free sheep grazing have contributed for over 6000 years to the
   development of a steppe unique to France, but similar to many others in
   the Mediterranean Basin. This steppe is increasingly threatened by both
   industrialization and cultivation, and formerly-cultivated plots
   developed less species-rich vegetation than the steppe. Here, sampling
   with pitfall traps showed that formerly-cultivated plots hosted more
   diverse beetle assemblages owing to the presence of ruderal plants,
   which had greater nutritional value and hosted more phytophagous
   insects, beetles or other groups, enhancing prey diversity. The steppe
   had a less species-rich assemblage, but included many species typical of
   arid areas, some of which are threatened. Former disturbances led to the
   settlement of ubiquitous species, which increased the overall species
   richness, but decreased the biological value for conservation.
   Conservationists have to decide whether they would rather maintain
   beetle species diversity or biological value.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction of grazing intensity and the use of traditional instead of
   commercial breeds has frequently been recommended to meet biodiversity
   and production goals in sustainable grazing systems in Europe. To test
   the impact of such practices across a range of contrasting grassland
   types, integrated measurements of foraging behaviour, agronomic
   production and botanical, structural and invertebrate biodiversity were
   made over three years on four sites in the UK, Germany, France and
   Italy. The sites in the UK and Germany were inesotrophic grassland With
   high productivity and low to moderate initial levels of plant diversity,
   and were grazed by cattle. The French site was a semi-natural,
   species-rich grassland grazed by cattle. The Italian site contained a
   wider range in plant diversity, from species-rich to rnesotrophic
   grassland, and was grazed by sheep. The treatments were: MC, moderate
   grazing intensity with a commercial breed - this was designed to utilize
   herbage growth for optimum livestock production; LC, lenient grazing
   intensity with a commercial breed - this was designed to increase
   biodiversity by not fully utilizing herbage growth; and LT, lenient
   grazing intensity with a traditional breed - this was also designed to
   increase biodiversity. Neither fertilizers nor pesticides were applied.
   The nutritive value of the herbage and the performance of the livestock
   were measured. Mean stocking rates were proportionately 0-30-0-40 lower
   and mean sward heights and herbage mass on offer were 0.30-0.50 higher
   on the LC and LT treatments compared with the MC treatment. The
   proportion of live and dead material, and leaves and stems in the
   herbage, its chemical composition and nutritive value were little
   affected by the treatments. Individual livestock performance, measured
   as fiveweight gain, showed no consistent response to treatment. In
   Germany, performance on the MC treatment was slightly lower than on the
   LC and LT treatments but no such difference was found on the sites in
   the other countries. Livestock breed did not have a strong effect on
   livestock performance. In the UK and France the traditional breeds had a
   lower performance but. this was not the case in Germany or Italy.
   Livestock performance per ha of the LC and LT treatments was up to 0-40
   lower than of the MC treatment. It is concluded that
   biodiversity-targeted extensive grazing systems have potential to be
   integrated into intensive livestock production systems because the
   individual livestock performance reaches a similar level compared to a
   moderate grazing intensity. Traditional breeds did not have a production
   advantage over commercial breeds on extensively managed pastures.}},

   intensity using a commercial breed, (ii) a more lenient grazing
   intensity with a commercial breed and (iii) a more lenient intensity
   with a traditional breed. Livestock at all sites preferentially selected
   bites containing legumes and forbs, and also short rather than tall
   vegetative patches. Grazing intensity affected not only diet consumed,
   largely reflecting the different availabilities of dietary components,
   but also some differences in diet selection. Livestock grazing the more
   productive mesotrophic grasslands more frequently exploited short
   patches of higher nutritive value, which is expected to reinforce the
   spatial heterogeneity of the pastures. Studies in the UK and Germany
   also revealed that steers showed a more pronounced selection for short
   patches at the lenient grazing intensity. More homogeneous grazing by
   livestock on the semi-natural grasslands with finescale heterogeneity is
   likely to decrease their spatial heterogeneity. There were few
   differences in the choices made by commercial and traditional breed
   livestock. North Devon steers in the UK expressed a greater selection
   for tall grass-forb bites than Charolais x Holstein crossbreds, whereas
   traditional breeds appeared slightly less selective than commercial
   breeds at the other three sites.}},

   impact on plant biodiversity is an important issue in the design of
   grazing systems. This paper describes a study of the effect of two
   levels of grazing intensity combined with different animal breeds on
   plant biodiversity and sward structural diversity of semi-natural
   grasslands conducted over 3 years in the United Kingdom (UK), France
   (F), Germany (D) and Italy (I). There were three treatments at each
   site: moderate grazing intensity with a commercial breed (MC), lenient
   grazing intensity with a commercial breed (LC) and lenient grazing
   intensity with a traditional breed (LT). Grazing livestock were cattle
   in the UK, F and D, and sheep in I. Only grazing intensity had clear
   effects on vegetation diversity, the effects depending on site-specific
   vegetation characteristics. In more diverse pastures with finer scale
   heterogeneity in F and 1, there was little effect of the treatments. in
   less diverse swards with higher grass dominance and coarse-scale
   heterogeneity, the number of species decreased from initial levels on
   the lenient grazing intensity treatments (treatments LC and LT), because
   of increased dominance of grasses reducing the cover of other species,
   particularly legumes. The structural diversity of the pastures was more
   affected by level of grazing intensity than botanical diversity. In more
   diverse, semi-natural grasslands, structural heterogeneity was not
   affected by the treatments. in less diverse, more productive swards,
   structural heterogeneity decreased where large patches were initially
   found on the UK site, and increased where smaller patches were initially
   found on the D site. It is concluded that management systems to conserve
   diversity need to consider carefully the background environment, and
   that more knowledge of the mechanisms involved is needed at farm and
   landscape scales.}},

   impact on animal diversity is important for the development of
   sustainable grazing systems. This paper tests the hypothesis that
   extensification of grazing management enhances animal diversity. Similar
   treatments were applied over a period of three years to sites in the UK,
   France, Germany and Italy. There were three treatments at each site:
   moderate grazing intensity with a commercial breed (MC), lenient grazing
   intensity with a commercial breed (LC) and lenient grazing intensity
   with a traditional breed (LT). Animal diversity was studied at the
   species level for birds, hares, butterflies and grasshoppers, and at
   higher taxonomic level for ground-dwelling arthropods. Bird and hare
   numbers were low and showed no overall treatment effects. Species
   richriess and abundance of butterflies and grasshoppers were higher for
   treatment LC than for treatment MC, both for species preferring short
   open grasslands and those preferring tall grasslands. There was no
   difference in the impact of commercial or traditional breeds. Most
   ground-dwelling arthropod groups did not show consistent treatment
   effects but some taxa showed site-specific responses, generally
   indicating a greater abundance at lenient grazing intensity. Overall,
   the study showed that lenient grazing intensity enhanced animal
   diversity on grasslands at a small scale within 3 years. By comparison,
   the effect of livestock breed differences was negligible. Follow-up
   research is needed to elucidate the processes leading to increased
   biodiversity in patch mosaics and to establish the generality of these
   findings at larger spatial scales and longer time scales.}},

Abstract = {{We examined trends over six consecutive spring seasons in three ``spring
   annual{''} herbs, Myosurus minimus subsp. novae-zelandiae
   (Ranunculaceae), Ceratocephala pungens (Ranunculaceae), and Myosotis
   pygmaea var. minutiflora (Boraginaceae), in terms of their habitats and
   site land uses in several rare, non-forest ecosystems. On dry
   hillslopes, saline soils, and turfs of ephemeral wetlands (including
   coastal turfs), Ceratocephala and Myosotis declined where sites were
   managed for conservation by removal of mammalian herbivores. Some
   populations of Myosurus declined only marginally or remained stable
   despite high cover of ruderal and weedy, herbaceous exotic plants. Loss
   of monitored populations during the study was offset by discoveries of
   additional populations of all three taxa. Statistical models of
   population trends suggest that in some instances spring annual
   populations benefit from farm animal and rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus
   cuniculus) disturbance of their habitats perhaps by 1) suppressing
   transitions to taller vegetation and retarding competition of invasive
   exotic plants and 2) maintaining nutrient supplementation from faeces
   lost with the extinction of ground-dwelling birds. Frequent seeds of all
   three taxa preserved in moa coprolites from several sites in Central
   Otago point to 1) the herbs' probable non-rarity in pre-human times and
   2) dispersal mutualisms and mediation of community ground cover by
   extinct ratites.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between above- and belowground invertebrate herbivores
   alter plant diversity, however, little is known on how these effects may
   influence higher trophic level organisms belowground. Here we explore
   whether above- and belowground invertebrate herbivores which alter plant
   community diversity and biomass, in turn affect soil nematode
   communities. We test the hypotheses that insect herbivores 1) alter soil
   nematode diversity, 2) stimulate bacterial-feeding and 3) reduce
   plant-feeding nematode abundances. In a full factorial outdoor mesocosm
   experiment we introduced grasshoppers (aboveground herbivores),
   wireworms (belowground herbivores) and a diverse soil nematode community
   to species-rich model plant communities. After two years, insect
   herbivore effects on nematode diversity and on abundance of herbivorous,
   bacterivorous, fungivorous and omni-carnivorous nematodes were evaluated
   in relation to plant community composition.
   Wireworms did not affect nematode diversity despite enhanced plant
   diversity, while grasshoppers, which did not affect plant diversity,
   reduced nematode diversity. Although grasshoppers and wireworms caused
   contrasting shifts in plant species dominance, they did not affect
   abundances of decomposer nematodes at any trophic level. Primary
   consumer nematodes were, however, strongly promoted by wireworms, while
   community root biomass was not altered by the insect herbivores.
   Overall, interaction effects of wireworms and grasshoppers on the soil
   nematodes were not observed, and we found no support for bottom-up
   control of the nematodes. However, our results show that above- and
   belowground insect herbivores may facilitate root-feeding rather than
   decomposer nematodes and that this facilitation appears to be driven by
   shifts in plant species composition. Moreover, the addition of nematodes
   strongly suppressed shoot biomass of several forb species and reduced
   grasshopper abundance. Thus, our results suggest that nematode feedback
   effects on plant community composition, due to plant and herbivore
   parasitism, may strongly depend on the presence of insect herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{The reintroduction of burning is usually viewed as critical for
   grassland restoration; but its ecological necessity is often untested.
   On the one hand, fire may be irreplaceable because it suppresses
   dominant competitors, eliminates litter, and modifies resource
   availability. On the other hand, its impacts could be mimicked by other
   disturbances such as mowing or weeding that suppress dominants but
   without the risks sometimes associated with burning. Using a 5-year
   field experiment in a degraded oak savanna, we tested the impacts of
   fire, cutting and raking, and weeding on two factors critical for
   restoration: controlling dominant invasive grasses and increasing
   subordinate native flora. We manipulated the season of treatment
   application and used sites with different soil depths because both
   factors influence fire behavior. We found no significant difference
   among the treatments-all were similarly effective at suppressing exotics
   and increasing native plant growth. This occurred because light is the
   primary limiting resource for many native species and each treatment
   increased its availability. The effectiveness of disturbance for
   restoration depended more on the timing of application and site factors
   than on the type of treatment used. Summer disturbances occurred near
   their reproductive peak of the exotics, so their mortality approached
   100\%. Positive responses by native species were significantly greater
   on shallow soils because these areas had higher native diversity prior
   to treatment. Although likely not applicable to all
   disturbance-dependent ecosystems, these results emphasize the importance
   of testing the effectiveness of alternative restoration treatments prior
   to their application.}},

   intensity. Fewer snail individuals, open-land species and open-land
   individuals were found on pastures with high than on pastures with low

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to assess spider diversity among habitats that
   are typically used for afforestation in Ireland, and to identify habitat
   parameters which could potentially be used as indicators of their
   biodiversity value. Ground-dwelling spiders were surveyed in 24 sites
   across Ireland, with eight sites of each of the following habitat types:
   improved grassland, wet grassland and peatland. The spiders were sampled
   using pitfall traps which were located within the major vegetation types
   present in each site as well as within supplementary habitat features
   which may add to biodiversity value of the whole site such as hedgerows,
   flushes and the edges of ditches and streams.
   Each habitat supported distinct spider assemblages that reflect major
   differences in both environmental conditions and management regime. The
   improved grasslands had low spider species richness and low variation in
   assemblage structure which is probably related to the intensive
   management of this habitat. In this case hedgerows maybe an important
   aspect of the spider diversity within agricultural landscapes. The
   peatlands, and to a lesser extent wet grasslands, supported a diverse
   and specialist spider fauna, including a number of rare species; this
   may be due to differences in soil moisture and plant architecture.
   Indicators of biodiversity value identified included wet flushes in the
   peatlands and low grazing pressure in the wet grasslands. This study
   suggests that in terms of biodiversity value improved grassland is the
   preferable habitat for afforestation, because of the poor baseline
   spider diversity. However, it may be unrealistic to expect land owners
   to afforest their most productive agricultural land, so the management
   and habitat indicators identified in this study may be of use for
   assessing habitat quality among the wet grassland and peatlands to allow
   sites with lower biodiversity value to be identified. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Silvopastoral systems, where stock graze between widely spaced trees,
   are a viable land use option in the British Isles. An experiment (the
   National Network Silvopastoral Experiment-NNE) was set up at 6 sites in
   the late 1980s to quantify outputs from and to study the ecological
   interactions occurring between components of the system. Studies were
   carried out on the effect of developing silvopastoral systems on certain
   invertebrate groups, including carabid beetles and spiders and on the
   number of individuals and species of birds. The common protocols adopted
   across sites enable broad conclusions on the impact of such systems on
   wildlife to be made. The presence of trees on grassland attracted
   invertebrates of epigeal groups which may have provided an enhanced food
   supply which attracted birds. Spiders responded more rapidly after
   planting of the silvopastoral systems than did carabid beetles. It was
   concluded that, even at this early stage, silvopastoral systems have an
   impact on birds: birds normally associated with woodland are being
   attracted to silvopasture along with birds normally found in open
   fields, although there are problems in the scale of evaluation in the
   assessment of impact. However, it has been shown that even relatively
   recently established silvopastoral systems can significantly enhance

Abstract = {{Sustainability of forage production in the Northeast USA is affected by
   environmental and climatic variability. Complex forage mixtures may be
   better adapted than simple mixtures to variable environments and produce
   greater dry matter (DM) yield more evenly throughout the growing season,
   thereby increasing sustainability of forage production. A grazing trial
   was set up to evaluate forage production, nutritive value, and botanical
   composition dynamics of well-adapted and commonly sown forage species.
   The forage treatments consisted of simple mixtures (two and three
   species) and complex mixtures (six and nine species). The experiment was
   mob-grazed with cow-calf (Bos taurus L.) pairs five times each year. Dry
   matter distribution during the growing season was independent of mixture
   complexity; it was, instead, influenced mainly by the weather. When
   averaged across all 3 yr, mixtures containing six species produced
   greater (P < 0.001) forage yield (9900 kg DM ha(-1)) compared with
   two-species (8700 kg DM ha(-1)) or three-species mixtures (8400 kg DM
   ha(-1)). However, forage production varied within species richness
   groups. In general, regardless of the initial botanical composition, the
   predominant species in most mixtures by the end of the experiment were
   orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea
   Schreb.), and white clover (Ttifolium repens L.). Variation in nutritive
   value among mixtures was explained mainly by variation in the
   proportions of grasses and legumes. We conclude that when it comes to
   large yields and top nutritive value, the most important consideration
   is the individual species, not the complexity of the mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports on the responses of bird assemblages to woodland
   clearance, fragmentation and habitat disturbance in central Queensland
   Australia, a region exposed to very high rates of vegetation clearance
   over the last two to three decades. Many previous studies of clearing
   impacts have considered situations where there is a very sharp
   management contrast between uncleared lands and cleared areas: in this
   situation, the contrast is more muted, because both cleared lands and
   uncleared savanna woodlands are exposed to cattle grazing, invasion by
   the exotic grass Cenchrus ciliaris and similar fire management. Bird
   species richness (at the scale of a 1-ha quadrat) was least in cleared
   areas (8.1 species), then regrowth areas (14.6 species), then uncleared
   woodlands (19.9 species). Richness at this scale was unrelated to
   woodland fragment size, connectivity or habitat condition; but declined
   significantly with increasing abundance of miners (interspecifically
   aggressive colonial honeyeaters). At whole of patch scale, richness
   increased with fragment size and decreased with abundance of miners.
   This study demonstrates complex responses of individual bird species to
   a regional management cocktail of disturbance elements. Of 71 individual
   bird species modelled for woodland fragment sites, the quadrat-level
   abundance of 40 species was significantly related to at least one
   variable representing environmental position (across a rainfall
   gradient), fragment condition, fragment size and/or connectivity. This

Abstract = {{One of the key environmental factors affecting plant species abundance,
   including that of invasive exotics, is nutrient resource availability.
   Plant functional response to nutrient availability, and what this tells
   us about plant interactions with associated species, may therefore give
   us clues about underlying processes related to plant abundance and
   invasion. Patterns of abundance of Hieracium lepidulum, a European
   herbaceous invader of subalpine New Zealand, appear to be related to
   soil fertility/nutrient availability, however, abundance may be
   influenced by other factors including disturbance. In this study we
   compare H. lepidulum and field co-occurring species for growth
   performance across artificial nutrient concentration gradients, for
   relative competitiveness and for response to disturbance, to construct a
   functional profile of the species. Hieracium lepidulum was found to be
   significantly different in its functional response to nutrient
   concentration gradients. Hieracium lepidulum had high relative growth
   rate, high yield and root plasticity in response to nutrient
   concentration dilution, relatively low absolute yield, low competitive
   yield and a positive response to clipping disturbance relative to other
   species. Based on overall functional response to nutrient concentration
   gradients, compared with other species found at the same field sites, we
   hypothesize that H. lepidulum invasion is not related to competitive
   domination. Relatively low tolerance of nutrient dilution leads us to
   predict that H. lepidulum is likely to be restricted from invading low
   fertility sites, including sites within alpine vegetation or where
   intact high biomass plant communities are found. Positive response to
   clipping disturbance and relatively high nutrient requirement, despite
   poor competitive performance, leads us to predict that H. lepidulum may
   respond to selective grazing disturbance of associated vegetation. These
   results are discussed in relation to published observations of H.
   lepidulum in New Zealand and possible tests for the hypotheses raised
   here.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{329-345}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{An hypothesis predicting which woody species selected by elephant are at
   risk of local extirpation is based on an understanding of elephant
   digestive physiology, foraging ecology, attributes of individual plants
   and populations, and historical changes in ecosystems. Elephant select
   items rich in cell solubles relative to availability for achieving
   maximum throughput per unit time on account of their large energy
   requirement, hindgut fermentation with limited cell wall digestion, high
   passage rate, and inefficient recycling of microbial protein.
   Accordingly, diet is predominantly green grass and herbs in the wet
   season, green browse in the late wet and dry seasons, and bark and roots
   following leaf fall. Increased consumption of woody material indicates
   nutritional stress. Bulls graze more than cows and impact woody plants
   more when grazing deteriorates.
   Species vulnerable to extirpation by elephant are those: whose
   attributes predispose adults to pollarding, uprooting or ringbarking;
   adults coppice poorly, hence mortality occurs; mortality is not
   compensated by regeneration and recruitment owing to the impact of
   elephant and other agents; species have a restricted distribution; and
   poor dispersal ability constrains recolonisation. Threat of their local
   extirpation has increased because of an increased probability of
   encounter with elephant attributed to artificial boundaries that have
   constrained movement, and proliferation of water points that has reduced
   spatial refuges for plants and weakened density-dependent regulation of
   elephant populations. Degradation of grasslands, wetlands and riparian
   areas has forced elephant to subsist on woody vegetation for a longer
   period of the annual cycle. A reduction in water points should increase
   local elephant density and attendant density-dependent effects of
   increased foraging distance, nutritional stress, calf and juvenile
   mortality, and predation, and reduce reproduction. Eliminating human
   predation after 4000 years in some parks has contributed to the problem.
   Mitigation of the threat of local extirpation should concentrate on
   configuration of boundaries, water provision, simulated predation,
   minimum reserve size, and not pursue non-definable notions of elephant
   carrying capacity. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Management of semi-natural open ecosystems has become a necessity for
   biodiversity conservation in Europe. However, management methods are
   most often experience-based, rather than science-based. Here, we explore
   the impact of extensive (light) grazing, which is often the only
   practical management solution to stop ecological succession towards
   forest.
   A metapopulation of the bog fritillary butterfly (Proclossiana eunomia),
   a wet meadow specialist, was monitored for 15 generations: 11 before and
   four after the introduction of cattle grazing in some habitat patches.
   We relate the observed changes in P. eunomia abundance and recruitment
   to the effect of grazing on vegetation descriptors linked to habitat
   quality for the butterfly.
   Cattle strongly decreased the abundance of the butterfly host plant,
   destroyed grass tussocks used by caterpillars for sun basking, and
   altered vegetation composition and physiognomy. Consequently, grazed
   habitat patches are less suitable for P. eunomia: recruitment rate and
   butterfly use decreased by 2/3, whereas emigration rate increased
   drastically; this is likely to alter the viability of the
   metapopulation. We therefore propose modifications to its current
   implementation to limit its negative side-effects.
   More generally, it is of prime importance that conservation biologists
   and site managers collaborate in ensuring that sound ecological
   evaluations become an integral part of the design and application of
   management plans. This implies the monitoring of crucial indicators of
   the system state and variability before the beginning of the management,
   and the maintenance of unmanaged areas as biological preserves in case
   of negative impact and as controls for statistical tests of impact. (c)

Abstract = {{Terrestrial plant community responses to herbivory depend on resource
   availability, but the separate influences of different resources are
   difficult to study because they often correlate across natural
   environmental gradients. We studied the effects of excluding ungulate
   herbivores on plant species richness and composition, as well as
   available soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), across eight grassland
   sites in Serengeti National Park (SNP), Tanzania. These sites varied
   independently in rainfall and available soil N and P. Excluding
   herbivores decreased plant species richness at all sites and by an
   average of 5.4 species across all plots. Although plant species richness
   was a unimodal function of rainfall in both grazed and ungrazed plots,
   fences caused a greater decrease in plant species richness at sites of
   intermediate rainfall compared to sites of high or low rainfall. In
   terms of the relative or proportional decreases in plant species
   richness, excluding herbivores caused the strongest relative decreases
   at lower rainfall and where exclusion of herbivores increased available
   soil P. Herbivore exclusion increased among-plot heterogeneity in
   species composition but decreased coexistence of congeneric grasses.
   Compositional similarity between grazed and ungrazed treatments
   decreased with increasing rainfall due to greater forb richness in
   exclosures and greater sedge richness outside exclosures and was not
   related to effects of excluding herbivores on soil nutrients. Our
   results show that plant resources, especially water and P, appear to
   modulate the effects of herbivores on tropical grassland plant diversity
   and composition. We show that herbivore effects on soil P may be an
   important and previously unappreciated mechanism by which herbivores
   influence plant diversity, at least in tropical grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat loss and fragmentation of natural and semi-natural habitats are
   considered as major threats to plant species richness. Recently several
   studies have pinpointed the need to analyse past landscape patterns to
   understand effects of fragmentation, as the response to landscape change
   may be slow in many organisms, plants in particular. We compared species
   richness in continuously grazed and abandoned grasslands in different
   commonplace rural landscapes in Sweden, and analysed effects of
   isolation and area in three time-steps (100 and 50 years ago and today).
   Old cadastral maps and aerial photographs were used to analyse past and
   present landscape patterns in 25 sites. Two plant diversity measures
   were investigated; total species richness and species density. During
   the last 100 years grassland area and connectivity have been reduced by
   about 90\%. Present-day habitat area was positively related to total
   species richness in both habitats. There was also a relationship to
   habitat area 50 years ago for continuously grazed grasslands. Only
   present management was related to species density: continuously grazed
   grasslands had the highest species density. There were no relationships
   between grassland connectivity, present or past, and any diversity
   measure. We conclude that landscape history is not directly important
   for present-day plant diversity patterns in ordinary landscapes,
   although past grassland management is a prerequisite for the grassland
   habitats that can be found there today. It is important that studies are
   conducted, not only in very diverse landscapes, but also in managed
   landscapes in order to assess the effects of fragmentation on species.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{190}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{71-80}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The length of time and form in which disturbances persist in systems
   depends on the intensity and frequency of disturbance and on the
   abilities of resident species to recover from such events. In grazed
   grasslands, trampling by large mammalian herbivores can periodically
   facilitate weed establishment by exposing patches of bare ground but
   whether an intense soil disturbance event results in a temporary
   increase in weed abundance or a persistent weed problem remains unclear.
   In May 2002, cattle trampling following heavy rain caused severe damage
   to nine-month old, rotationally grazed, cool-season pastures (Midwest
   USA). In September 2002, we compared the aboveground composition of
   paddocks (i.e., fenced pasture sections) that were heavily disturbed to
   those that received no damage. Relative to undisturbed paddocks, forage
   species relative cover was 17\% lower in disturbed paddocks, and weed
   species and bare ground relative cover was 61\% and 100\% higher,
   respectively. By September 2004, paddock types did not differ in all
   aboveground community components. However, the abundance and species
   richness of weed seeds in the soil seed bank averaged respectively 82\%
   and 30\% higher in disturbed paddocks between 2003 and 2004. These
   findings indicate that a spatially extensive, intense soil disturbance
   event may soon become undetectable in components of aboveground pasture
   structure but can persist as an augmented weed seed bank. Because of
   high weed seed bank longevity, disturbances to formerly disturbed
   pastures would likely result in higher weed recruitment, with more
   species represented, than in those which lack previous disturbance.
   Disturbance history may thus be a useful predictor of weed community
   composition following subsequent disturbance. Based on empirical data
   supporting this proposition, we recommend that grassland managers
   explicitly incorporate disturbance history into dynamic management
   planning and do not rely exclusively on aboveground characters to
   evaluate the invasion status or colonization potential of an area by
   undesirable plants. We emphasize that the ecological legacies of past
   soil disturbance events cannot only influence the contemporary patterns
   and processes of grasslands, but importantly, affect their compositional
   trajectories following subsequent perturbation.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Is the expansion of Hippophae rhamnoides in coastal dunes
   associated with a decline in plant species richness, and is this decline
   best described by a hump-backed relationship between species number and
   shrub cover?
   Location: Grey and yellow dunes on the East Frisian islands Spiekeroog
   and Norderney.
   Methods: Total plant species richness as well as the number of
   herbaceous and cryptogam species were determined in 2001 using plots of
   16 m(2) size. We compared shrubland plots with varying cover of
   Hippophae with neighbouring dune grassland plots without shrubs as
   reference sites. Soil samples were collected to determine the values of
   some important edaphic variables (pH, organic matter, nitrogen).
   Results: The shrubland plots with Hippophae had or tended to hive lower
   soil pH and ON ratios and higher contents of organic matter and nitrogen
   than the grassland plots. Total species richness was marginally
   significantly related to the cover of Hippophae in a hump-backed manner
   on both islands. The pattern was more pronounced for mosses and lichens
   than for herbaceous species. For all species groups on Spiekeroog and
   for he herbaceous species on Norderney, the hump-backed relationship was
   much improved when using the difference in species number between
   shrubland and grassland plot as a dependent variable. Relationships
   could be improved by including the soil parameters as co-variables.
   Species richness was highest at moderate levels of shrub expansion,
   while it was much reduced in very dense shrubland. The decrease in
   species number is caused by the decline in grassland species typical of
   the open dunes, including some rare taxa.
   Conclusions: The expansion of Hippophae rhamnoides is a serious threat
   to the plant species richness of open coastal dunes, and needs to be
   counteracted by management measures.}},

Title = {{Effects of cutting and nitrogen deposition on biodiversity in Cantabrian
   heathlands}},
Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{43-52}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Questions: Does the diversity of heathland vegetation change when
   subjected to experimental disturbances such as cutting and nitrogen
   fertilization? Do changes in the vegetation structure negatively affect
   the regeneration of the dominant species Calluna vulgaris? Is cutting an
   alternative method of conserving the diversity and maintaining the
   structure of heathlands in the Canabrian Mountains?
   Location: Calluna vulgaris heathlands on the southern slopes of the
   Cantabrian Mountain range, NW Spain.
   Methods: A total of 60 plots were treated with different combinations of
   cutting and twice the estimated atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (56
   kg-N.ha(-1).yr(-1)). The changes in the cover values of the species
   present were monitored over a five year study period. The cover values
   were used to calculate abundance and species richness.
   Results: Fertilizing, with nitro-en allows biodiversity to increase over
   time. However, the greatest biodiversity is associated with the cutting
   plus fertilization treatment, since cutting allows gaps to be opened
   that are easily colonized by pioneer annual species, white fertilization
   mainly favours an increase in the mean number of perennial herbs
   (graminoids and forbs). Increased perennial herb richness also
   corresponds to a rise in their cover values. The recovery of the
   dominant woody species in these communities, Calluna vulgaris, is not
   impeded by the increase in perennial herbs species' cover values.
   Conclusions: In the Calluna vulgaris heathlands studied, cutting plus
   fertilization allowed an increase in biodiversity over time. No
   displacement of the dominant woody species, Calluna vulgaris, is
   observed due to the presence of the perennial herbs. Cutting patches of
   heathland is recommended as a mechanism for maintaining high vegetation
   diversity, when grazing is not possible.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Question: Can the seed bank play a significant role in the restoration
   of plant communities of dry acidic dune grassland where fire has
   destroyed Ulex europaeus scrub?
   Location: Northern French Atlantic coast.
   Methods: One year after the fire, the seed bank and vegetation were
   sampled in 1 m x 1 m plots along three transects from the oldest scrub
   vegetation towards the grassland. Differences in species richness, seed
   density and contribution of ecological groups in the seed bank and
   vegetation along the transects wet e analysed.
   Results: Seed density and species richness in the seed bank decreased
   significantly from the grassland towards the centre of the scrub
   vegetation; 50\% of the seed bank consisted of cow species of the target
   plant community, such as Carex arenaria, Aira praecox, Rumex acetosella
   and Agrostis capillaris. Seeds of these species were also found in the
   deeper soil layers beneath the oldest scrub vegetation, indicating that
   they can be considered to be long-term persistent. Beneath the youngest
   scrub vegetation, seeds of rare satellite target species also occurred.
   However, no target species were established on the burned site after one
   year, resulting in a large discrepancy between seed bank and vegetation.
   Conclusions: Although the seeds present in the soil indicate that
   restoration of the acidic grassland based on the seed bank is possible,
   additional management actions such as mowing and soil disturbance may be
   necessary to restrict resprouting of Ulex and to stimulate the
   germination of seeds of target species in the deeper soil layers.}},

Abstract = {{Declines of West European farmland birds have been associated with
   intensive agricultural practices, while in Central and Eastern European
   countries grasslands still harbour a diverse and unique bird community.
   However, in these countries comparative studies on the effects of
   agricultural intensity on biodiversity are virtually missing. We
   compared bird communities of paired extensively and intensively grazed
   cattle pastures in three different regions of the Hungarian Great Plain.
   The influence of grazing intensity, landscape and regional effects were
   tested on the abundance and species richness of two ecological groups of
   bird species (grassland and non-grassland birds), as well as on the
   abundance of the three commonest grassland bird species (Skylark, Yellow
   wagtail, Corn bunting) in linear mixed models. We found significant
   effects of grazing intensity on the abundance of grassland birds, which
   were more abundant on the extensive sites, whereas no effects were found
   on non-grassland birds. This could be explained by a closer dependence
   of grassland birds on grasslands for nesting and foraging, whereas
   non-grassland birds only used grasslands opportunistically for foraging.
   Landscape effect was shown on grassland bird abundance, but not on
   non-grassland birds. The regions did affect only the species richness of
   grassland birds. At species level, the effect of management was
   significant for the three commonest grassland species, which were more
   abundant on the extensive fields in all regions. Additionally, on
   Skylark abundance landscape and regional effects were also shown. These
   findings suggest that conservation of biodiversity in agricultural
   systems requires the consideration of landscape perspective to apply the
   most adequate management.}},

Abstract = {{Before European settlement the plains bison (Bison bison bison) numbered
   in the tens of millions across most of the temperate region of North
   America. Within the span of a few decades during the mid- to late-1800s
   its numbers were reduced by hunting and other factors to a few hundred.
   The plight of the plains bison led to one of the first major movements
   in North America to save an endangered species. A few individuals and
   the American Bison Society rescued the remaining animals. Attempts to
   hybridize cattle and bison when bison numbers were low resulted in
   extensive cattle gene introgression. in bison. Today, though
   approximately 500,000 plains bison exist in North America, few are free
   of cattle gene introgression, 96\% are subject to anthropogenic
   selection for commodity production, and only 4\% are in herds managed
   primarily for conservation purposes. Small herd size, artificial
   selection, cattle-gene introgression, and other factors threaten the
   diversity and integrity of the bison genome. In addition, the bison is
   for all practical purposes ecologically extinct across its former range,
   with multiple consequences for grassland biodiversity. Urgent measures
   are needed to conserve the wild bison genome and to restore the
   ecological role of bison in grassland ecosystems. Socioeconomic trends
   in the Great Plains, combined with new information about bison
   conservation needs and new conservation initiatives by both the public
   and public sectors, have set the stage for significant progress in bison
   conservation over the next few years. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},

Abstract = {{Hedgerows are an important component of the cultural landscape and may
   have an invaluable role in maintaining biological diversity. Adjacent
   land use potentially has an important influence on the species
   composition of hedgerows. In the Mediterranean region, hedgerows are
   considered as remnants of past practices and their function may be
   linked with the prevailing agrarian systems, in turn related to societal
   change. In this paper, the characteristics of hedgerows in Central
   Spain, and their interactions with adjacent fields were studied in order
   to understand their contribution to maintaining woody plant species
   richness in the cultural landscape. The hedgerow typology of the region
   were found to respond jointly both to environmental and livestock
   farming-related variations in adjacent land uses. The variation in the
   management intensity of the landscape is reflected in the composition of
   the woody plant species of hedgerows, varying from species of open
   landscape to woodland species. Moderate degrees of grazing allow for
   higher values of woody plant richness in hedgerows compared with those
   hedgerows separating systems subjected to a higher livestock loads or to
   abandonment processes. Thus, hedgerows potentially contribute to the
   functionality of these cultural landscapes and provide a basis of
   important ecological and historical value in landscape conservation
   planning. These conclusions have important implications in the
   development of landscape conservation and protection policies. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{We investigated the impact of pastoral management on birds in
   subtropical grassy eucalypt woodland in southeastern Queensland,
   Australia, where the patterns of land management have made it possible
   to disentangle the effects of livestock grazing from those of tree
   clearing. We recorded changes in bird species composition, density, and
   relative abundance across two woodland habitat types (riparian and
   nonriparian) and two levels of clearing (wooded and nonwooded) and three
   levels of livestock grazing (low, moderate, and high) replicated over
   space (1000 km(2)) and time (2001-2002). We predicted that species that
   depend on understory vegetation would be most negatively affected by
   livestock grazing. A Bayesian generalized linear model showed that the
   level of grazing had the greatest effect when trees were present. When
   trees were absent, the impact of grazing was overshadowed by the effects
   of a lack of trees. Over 65\% of species responded to different levels
   of grazing, and the abundance of 42\% of species varied markedly with
   habitat and grazing. The most common response to grazing was high
   species relative abundance under low levels of grazing (28\% of
   species), species absence at high levels of grazing (20\%), and an
   increase in abundance with increasing grazing (18\%). Despite having
   similar bird assemblages, the effect of grazing was stronger in riparian
   habitat than in adjacent woodland habitat. Our results suggest that any
   level of commercial livestock grazing is detrimental to some woodland
   birds, particularly the understory-dependant species, as predicted.
   Nevertheless, provided trees are not cleared, a rich and abundant bird
   fauna can coexist with moderate levels of grazing. Habitats with high
   levels of grazing, on the other band, resulted in a species-poor bird
   assemblage dominated by birds that are increasing in abundance
   nationally.}},

Abstract = {{Despite many successful reintroductions of large mammalian herbivores
   throughout the world, remarkably little attention has focused on how
   these actions affect native and exotic vegetation at reintroduction
   sites. One such herbivore is tale elk (Cervus elaphus nannods), which
   was on the brink of extinction in the mid 1800s, but now has numerous
   stable populations due to intensive reintroduction efforts. Here, we
   summarize results from a 5-year exclosure experiment that explored the
   effects of tule elk on a coastal grassland in northern California. Elk
   significantly altered the species composition of this community; the
   response of annual species (dominated heavily by exotic taxa) was
   dramatically different from perennial species. Elk herbivory increased
   the abundance and aboveground biomass of native and exotic annuals,
   whereas it either had no effect on or caused significant decreases in
   perennials. Elk also decreased the cover of native shrubs, suggesting
   that these herbivores play an important role in maintaining open
   grasslands. In addition, elk significantly reduced the abundance and
   biomass of a highly invasive exotic grass, Holcus lanatus, which is a
   major problem in mesic perennial grasslands. Our results demonstrate
   that the successful reintroduction of a charismatic and long-extirpated
   mammal had extremely complex effects on the plant community, giving rise
   to both desirable and undesirable outcomes from a management
   perspective. We suspect that these kinds of opposing effects are not
   unique to tule elk and that land managers will frequently encounter them
   when dealing with reintroduced mammals.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the suitability of wood pastures as a managing tool in
   subalpine regions it is essential to know more about the influence of
   grazing on the ground vegetation. This study assessed native plant
   species selection by cattle at different stocking rates, feeding habits
   and site preferences of cattle. Based on the results, conclusions
   concerning the value of silvopastoral systems in the Alps were drawn. A
   field study on six different wood pasture areas, grazed by cattle at
   different stocking rates, was accompanied by an experiment on three
   adjoining areas of 0.51 ha each, stocked with either three, six, or nine
   heifers. Plant species were recorded in plots of 20 cm x 20 cm before
   and after grazing, and the intensity of grazing on each species was
   assessed. At low stocking rates, grasses and tall species were most
   intensely grazed, while at higher stocking rates the intake of forbs and
   small species increased. Since no relationship was found between
   nutritional value and species preference, other factors such as
   accessibility of a plant seem to be important for the feeding
   preferences of cattle. The preference for grasses at low and medium
   stocking rates suggests that an increased growth of forbs might lead to
   an increase in plant species diversity. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Questions: 1. Do different management types (i.e. hay meadow, silage
   meadow, meadow-pasture, pasture) have different impact on the size and
   composition of the seed bank of mesic grassland (Arrhenatheretalia)? 2.
   How strong is the effect of management on the seed bank in relation to
   above-ground vegetation, edaphic factors and land-use history? 3. Are
   there differences in C-S-R plant strategy types and seed longevity under
   different management regimes?
   Location: Lahn-Dill Highlands in central-western Germany.
   Methods: Above-ground vegetation and the soil seed bank of 63 plots (at
   21 sites) in mesic grasslands were studied. Differences between
   management types in quantitative seed bank traits and functional
   characteristics were tested by ANOVA. The impact of management,
   above-ground vegetation, site conditions and land-use history on seed
   bank composition were analysed by partial CCA.
   Results: Management had no significant impact on species richness and
   density of the seed bank but significantly influenced their floristic
   composition and functional characteristics. CCA revealed that even after
   adjustment for soil chemical parameters and above-ground vegetation
   management still had significant impact on seed bank composition. ANOVA
   revealed that silage meadows contained higher proportions of R-strategy
   compared to hay meadows. In contrast, in hay meadows and meadow-pastures
   proportions of S-strategy were higher than in silage meadows.
   Conclusions: The type of grassland management has little impact on
   quantitative seed bank traits. Management types with a high degree of
   disturbance lead to an increase of species following a ruderal strategy
   in the seed bank. Irrespective of management type only a limited
   proportion of characteristic grassland species is likely to re-establish
   from the seed bank after disappearance from above-ground vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Question: How do various plant functional groups and types are related
   to regeneration of limestone grasslands and to temporal changes in cover
   of trees and shrubs? Which mechanisms are responsible for changes in
   differently treated grasslands?
   Location: Southern Poland, 50 degrees 01'N, 19 degrees 50'E.
   Methods: A 12-year restoration experiment after the clearing of a
   35-yr-old secondary pine wood developed on limestone grassland, and a
   parallel observation of succession in neighbouring abandoned grassland
   were carried out. Changes in cover of species with different functional
   traits and established strategies in relation to time and cover of shrub
   layer were analysed using multiple linear regression.
   Results: Over 12 years the composition and cover of species changed in
   the studied grasslands, but significant differences still occurred
   between the old grassland and the grassland restored in former wood gaps
   and that developed in former closed wood. Despite the very close
   proximity of the old grassland, the composition of restored grasslands
   was still much determined by initial conditions. In these grasslands,
   the cover of Festuco-Brometea species was significantly lower than in
   the old grassland. In all sites, the cover of species with large leaves
   and with leaves distributed regularly along the stem, and the cover of
   CS strategists increased. With increasing shrub cover in restored
   grasslands, the cover of annuals and biennials, tall species, and R and
   CS strategists decreased.
   Conclusions: Limited availability of seeds seems the principal reason
   for the weak regeneration of xerothermic limestone grasslands. Trees and
   shrubs inhibit the developed of both early successional species and
   perennials occurring in established communities. They significantly
   hinder regeneration of grasslands and should be cut every five or six
   years.}},

Abstract = {{Managing marginal farmland with high nature value can be a strong source
   of conflict between farmers and conservationists. In the West of
   Ireland, marginal farmland is at the heart of Special Areas of
   Conservation (SACs) designation and turloughs are an example of marginal
   grazing land with the status of EU Natura 2000 Priority Habitat. A
   turlough can be thought of as the aboveground floodplain of an
   underground stream in karstified bedrock. It floods in winter but
   usually dries out in summer to allow the growth and grazing of wet
   grassland communities. Whereas most conservationists agree that summer
   grazing of turloughs is required to maintain a favourable conservation
   status, they often forget that this grazing depends on farmers'
   willingness to graze turloughs, which depends in turn on a host of
   other, mostly policy-driven, factors. Hence, conserving the turlough
   habitat (aim of Natura 2000) throws up the question of the viability of
   the farming systems in which turlough grazing is embedded (aim of
   reformed CAP). To study this conflict, an approach based on
   Q-tnethodology was applied. Semi-structured interviews of turlough
   experts (both users and non-users) as well as spokespersons of various
   interest groups and research bodies yielded a large set of statements
   relating to turlough management, farming, nature, designation, and
   broader agri-environmental policy issues. Selected statements `were
   submitted to former interviewees for rating from complete disagreement
   to complete agreement as well as to farmers of 12 different turloughs
   with SAC-status. Principal components analysis of these ratings leads to
   a typology of stakeholders according to the way they respond to the
   implementation of Natura 2000, to the changing agenda of CAP, and how
   this influences turlough management. The results show that farmers' and
   conservationists' perspectives are less opposed than expected and that
   this opposition is better described as mutual ignorance of each other's
   expertise. This calls for a better communication strategy to turn
   conflict into compromise. We suggest three pathways to do this: making
   better use of the local farmers' press, fostering users' input by the
   close collaboration with an agriculturalist and an ecologist on a
   farm-to-farm basis and a marketing approach that values agricultural
   produce from marginal land for its intrinsic qualities. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Human activities have resulted in increased nitrogen deposition and
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the biosphere, potentially causing
   significant changes in many ecological processes. In addition to these
   ongoing perturbations of the abiotic environment, human-induced losses
   of biodiversity are also of major concern and may interact in important
   ways with biogeochemical perturbations to affect ecosystem structure and
   function. We have evaluated the effects of these perturbations on plant
   biomass stoichiometric composition (C:N:P ratios) within the framework
   of the BioCON experimental setup (biodiversity, CO2, N) conducted at the
   Cedar Creek Natural History Area, Minnesota. Here we present data for
   five plant species: Solidago rigida, Achillea millefolium, Amorpha
   canescens, Lespedeza capitata, and Lupinus perennis. We found
   significantly higher C:N and C:P ratios under elevated CO2 treatments,
   but species responded idiosyncratically to the treatment. Nitrogen
   addition decreased C:N ratios, but this response was greater in the
   ambient CO2 treatments than under elevated CO2. Higher plant species
   diversity generally lowered both C:N and CY ratios. Importantly,
   increased diversity also led to a more modest increase in the C:N ratio
   with elevated CO2 levels. In addition, legumes exhibited lower C:N and
   higher CY and NY ratios than non-legumes, highlighting the effect of
   physiological characteristics defining plant functional types. These
   data suggest that atmospheric CO2 levels, N availability, and plant
   species diversity interact to affect both aboveground and belowground
   processes by altering plant elemental composition.}},

Abstract = {{At the Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch, an ungrazed grassland preserve
   in southeastern Arizona, soil seed banks were sampled in June, August,
   and October 2002 and June 2003. Wildfire had previously burned 90\% of
   the research ranch in May 2002. Seed density and species richness in
   burned native grassland (2 plots) were compared to those in burned
   exotic, grassland (2 plots). Averaged over 4 sample dates, seed
   densities were as follows: burned native grassland, 591 +/- 243.1 seeds
   center dot m(-2) and 784 +/- 334.9 seeds. m(-2); burned exotic
   grassland, 501 +/- 198.9 seeds center dot m-2 and 196 +/- 123.8 seeds

   in burned exotic grassland comprised mainly exotic grasses, whereas
   annual and perennial herbs, most of them native, dominated the seed bank
   of burned native grassland. Of the 50 species detected in soil samples,
   only 20 had a persistent seed bank, and only 1 of these was a native
   perennial bunchgrass. The preponderance of transient species means that

Abstract = {{Ranches are being converted to exurban housing developments in the
   southwestern United States, with potentially significant impacts on
   biological diversity. We surveyed butterflies on 48 plots in grasslands,
   mesquite savannas, and oak savannas in southeastern Arizona that were
   grazed by livestock, embedded in low-density housing developments, or
   both, or neither. Results suggest that livestock grazing had little
   impact on butterfly species richness or abundance, while exurban
   development had minor impacts compared to negative effects that have
   been documented elsewhere in more fully developed urban and suburban
   landscapes. However, our data indicate that conversion of ranchland to
   exurban development has not been without consequence to butterflies.
   First, relatively immobile species with multiple broods and/or
   generalized diets were positively associated with development in
   grasslands, unaffected in mesquite savannas, and often negatively
   associated with development in oak savannas. Second, while abundance and
   variety of butterflies were positively correlated with plant species
   richness and cover in undeveloped landscapes, such correlations were not
   present in exurban areas. These results suggest that increased resources
   associated with housing development, including water, shade, and nectar,
   and possible negative impacts of increased avian predation and pesticide
   use, caused relationships between butterflies and native vegetation to
   be less tightly coupled in exurban than in undeveloped landscapes. (c)

Abstract = {{The abandonment of former land-use often leads to an increasing grass
   encroachment and a related decrease in plant species richness. Extensive
   grazing can be an adequate management method, but the effects on the
   vegetation depend on the livestock species. We investigated two
   different subtypes of the Armerio-Festucetum trachyphyllae Hohenester
   1960 (Armerion elongatae Poetsch 1962) where the Armerio-Festucetum
   trachyphyllae typicum is characterised by a stronger topsoil
   acidification and a denser vegetation sward than the Festuca duvalii
   subtype. The investigation area is a dry and nutrient-poor inland sand
   ecosystem located in the Upper Rhine Valley (Germany). Therefore we
   chose local sheep breeds and donkeys as grazing animals which are
   adapted to these conditions. In four vegetation periods (2002-2005), the
   influence of sheep grazing (s), donkey grazing (d) and successive sheep
   and donkey grazing (s+d) on the floristic structure of the plant
   communities was investigated.
   For both vegetation subtypes, every treatment was replicated thrice on
   paddocks 700 m(2) in area. The vegetation was recorded by 1200 releves
   (2002-2005: s, d) and by further 429 releves (2003-2005: s+d).
   Additionally, we obtained data on species composition, nitrogen input
   and phytomass at special donkey-generated microsites.
   The factors ``year{''} and ``vegetational subtype{''} had a strong
   influence on vegetation parameters. For all investigated treatments,
   nature management goals such as an increase of herbs and a decrease of
   grasses and litter are reached. Species number, especially therophytes,
   was higher for donkey grazing than for sheep grazing. But since donkey
   grazing produced a nitrogen input of 223 kg N {*} ha(-1) at the donkeys'
   faeces accumulation sites, ungrazed areas covering 4\% of the paddock
   area, the combination of sheep and donkeys can also become an important
   management tool because with the mixed grazing regime no ungrazed areas
   occur.}},

Abstract = {{Regularly managed road verge environments, such as intersection
   reservations, i.e. non-linear grassland patches surrounded by roads and
   ramps, form potential habitats for plant and insect species dependent on
   semi-natural grasslands. The first objective was to compare the
   Lepidoptera communities of intersections to other open biotopes
   (semi-natural grasslands, abandoned fields and field verges) in order to
   determine whether this is true under the present management regime. The
   second objective was to characterise environmental factors explaining
   the possible differences between the habitat groups and the most
   important factors associated with high species richness and population
   sizes in intersections. Between 2002 and 2003, a total of 97 species and
   7250 individuals were recorded in transect counts on 17 sites on both
   intersections and control areas in SE Finland. There were more species
   and butterfly individuals in the control sites, the differences being
   due to the surrounding environment and young age of most intersection
   habitats. Old intersections with high plant species richness and natural
   vegetation exhibited the highest Lepidoptera species richness, while
   soil moisture and mowing intensity were the most important factors
   explaining Lepidoptera abundance. The spreading of a thick layer of top
   soil rich in nutrients and the use of non-native seed mixes rich in
   grasses during the construction phase should be avoided and late summer
   mowing management combined with the removal of cut material should be
   applied in intersections. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Since the beginning of the 20th century, the concepts of ecotones,
   ecoclines and edge effects have been discussed from a theoretical point
   of view. However, there have been very few experimental tests of these
   ideas, which are sometimes radically different. This study presents data
   from field experimental researches and determines the status of
   transitions between cereal fields and grazed grasslands. Five study
   sites were chosen in Southern France because they were included in
   agri-environmental schemes aimed at conserving arable weeds and dry
   grassland species. In total, 128 quadrats of 1 m(2) were sampled on
   replicated transects running through transition zones. There was no
   significant increase of species-richness but there were changes in the
   botanical composition from cereal fields to grassland. These
   experimental results confirmed the opinion of Van der Maarel, E. (1990.
   Ecotones and ecoclines are different. J. Veg. Sci. 1, 135-138) that an
   ecotone is poorer in species than the adjacent ecosystems, as only a few
   species can adapt to the typical environmental factors in this zone. The
   transition zones studied rather reflected an edge effect than a real
   ecotone following the definition of Odum, E.P. (1971. Fundamentals of
   Ecology, 3e ed. W.B. Saunders Company, Philadelphie). in our case, when
   the transition zone between the two adjacent ecosystems is managed as a
   ``constraint ecotone{''} following Vanpeene-Bruhier's, S. (1998.

Abstract = {{In this study, we report on 67 years of secondary succession in the
   temperate deciduous forest Dalby Sbderskog, southern Sweden. In 2002
   vegetation analyses were conducted in 74 systematically distributed
   plots and the results compared with similar investigations during the
   years 1935, 1969 and 1976. Additionally, a floristic survey of the
   forest was made and compared with inventories of the years 1925, 1935
   and 1970. From 1970 to 2002, overall species richness of the forest
   continued to decline, but at a lower rate than before. In 2002, for the
   first time, shade-tolerant forest species constituted the largest group.
   In the upper tree layer Fraxinus excelsior became the most important
   species, at the expense of Quercus robur and Ulmus glabra. In the herb
   layer, no changes in total or mean species richness were exhibited at
   plot scale between 1976 and 2002. In contrast to the lack of
   quantitative changes in species richness, we observed major changes in
   species composition at the plot level. In particular, the former
   dominant species Mercurialis perennis had declined markedly. After
   release from a historical regime of livestock grazing and irregular
   cuttings, the predicted steady-state community dominated by Ulmus and
   Mercurialis only prevailed for a few decades before unexpected external
   events, in this particular case Dutch elm disease and invasion by the
   slug Arion lusitanicus, initiated a successional change. We conclude
   that unexpected diseases or pests or rare climatic extremes can play a
   decisive role in forest dynamics and strongly interact with more gradual
   autogenic changes of forest structure and composition. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The determinants of plant species richness and composition of meadows
   are often mutually related, showing joint effects on plant diversity.
   Thus, the specific objective of this paper was to evaluate the relative
   importance of soil, topography, and field management explanatory
   variables on plant species richness and composition of mown meadows in
   an area of the Southern Alps. The data consisted of 159 taxa sampled
   during the summer of 2003 in 56 10 x 10 m(2) sampling plots. For each
   plot, 25 explanatory variables were recorded. The variation in species
   richness and composition was divided into the three sets of explanatory
   variables using a variation partitioning method. Species richness was
   mostly controlled both by the short-term effect of nitrogen
   fertilisation, and, as stressed by studies in other landscape contexts
   in Europe, by the long-term effect of soil phosphorus accumulation. The
   decrease of plant species number on the most fertile meadows was the
   consequence of the dominance of few competitors or ruderals, which
   prevented the establishment of small stress-tolerant species. In
   contrast to species richness, plant species composition presented an
   important pure effect of topography (altitude and slope). Species
   composition depended on several topography, soil, and field management
   factors. Thus, for both conservation and restoration of species-rich hay
   meadows, it is necessary to maintain a low level of soil P content, and
   to prevent the abandonment of parcels on steep slopes and in marginal
   areas, because these hosted the highest level of plant diversity. (c)

Abstract = {{Effects of agricultural intensification on availability of grassland
   invertebrates as food for chicks of the declining Black-tailed Godwit
   Limosu limosa were studied in The Netherlands. Invertebrates were
   sampled with photo-eclectors in wet grasslands used for intensive dairy
   farming (high fertiliser input, 2-3 cuts starting early to mid-May) and
   in a meadowbird reserve (moderate fertiliser input, one cut in
   mid-June). Invertebrates were slightly more abundant in reserve than in
   agricultural fields before the first cut of the latter. In the 4-6 weeks
   between the first cut of agricultural fields and that of reserve fields,
   invertebrates were much more abundant on reserve fields. This is the
   main period of godwit chicks' presence. Mean size of arthropods was
   similar under the two management regimes, but large Coleoptera were more
   abundant in agricultural fields early in the season. in a foraging
   experiment, captive-raised godwit chicks ingested 31\% fewer prey per
   unit time when foraging in cut agricultural grasslands than in uncut
   reserve fields, a difference large enough to compromise chick growth and
   survival. Wild broods strongly selected to stay in reserve fields,
   especially after agricultural fields had been cut, and travelled towards
   reserve fields over distances up to more than 0.5 km. Preference for
   reserve grasslands declined from early June onwards. We conclude that
   postponing mowing dates, in reserves or on farmland by means of
   agri-environment initiatives, improves feeding and survival conditions
   for godwit chicks and other insectivores feeding in the grassland sward,
   in addition to its beneficial effect on hatching success.}},

Abstract = {{The goals of this study were to identify habitats occupied by the
   Eurasian grass Bothriochloa ischaemum (King Ranch bluestem) on the
   eastern Edwards Plateau of central Texas, USA, and to measure the
   effects of this invasive species on plant diversity. A set of
   descriptive field studies were conducted to determine the relationships
   between habitat characteristics (woody cover, slope, presence of roads
   and trails, history of prescribed burning, and presence of grazing) and
   the presence and abundance of this species. Species richness and
   diversity of perennial herbaceous species were compared between plots in
   which B. ischaemum was absent and plots that it dominated. The only
   habitat in which B. ischaemum was never found was under the canopies of
   woody plants. B. ischaemum grew in plots of all inclinations (flat sites
   to steep hillsides), with little evidence of habitat preference. B.
   ischaemum was more often, although not exclusively, found in plots near
   roads, probably because roads facilitate seed dispersal. There was no
   significant relationship between either grazing or fire history and the
   distribution of this species. B. ischaemum-dominated plots had lower
   species diversity and species richness than plots in which no B.
   ischaemum was found. The results of this study confirm that B. ischaemum
   is very common on the eastern Edwards Plateau and suggest that it will
   continue to spread throughout this region and to reduce native
   herbaceous plant diversity there.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural land in Canada comprises cultivated land, hayland and
   grazing land with associated riparian areas, wetlands, woodlands, and
   natural grasslands. Although these agro-ecosysterns support many species
   of Canada's native fauna, agricultural land use is dynamic, and changes
   in agricultural practices can have important implications for
   biodiversity. We report on Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada's National
   Agri-environmental Health Analysis and Reporting Program's assessment of
   wildlife habitat on farmland in Canada. Habitat use matrices were
   developed for 493 species of birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians
   associated with farmland habitat in Canada. We derived patterns of land
   use from Statistics Canada's Census of Agriculture data and applied them
   at the soil landscape polygon scale. We developed a proportionally
   weighted Habitat Capacity index to relate habitat use and land use. A
   5\% decrease in Habitat Capacity occurred on Canada's agricultural land
   from 1981 to 2001, associated with an expansion in cropland and a
   decline in pasture. A regional pattern of small decline in Habitat
   Capacity is evident in the Prairie Provinces, where dramatic declines in
   the use of summerfallow had a positive impact on Habitat Capacity. In
   eastern Canada, greater decreases in Habitat Capacity occurred,
   associated with an increase in agricultural intensification. Policies
   and programs designed to sustain biodiversity should not be developed
   independently of socioeconomic factors or policies favouring
   agricultural intensification. We recommend a holistic approach to making
   policy decisions relevant to environmental and economic sustainability
   in the Canadian agricultural landscape.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the influence of grazing intensity and effect of landscape
   complexity on grassland specialist and generalist beetles of three
   beetle families, i.e. Carabidae, Chrysomelidae, and Curculionidae, on
   extensively and intensively grazed cattle pastures in three regions of
   the Hungarian Great Plain. In every region we investigated seven pairs
   of grazed grasslands. On each field, samples were taken along two
   95-m-long transects; one transect at the edge and the other one 50 m
   away from the edge in the grassland interior (altogether 84 transects).
   Carabids (Carabidae) were sampled using funnel traps for three 2-week
   sampling periods during spring and early summer. Leaf-beetles
   (Chrysomelidae) and weevils (Curculionidae) were surveyed by sweep
   netting in May and June 2003. Analysing the grazing intensity and
   landscape complexity effects on generalist and specialist beetles with
   linear mixed models, grazing effect was detected only on specialist
   leaf-beetle species richness with more species in the extensively grazed
   sites. Landscape complexity had contrasting effects on specialist and
   generalist species. Habitat generalists were more and negatively
   affected by increasing grassland coverage (reduced heterogeneity) than
   specialists. At species level analyses on four species out of 21,
   landscape effects were shown, which suggested that landscape composition
   might have strong effects on the species composition of the beetle
   assemblages. Our results suggest that conservation of biodiversity in
   agricultural systems (such as in managed Central European grasslands)
   requires a landscape perspective besides investigating management
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{The high elevational areas in the Himalayas of India are dominated by
   forests and alpine pastures. There are many protected areas in the
   region, including Nanda Devi Biosphere Reserve (NDBR) and Valley of
   Flowers (VOF) where natural resource management plan (NRMP) has been
   implemented for the conservation of biodiversity. This has affected the
   traditional animal husbandry system, as well as the vegetation dynamics
   of alpine pastures. An integrated approach to studying the impact of
   NRMP in the region has been applied by us. First, a survey was conducted
   regarding livestock management, data pertaining the livestock husbandry,
   the role of animal husbandry in economics of rural household, and
   socioeconomics. Second, field based study on phytosociology of some
   important alpine herbs was done to enumerate the density and species
   richness in different land mark of the region. Thereafter, satellite
   data and Geographic Information System (GIS) were used to develop a land
   cover map of the area and to note changes in the landscape over time
   after implementation of NRMP. From an economic point of view the
   implementation of such plan is a setback to the rural economy. However,
   the ecological perspective of such models is a threat to the diversity
   of alpine pastures. The invasion of bushes/thorny bushes/shrubs and
   weeds with their luxuriant growth is changing the vegetation index and
   dynamics. Consequently, the diversity of herbs in alpine pastures of the
   Himalayan Mountains is in jeopardy. Overall, the situation is leading to
   landscape change in the region. This study is helpful for generating
   useful outcomes and strategies considering the question or debate ``is
   grazing good or bad for pasture ecosystems in the Himalayas?{''}. (c)

Abstract = {{Over the last fifty years, almost half of the steppe rangeland in the
   Central Anatolian Region of Turkey (CAR) has been converted to cropland
   without an equivalent reduction in grazing animals. This shift has led
   to heavy grazing pressure on rangeland vegetation. A study was initiated
   in June 2003 using 6 multiscale Modified-Whittaker plots to determine
   differences in plant composition between areas that have not been grazed
   in 27 years with neighboring grazed plant communities. A total of 113
   plant species were identified in the study area with the ungrazed plots
   containing 32 plants more than the grazed plots. The major species were
   Astragalus acicularis, Bromus tomentellus, Festuca valesiaca, Genista
   albida, Globularia orientalis, Poa bulbosa, and Thymus spyleus ssp
   rosulans. Grazing impacts on forbs were more pronounced than for grasses
   and shrubs. Based on Jaccard's index, there was only a 37\% similarity
   of plant species between the two treatments. Our study led to four
   generalizations about the current grazing regime and long-term
   exclosures in the steppe rangeland around the study area: (1) exclosures
   will increase species richness, (2) heavy grazing may have removed some
   plant species, (3) complete protection from grazing for a prolonged
   period of time after a long history of grazing disturbance may not lead
   to an increase in desirable plant species with a concomitant improvement
   in range condition, and (4) research needs to be conducted to determine
   how these rangelands can be improved.}},

Journal = {{EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{471-494}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Questions: What was the distribution of fossil mammal taxa in the
   Miocene German Molasse Basin? Were there changes in community structure
   during the terrestrial development of the Molasse Basin? Were community
   dynamics similar in the Molasse Basin to those in the rest of Europe?
   Data: We gathered the available Miocene large mammal herbivore
   occurrences from the southern German Molasse Basin {[}museum data mainly
   from Munich (Germany), with additional data from museums in Stuttgart
   (Germany) and Vienna (Austria)]. We used public data from NOW (Neogene
   of the Old World database, http://www.heisinki.fi/scienee/now) for
   comparison and as the source of ecological data for the species.
   Methods: We combined ecological data from the NOW database with
   distributions of herbivorous mammals within the Molasse Basin. We
   plotted the occurrences of taxa on a base map, and used the associated
   body size and dietary categories to plot these data on the map. We
   investigated the differences in the structure of communities in
   different time periods. We compared different time periods and
   differences among areas. We also compared the Molasse Basin and NOW
   data.
   Conclusions: The evolution of large-mammal communities in the Molasse
   Basin occurred in two phases: build up and decline. The build-up phase
   was characterized especially by a high abundance of small-sized browsers
   and mixed feeders. The diversity was especially high during the built-up
   phase, indicating a highly differentiated wetland habitat. The decline
   phase saw a very different community structure with fewer mixed feeders
   and with larger sized mammals dominating. The difference between these
   phases was largely the consequence of regional extinctions of species
   and genera. The Molasse Basin community dynamics also differ from those
   of the rest of Europe (NOW data).}},

Abstract = {{In Australia, the Commonwealth and State governments are increasingly
   devolving natural resource management (NRM) responsibilities to regional
   bodies. This move has led to the development of regional NRM plans.
   Native vegetation and biodiversity conservation, along with soil,
   pasture and water resources, are key components of the regional NRM
   plans in Queensland's extensive rangelands. This paper outlines and
   applies a set of criteria for evaluating the native vegetation and
   biodiversity content of accredited regional NRM plans for Queensland's
   rangelands. The evaluation showed considerable variation in the
   comprehensiveness of the information and knowledge base and management
   action targets among plans, including the poor articulation of impacts
   of excessive grazing pressure on biodiversity. The NRM plans lacked
   effective integration of natural resource, native vegetation and
   biodiversity conservation targets and actions. Several regions had too
   many biodiversity targets, many of which were poorly integrated. This is
   symptomatic of a limited understanding of rangelands as ecological
   systems and the lack of an integrated planning framework. We conclude
   regional NRM planning is not a `silver bullet' for biodiversity
   conservation in the rangelands, but rather, it is the beginning of a
   long road to address complex, multi-scale problems at a regional level.}},

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that plant diversity influences N and P
   cycles. However, the effect of plant diversity on complete ecosystem N
   and P budgets has not yet been assessed. For 20 plots of artificially
   established grassland mixtures differing in plant diversity, we
   determined N and P inputs by bulk and dry deposition and N and P losses
   by mowing (and subsequent removal of the biomass) and leaching from
   April 2003 to March 2004. Total deposition of N and P was 2.3 +/- 0.1
   and 0.2 +/- 0.01 g m(-2) yr(-1), respectively. Mowing was the main N and
   P loss. The net N and P budgets were negative (-6.3 +/- 1.1 g N and -1.9
   +/- 0.2 g P m(-2) yr(-1)). For N, this included a conservative estimate
   of atmospheric N-2 fixation. Nitrogen losses as N2O were expected to be
   small at our study site (< 0.05 g m(-2) yr(-1)). Legumes increased the
   removal of N with the harvest and decreased leaching of NH4-N and
   dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) from the canopy. Reduced roughness of
   grass-containing mixtures decreased dry deposition of N and P. Total
   dissolved P and NO3-N leaching from the canopy increased in the presence
   of grasses attributable to the decreased N and P demand of
   grass-containing mixtures. Species richness did not have an effect on
   any of the studied fluxes. Our results demonstrate that the N and P
   fluxes in managed grassland are modified by the presence or absence of
   particular functional plant groups and are mainly driven by the
   management.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of different restoration measures and management variants on
   the vegetation development of newly created calcareous grasslands were
   studied in southern Germany from 1993 to 2002. In 1993, fresh
   seed-containing hay from a nature reserve with ancient calcareous
   grasslands was transferred onto ex-arable fields with and without
   topsoil removal. Nine years after start of the restoration, the standing
   crop was lower and the cover of bare soil was higher on topsoil-removal
   sites than on sites without soil removal. Topsoil removal had a positive
   effect on the proportion of target species (class Festuco-Brometea),
   because the number and cover of productive meadow species (class
   Molinio-Arrhenatheretea) were reduced. Persistence of hay-transfer
   species and the number of newly colonizing target species were highest
   on topsoil-removal sites. On plots with and without soil removal,
   species richness and the number of target species increased quickly
   after hay transfer and were always higher on hay-transfer plots than on
   plots that had not received hay in 1993. In 2002, differences induced by
   hay transfer were still much more pronounced than differences between
   management regimes. Management by mowing, however, led to higher species
   richness, a greater number of target species and a lower number of
   ruderals in comparison to no management on restoration fields without
   soil removal. A detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) indicated that
   vegetation composition of the hay-transfer plots of the restoration
   fields still differed from the vegetation of ancient grasslands in the
   nature reserve. Vegetation of an ex-arable field in the nature reserve
   (last ploughed in 1959) showed an intermediate successional stage. In
   general our results indicate that the transfer of autochthonous hay is
   an efficient method for the restoration of species-rich vegetation,
   which allows not only quick establishment but also long-term persistence
   of target species.}},

Abstract = {{Many early attempts at tallgrass prairie reconstruction failed to
   achieve the high species diversity of remnant prairies, and instead
   consist primarily of C-4 grasses. We hypothesized that frequent mowing
   of established prairie grasses could create sufficient gaps in the
   aboveground and belowground environment to allow for the establishment
   of native forbs from seed. We studied forb seedling establishment in a
   25-year-old prairie planting in northern Iowa that was dominated by
   native warm-season grasses. In winter 1999, 23 species of native forbs
   were broadcast into the recently burned sod at a rate of 350 viable
   seeds/m(2). Treatment plots were mowed weekly for either one or two
   growing seasons, and control plots were unmowed. Mowed plots had greater
   light availability than controls, especially when warm-season grasses
   began to flower. Overwinter seedling mortality was 3\% in mowed
   treatments compared to 29\% in the controls. Forbs in mowed plots had
   significantly greater root and shoot mass than those in control plots in
   the first and second growing seasons but were not significantly more
   abundant. By the fourth growing season, however, forbs were twice as
   abundant in the mowed treatments. No lasting negative impacts of
   frequent mowing on the grass population were observed. Mowing a second
   year influenced species composition but did not change total seedling
   establishment. Experimental evidence is consistent with the idea that
   mowing reduced competition for light from large established grasses,
   allowing forb seedlings the opportunity to reach sufficient size to
   establish, survive, and flower in the second and subsequent years.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory by wild ungulates influences the structure and composition of

   by high numbers of elk (Cerous elaphus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa) grassland and aspen-mixed conifer forests. At each site, we
   measured butterfly abundance, species richness, and selected
   environmental variables. Butterfly abundance and species richness
   significantly differed among dates in ponderosa pine-grassland sites and
   differed significantly for date, treatment, and date{*}treatment
   interaction in aspen-mixed conifer sites in 2001, the year of greatest
   butterfly abundance and richness. Environmental variables differed
   little between treatments in either habitat, with the exception of the
   distribution of aspen stem densities, which significantly differed among
   height classes and treatments in 2001 and 2002. Results of nonmetric,
   multidimensional scaling ordination indicated that butterfly community
   composition in late summer was best explained by non-woody biomass,
   blooming forb species richness and abundance, and aspen saplings
   excluded from elk in the aspen-mixed conifer sites. Although elk were
   only excluded for 4 y, our results indicated that, at high densities,

Abstract = {{There is increased interest in vegetation spatial pattern as an
   indicator of transition shifts following catastrophes. Much, however,
   remains unknown about the mechanisms that underlie spatial pattern
   formations. In this study, we examined how the spatial heterogeneity of
   species distributions in the grasslands of the Central Pyrenees and
   Middle Atlas Mountains is associated with plant species diversity and
   the importance of self-organizing processes in the control of pattern
   formations. In the grasslands of the Central Pyrenees and Middle Atlas,
   the spatial heterogeneity of species distributions increased along a
   habitat degradation gradient defined by an increase in bare soil. In
   Central Pyrenees grasslands, however, the increase in heterogeneity was
   associated with self-organizing bare soil formations, rather than the
   self-organizing distribution of plant species. In Middle Atlas
   grasslands, the increased heterogeneity of species spatial distributions
   was a consequence of the self-organizing capacity of the composing
   species; the increase in bare soil was randomly distributed. In the more
   heavily grazed grasslands (Middle Atlas), but not in the more lightly
   grazed and better preserved ecosystem (Central Pyrenees), plant species
   richness and diversity declined significantly with an increase in
   grazing pressure because fewer species were able to colonize empty
   space. On the contrary, the colonization of bare soil by new species
   increased the diversity and spatial organization of new colonizing
   species in Central Pyrenees grassland. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We apply an ecological perspective to the understanding of land use
   change and its implications for vegetation dynamics in the agropastoral
   zone of eastern temperate Australia. We have presented a
   state-and-transition model to describe in broadest terms the range of
   land uses that affect grassy vegetation. We predict the biological
   attributes of plant traits that are likely to be associated with
   different land uses and identify some gaps in our knowledge that are
   seen as necessary for future management of this land. These gaps
   reflect, to some extent, differences between ecological and agricultural
   disciplines in types and land uses for which data have been collected.
   In particular, the floristics and transitions involved in change of land
   use from fertilized pastures to native grassland is poorly understood.
   The plant traits associated with the more intensive land uses have not
   been described, and thus form a test for the predictions of plant trait
   changes that can be derived from other continents.
   We suggest that plant traits provide a vital link between vegetation
   change and ecosystem function, and are therefore a potentially important
   integration tool for understanding the consequences of land use change

Abstract = {{A Iona-term vegetation restoration experiment on land infested by
   Pteridium aquilinum is described. It was established in 1993 in the
   North Peak Environmentally Sensitive Area, Derbyshire, UK. The target
   was to restore Calluna moorland that existed before P. aquilinum
   invasion. The experimental design incorporated vegetation restoration
   treatments (sheep grazing and Calluna vulgaris seeding) at split-plot
   levels within P. aquilinum control treatments (herbicide and cutting in
   different combinations).
   For P. aquilinum the most successful control treatment used was cutting
   twice per year. August cover was reduced from ca. 100\% to < 10\% in
   most years from 1998. C. vulgaris seeding was most successful using C.
   vulgaris brash, with a mean density of 2.5 seedling m(-2) recorded.
   Species richness was greatest with cutting-only treatments, giving a
   species density of 7-8 m(-2) from 1998, compared to about 3 m(-2) for
   untreated plots. Grazing gave 6-7 m(-2) compared to 4-5 m(-2) for
   un-grazed plots.
   Controlling P. aquilinum was found to be a long-term commitment.
   Cutting-twice-per-year with light grazing is recommended, both for P
   aquilinum control and vegetation restoration. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Decline of grassland diversity throughout Europe within the last decades
   is threatening biological diversity and is a major conservation problem.
   There is an urgent need to determine the underlying factors that control
   vascular plant species richness and composition in managed grasslands.
   in this study, 117 grasslands were sampled using standardised methods.
   Explanatory variables were recorded for each grassland site, reflecting
   the local field management, site-specific environmental conditions and
   large-scale spatial trends. Using variation partitioning methods, we
   determined the pure and shared effects of these three sets of
   explanatory variables on the plant species richness and composition in
   grasslands. Most of the explained variation in plant species richness
   was related to the joint effect of local field management and
   environmental variables. However, the applied variation partitioning
   approach revealed that the pure effect of spatial variables contributed
   relatively little to explaining variation in both the plant species
   richness and species composition. The largest fractions of explained
   variation in plant species composition were accounted for by the pure
   effects of environmental and local field management variables. Moreover,
   the results revealed that the main mechanisms by which these sets of
   explanatory variables affect plant species vary according to the type of
   management regime under study. From our findings we could conclude that
   particularly a reduction of nitrogen fertilisation on meadows and
   grazing at a low stocking rate on pastures can help to conserve
   biodiversity. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological benefits of changing cattle grazing practices in the
   western United States remain controversial, due in part to a lack of
   experimentation. In 1997 we initiated an experimental study of two
   rangeland alternatives, cattle removal and high-impact grazing, and
   compared grassland community responses with those with more
   conventional, moderate grazing practices. The study was conducted in a
   high-elevation, semiarid grassland near Flagstaff, Arizona (U.S.A.). We
   conducted annual plant surveys of modified Whittaker plots for 8 years
   and examined plant composition shifts among treatments and years.
   High-impact grazing had strong directional effects that led to a decline
   in perennial forb cover and an increase in annual plants, particularly
   the exotic cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.). A twofold increase in plant
   cover by exotic species followed a severe drought in the sixth year of
   the study, and this increase was greatest in the high-impact grazing
   plots, where native cover declined by one-half. Cattle removal resulted
   in little increase in native plant cover and reduced plant species
   richness relative to the moderate grazing control. Our results suggest
   that some intermediate level of cattle grazing may maintain greater
   levels of native plant diversity than the alternatives of cattle removal
   or high-density, short-duration grazing practices. Furthermore, episodic
   drought interacts with cattle grazing, leading to infrequent, but
   biologically important shifts in plant communities. Our results
   demonstrate the importance of climatic variation in determining
   ecological effects of grazing practices, and we recommend improving
   conservation efforts in and rangelands by developing management plans
   that anticipate this variation.}},

Abstract = {{1. Declining populations of UK grassland flora and fauna have been
   attributed to intensification of agricultural management practices,
   including changes in cutting, fertilizer, grazing and drainage regimes.
   We aimed to develop field margin management practices that could reverse
   declines in intensively managed grassland biodiversity that would have
   application in the UK and Europe. Here we focus on one aspect of
   grassland biodiversity, the beetles.
   2. In four intensively managed livestock farms in south-west England,
   10-m wide field margins in existing grasslands were managed to create
   seven treatments of increasing sward architectural complexity. This was
   achieved through combinations of inorganic (NPK) fertilizer, cattle
   grazing, and timing and height of cutting. To examine the potential
   influence of complexity on faunal diversity, beetles were identified to
   species level from suction samples taken between 2003 and 2005, and
   their assemblage structure was related to margin management, floral
   assemblages and sward architecture.
   3. Beetle abundance, and species richness and evenness were influenced
   by margin management treatment and its interaction with year.
   Correlations with sward architecture and the percentage cover of
   dominant forbs and grasses were also found. Functional groups of the
   beetles showed different responses to the management treatments. In
   particular, higher proportional abundances of seed/flower-feeding guilds
   were found in treatments not receiving NPK fertilizer.
   4. The assemblage structure was shown to respond to margin management
   treatments, sward architecture and the percentage cover of dominant
   forbs and grasses. The most extensively managed treatments were
   characterized by distinct successional trajectories from the control
   treatment.
   5. Synthesis and applications. This study provides management options
   suitable for use within agri-environment schemes intended to improve
   faunal diversity associated with intensively managed lowland grasslands.
   Field margins receiving either no management or a single July silage cut
   were shown to support greater abundances and species richness of
   beetles, although subtler modifications of conventional management may
   also be beneficial, for example the absence of NPK fertilizer while
   maintaining grazing and silage cutting systems.}},

Title = {{Direct and indirect effects of the most widely implemented Dutch
   agri-environment schemes on breeding waders}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{70-80}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. In the Netherlands, agri-environment schemes are an important tool
   for halting the ongoing decline of meadow birds and, in particular,
   waders breeding on wet meadows. The effectiveness of the main scheme,
   postponed mowing, is heavily debated because it does not result in
   higher breeding densities. Recently, agri-environmental collectives have
   become involved in the co-ordination of scheme applications and
   additional measures have been introduced. One of them is per-clutch
   payment: farmers are paid per wader clutch without being restricted in
   their farming practices.
   2. We evaluated the effectiveness of the combination of the two
   measures, postponed mowing and per-clutch payment, by determining the
   number of birds and territories on 12.5-ha plots where both measures (on
   average 1.6 ha postponed mowing and 10.9 ha per-clutch payment) were
   being implemented. Conventionally managed grasslands served as controls.
   Additionally, on a field with postponed mowing and a paired control
   field, we measured a number of environmental factors that might
   influence wader distribution.
   3. On plots operating a combination of postponed mowing and per-clutch
   payment, more territories of all bird species were found and more
   redshanks Tringa totanus were observed. The same pattern occurred on
   fields with per-clutch payment alone. On fields with postponed mowing
   alone, we found more territories of the most abundant wader species but
   on conventional fields we observed more lapwings Vanellus vanellus.
   4. The positive effects of postponed mowing on wader territories were
   probably caused by small differences in soil moisture and groundwater
   level between the two field types, as inclusion of these factors in a
   general linear model rendered all scheme effects insignificant.
   5. Postponed mowing affected the form and amount of fertilizer applied
   to the fields as well as available nitrogen, but none of the other
   environmental factors that were measured. Additional analyses identified
   groundwater depth, penetration resistance and prey density (earthworms,
   Lumbricidae, and leatherjackets, Tipulidae larvae) as the main factors
   determining wader density.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results show that conservation
   measures consisting of postponed mowing and per-clutch payment
   implemented by agri-environment collectives do not support a higher
   abundance of waders but do support marginally higher breeding densities
   of waders compared to conventional farms. These results are probably due
   to differences in soil moisture and groundwater depth. The effectiveness
   of agri-environment schemes directed towards conservation of waders
   might be enhanced by including raised groundwater levels into scheme
   prescriptions.}},

Title = {{Enhancing diversity of species-poor grasslands: an experimental

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{81-94}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Many grasslands in north-west Europe are productive but species-poor
   communities resulting from intensive agriculture. Reducing the intensity
   of management under agri-environment schemes has often failed to
   increase botanical diversity. We investigated biotic and abiotic
   constraints on diversification by manipulating seed and microsite
   availability, soil fertility, resource competition, herbivory and
   deficiencies in the soil microbial community.
   2. The effectiveness of 13 restoration treatments was investigated over
   4 years in a randomized block experiment established in two productive
   grasslands in central-east and south-west England.
   3. Severe disturbance involving turf removal followed by seed addition
   was the most effective and reliable means of increasing grassland
   diversity. Disturbance by multiple harrowing was moderately effective
   but was enhanced by molluscicide application to reduce seedling
   herbivory and by sowing the hemiparasite Rhinanthus to reduce
   competition from grasses.
   4. Low-level disturbance by grazing or slot-seeding was ineffective in
   increasing diversity. Inoculation with soil microbial communities from
   species-rich grasslands had no effect on botanical diversity. Nitrogen
   and potassium fertilizer addition accelerated off-take of phosphorus in
   cut herbage but did not cause a reduction in soil phosphorus or increase
   botanical diversity.
   5. Different grazing management regimes had little impact on diversity.
   This may reflect the constraining effect of the July hay cut on species
   dispersal and colonization.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Three alternative approaches to grassland
   diversification, with different outcomes, are recommended. (i) High
   intervention deturfing, which would create patches with low competitive
   conditions for rapid and reliable establishment of the target community.
   For reasons of cost and practicality this can only be done over small
   areas but will form source populations for subsequent spread. (ii)
   Moderate intervention (harrowing or slot-seeding) over large areas,
   which would establish a limited number of desirable, generalist species
   that perform well in restoration. This method is low cost and rapid but
   the increases in biodiversity are less predictable. (iii) Phased
   restoration, which would complement the above approaches. Productivity
   and competition are reduced over 3-5 years using Rhinanthus or
   fertilizers to accelerate phosphorus off-take. After this time harrowing
   and seeding should allow a wide range of more specialist species to
   establish. However, further research is required to determine the
   long-term effectiveness of these approaches.}},

Title = {{The impact of high-altitude ski-runs on alpine grassland bird
   communities}},

Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{210-219}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Treeless mountainous areas at high altitudes have increased in value
   as wildlife habitat, but they are affected and increasingly threatened
   by ski-resort developments, in particular by the construction and
   enlargement of ski-pistes. To assess the extent of this threat, we
   compared bird diversity and community composition in circular plots
   centred on (i) ski-runs of recent construction, (ii) grassland habitats
   adjacent to ski-runs and (iii) natural grassland habitats far from the
   ski-runs.
   2. Plots located in natural grasslands supported the greatest bird
   species richness and diversity and the greatest grassland species
   density, whereas those set in ski-pistes presented the lowest values.
   Plots located beside ski-runs did not support smaller numbers of bird
   species and diversity than plots of natural areas, but they supported a
   significantly lower bird density. This suggests that ski-pistes, besides
   exerting a negative direct effect on the structure of local bird
   communities, may also exert an indirect, detrimental effect on bird
   density in nearby patches.
   3. Generalized linear models showed that species richness and diversity,
   and abundance of grassland species were best modelled by combinations of
   factors, including habitat type (the three categories defined above) and
   altitude. The category ski-run, in particular, was negatively correlated
   with species richness, diversity and abundance, and altitude was
   negatively associated with richness and diversity.
   4. Richness and abundance of arthropods were significantly lower in
   ski-pistes than in the other plot types. Given that many invertebrates
   were preyed upon by birds, low food availability on ski-runs may be one
   of the factors reducing the attractiveness of these patches to birds.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Retaining the avifauna around ski-resorts
   is likely to involve developing new, environmentally friendly ways of
   constructing pistes, such as only removing rocks and/or levelling the
   roughest ground surfaces, to preserve as much soil and natural
   vegetation as possible. Restoration of ski-pistes should promote the
   recovery and maintenance of local vegetation to enhance invertebrate and
   bird assemblages. In order to not compromise the safety of the ski-runs,
   it may be necessary to control encroaching shrubs through pruning and/or
   cattle grazing.}},

Title = {{Grazing effects on the species-area relationship: Variation along a
   climatic gradient in NE Spain}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-34}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Questions: Does grazing have the same effect on plant species richness
   at different spatial scales? Does the effect of spatial scale vary under
   different climatic conditions and vegetation types? Does the slope of
   the species-area curve change with grazing intensity similarly under
   different climatic conditions and vegetation types?
   Location: Pastures along a climatic gradient in northeastern Spain.
   Methods: In zones under different regimes of sheep grazing (high-,
   low-pressure, abandonment), plant species richness was measured in
   different plot sizes (from 0.01 to 100 m(2)) and the slope of the
   species-area curves was calculated. The study was replicated in five
   different locations along a climatic gradient from lowland semi-arid
   rangelands to upland moist grasslands.
   Results: Species richness tended to increase with grazing intensity at
   all spatial scales in the moist upland locations. On the contrary, in
   the most and locations, richness tended to decrease, or remain
   unchanged, with grazing due to increased bare soil. Grazing
   differentially affected the slope (z) of the species-area curve (power
   function S = c A(z)) in different climatic conditions: z tended to
   increase with grazing in arid areas and decrease in moist-upland ones.
   beta-diversity followed similar pattern as z.
   Conclusions: Results confirm that the impact of grazing on plant species
   richness are spatial-scale dependent. However, the effects on the
   species-area relationship vary under different climatic conditions. This
   offers a novel insight on the patterns behind the different effects of
   grazing on diversity in moist vs. and conditions reported in the
   literature. It is argued that the effect of spatial scale varies because
   of the different interaction between grazing and the intrinsic spatial
   structure of the vegetation. Variations in species-area curves with
   grazing along moisture gradients suggest also a different balance of
   spatial components of diversity (i.e. alpha- and beta-diversity).}},

   of interaction of each of nine small-scale disturbances affecting forest
   stands in the Black Hills. Different disturbances were partitioned

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{In the study area (Yanjiaping Village, Hebei Province, China), grazing
   extensity varies at different locations, small and discontinuous
   croplands are imbedded in some arid grassland, which are habitats for
   the melitaeine butterflies, Euphydryas aurinia and Melitaea phoebe.
   These two species of butterflies coexist in this area, in which grazing
   and cultivation are the main disturbances. Grazing and cultivation have
   a reciprocal effect on E. aurinia, rather than M. phoebe. We observed
   that E. aurinia preferred to occupy patches with moderate grazing and
   imbedded with small and discontinuous croplands, where E aurinia also
   has high population density. The percentage of E aurinia larval groups
   in the ribbings was significantly higher than that of M. phoebe, whereas
   larvae of both species tended to increase in recent years. Our data also
   showed that the population density and the patch occupancy rate of both
   E. aurinia and M. phoebe were the highest under moderate grazing. It
   indicates that cultivation of small and discontinuous croplands within
   the patch has a significant effect on the population density of both
   species of melitaeine butterflies. Thus, to artificially create or
   maintain semi-natural habitats, complemented by moderate grazing, might

Abstract = {{The barn owl Tyto alba has been in decline throughout much of its range
   largely as a consequence of loss of foraging habitat resulting from
   agricultural intensification. The recent introduction of
   agri-environment schemes in the UK has resulted in the reinstatement of
   substantial areas of rough grassland which may be of benefit to small
   mammals and their avian predators. In this study mature grasslands
   provided by agri-environmental schemes (farm woodlands, permanent
   set-aside, 2 and 6 m field margins) were compared to better understand
   which hold the greatest prey numbers and how new areas of grassland
   targeted at barn owl conservation should be created and managed. In all
   habitats apart from farm woodlands, small mammal numbers were positively
   associated with taller swards. This study suggests that areas cut every
   2 or 3 years supported more individuals and species than areas cut
   annually, although this trend was only significant for common shrews.
   With the introduction of the new Environmental Stewardship scheme in
   2005, our results suggest that the area of suitable foraging habitat for
   barn owls is likely to increase. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Tenerife pastures in the Teno plateau are under a goat grazing
   management system, and the number of goats has increased by 70\% in the
   past 10 years. This plant community was sampled during 4 years (1992,
   1993, 1994 and 1999) over a 10-year period, using ten 0.25 m(2) Plots to
   reveal changes in species composition, soil nutrient content, and
   biomass nutrient content over time and relate these variables to changes
   in management and understand aspects of the dynamics of these pastures.
   The results revealed no changes in biomass nutrient composition over the
   sampling period; however, biomass protein content was related to changes
   in species composition. Soil phosphorus content increased in the last
   sampling year and was related to an average species richness decrease in
   the plots. Results suggest that the increase in soil phosphorus and the
   decrease in species richness are related to the increase in goat grazing
   intensity. At the end of the studied period, species with a higher
   protein content increased in importance in the species composition. The
   restoration of pastures degraded by agriculture or overgrazing is
   required to provide a larger area for grazing and to ensure sustainable
   management of these protected areas. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Established parks and nature reserves may be inadequate to preserve
   long-term biotic diversity, especially in tropical regions of Latin
   America where anthropogenic disturbance and land-conversion is an
   ongoing problem. Demand for economically productive land uses, such as
   cattle pastures or monoculture plantations, is one of the greatest
   threats to habitat and wildlife preservation. As a result, conservation
   biologists have turned to examining attributes of nonprotected lands to
   determine which land uses both support wildlife and make economic sense.
   I examined bird use of a plantation of Ginelina arborea ({''}white
   teak{''} or ``melina{''} trees; hereafter ``plantation{''}) in Guatemala
   to assess its suitability as bird habitat. Gmelina arborea is grown
   mainly for wood and paper pulp. Several compositionally different
   habitats were identified, based on the amount of natural vegetation
   grown within and among the plantation trees, forming a heterogeneous
   landscape. I detected 195 bird species from 45 families within this
   plantation-dominated landscape, and 144 species in plantation habitats
   combined. I observed a positive association between increased vegetative
   complexity and bird species richness; moreover, bird species richness
   attained levels statistically indistinguishable from those found in
   nearby forest fragments. Mixed plantation habitat containing 19-31\%
   natural vegetative coverage supported bird communities that equaled or
   surpassed levels of species richness found by other researchers in
   shaded coffee (Coffea spp.) plantations. However, pure stands of G.
   arborea supported richness levels equal to those of grazed pasture;
   diversity levels associated with both these land uses were close to
   those reported for sun coffee plantations. Clearly, native vegetation
   played a significant role in enhancing bird species richness in the
   plantation habitat, and amounts of relative cover similar to or
   exceeding those in the plantation I studied should be considered in any
   management plan for G. arborea in Central America.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{103-109}},
Abstract = {{The seed bank is an important mechanism for the persistence of species
   in ephemeral wetlands, but grazing by domestic stock may change the seed
   bank and in turn the capacity of the system to recover from disturbance.
   The sediments of two areas in Thegoa Lagoon (Murray - Darling Basin),
   one area grazed by sheep when dry and the other ungrazed, were examined.
   The objective of the study was to determine whether and how the (1)
   germinable seed bank and (2) final plant communities differ between the
   grazed and ungrazed areas. The seed banks were subjected to one of the
   following three water depths: 5 cm above the surface of the water, 5 cm
   below the surface and 50 cm below the surface. The composition of the
   seed bank was determined by using the seedling-emergence technique for
   12 weeks, with seedlings removed every 2 weeks. The final plant
   communities were determined at 12 weeks without removing seedlings. The
   seed bank from the grazed area had a significantly lower seed density
   (5600 +/- 593 seedsm(-2)) and species richness (7 species) than the
   ungrazed area (37 683 +/- 4492 seeds m(-2), 16 species) (ANOVA: F-1,F-10
   = 50.16, P < 0.0001). The floristic composition of the seed bank was
   also significantly different between the areas (NPMANOVA: F-1,F-10 =
   15.44, P=0.0032). Glinus lotoides was in higher abundance in the grazed
   area and Alternanthera denticulata, Persicaria lapathifolium, Polygonum
   plebium, Typha domingensis and Centipeda cunninghamii in the ungrazed
   area. Similarly, the final communities derived from the grazed and
   ungrazed areas were significantly different from each other (NPMANOVA:
   F-1,F-10 = 15.53, P = 0.0032). Greater numbers of Centipeda cunninghamii
   were present in the community from the grazed area and Alternanthera
   denticulata and Cuscuta campestris were present in larger numbers in the
   community from the ungrazed area. Water depth also had an impact on
   germination; no germination occurred in seed banks flooded to 50 cm and
   one Typha domingensis seedling was observed in a sample flooded to 5 cm.
   These results showed that grazing reduces the density and species
   richness of the seed bank and in turn changes the plant communities
   derived from the seed bank; however, if grazing is removed pest plants
   such as Cuscuta campestris may require control. In addition, managed
   drawdown or water-level fluctuations are important in exposing wetland
   sediments and allowing for species to recruit from the seed bank.}},

Title = {{A framework to predict the effects of livestock grazing and grazing
   exclusion on conservation values in natural ecosystems in Australia}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{401-415}},
Abstract = {{Grazing by domestic livestock has greatly degraded many Australian
   ecosystems and its legacy will be longlasting in many areas. Although
   livestock are usually removed from conservation reserves because they
   are perceived to be incompatible with the conservation of natural
   ecosystems, they have been retained in several reserves in south-eastern
   Australia as a management tool to achieve conservation outcomes. These
   cases highlight the fact that no framework currently exists to address
   the question, under what circumstances ( and in what ecosystems) is
   livestock grazing - or the removal of grazing - likely to have positive,
   negative, neutral or uncertain impacts on the diversity and composition
   of native plants? This paper provides a conceptual framework to predict
   the effects of livestock grazing and grazing exclusion on the
   conservation values of native vegetation across natural ecosystems in
   Australia. It should prove equally relevant to other ecosystems around
   the world which have evolved without heavy grazing by large herbivores.
   The framework is based on disturbance- and grazing-ecology literature
   from Australia and elsewhere, and incorporates the following six main
   factors: ( 1) impacts of livestock grazing on soil and ecosystem
   processes, ( 2) historical exposure to grazing, ( 3) site productivity,
   ( 4) relative palatability of dominant species, ( 5) species-specific
   factors influencing plant recruitment and ( 6) spatial scale and
   landscape context. These factors are integrated into a decision tree to
   describe the potential impacts of livestock on native vegetation in a
   particular area. Livestock grazing is likely to have detrimental impacts
   on conservation values in many ecological contexts, especially in
   relatively intact, uninvaded ecosystems on unproductive soils. By
   contrast, it may be a useful management tool to achieve conservation
   objectives where it either ( 1) controls the biomass of existing
   potentially dominant, grazing-sensitive plants ( native or exotic), ( 2)
   prevents encroachment by undesirable, grazing-sensitive, potential
   dominants, ( 3) provides disturbance niches required by rare or
   significant plant species, ( 4) maintains fauna habitat structure or (
   5) enhances the diversity of species and vegetation structures across
   the landscape, especially when most of the landscape is ungrazed. In
   many cases, other disturbance regimes ( especially burning) may achieve
   similar outcomes; however, other disturbances will not necessarily be
   more effective than grazing per se, especially in degraded or invaded
   areas. The framework provides a coarse-level filter to inform management
   decisions and to allow the findings from individual studies to be placed
   in a larger ecological context. Although the framework is intended to
   improve decisions about conservation management, it is clear that much
   more research is needed to assess the role of grazing exclusion in
   previously grazed ecosystems, and that modi. cations to current grazing
   regimes require testing, perhaps by using adaptive management
   principles, to ensure optimal outcomes for biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing is a common management practise in semi-natural
   grasslands in Central Europe. Different types of livestock (horses,
   cattle, sheep) and grazing intensity are known to affect the richness
   and composition of plant species. However, knowledge of
   grazing-dependent effects on invertebrates is limited. We examined the
   influence of horse, cattle and sheep grazing on the richness, abundance
   and composition of land snail species in 21 calcareous nutrient-poor
   grassland areas in the northwestern Jura Mountains, Switzerland. Grazing
   by different livestock species did not affect the species richness,
   abundance and species composition of land snails. Furthermore, the
   number of open-land species and the ratio of large- to smal-sized snail
   species or individuals did not differ among the three pasture types.
   However, independent of livestock species, grazing intensity negatively
   influenced the snail fauna. Snail species richness, abundance and number
   of Red list species decreased with increasing grazing intensity. Grazing
   intensity also affected the occurrence of individual snail species
   (Truncatellina cylindrica, Cecilioides acicula, Candidula unifasciata
   and Trichia plebeia). To preserve the snail fauna in nutrient-poor
   grasslands, pastures can be stocked with horses, cattle or sheep.
   However, both maximum stocking rate (number of livestock units per
   hectare) and grazing duration (number of grazing days per year) must be
   carefully defined for the proper management of the pastures. (c) 2006

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{199-208}},
Abstract = {{Diversity, biomass, and productivity, the three key community/ecosystem
   variables, are interrelated and pose reciprocal influences on each
   other. The relationships among the three variables have been a central
   focus in ecology and formed two schools of fundamentally different
   nature with two related applications: (1) management - how biomass
   manipulation (e.g., grazing, burning) affects diversity and
   productivity, and (2) restoration - how diversity manipulation (e.g.,
   seeding, planting) affects biomass and productivity. In the past, the
   two apparently related aspects have been studied intensively but
   separately in basic research and the reciprocal effects of the three
   variables and applied aspects have not been jointly addressed. In most
   cases, optimal management often involves regulating biomass so that high
   diversity and productivity or other preferred habitat characteristics
   can be achieved and maintained, while restoration usually involves
   planting/seeding a certain number and/or combination of native species
   so that the native structure and function of the habitat can be restored
   and degraded ecosystems can recover faster. This article attempts to
   unify these two schools and discusses the significance and implications
   of the diversity-biomass-productivity relationships in practice, with
   particular emphasis on grassland ecosystems. (C) 2006 Gesellschaft fur

Title = {{Effects of local and landscape scale and cattle grazing intensity on
   Orthoptera assemblages of the Hungarian Great Plain}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{280-290}},
Abstract = {{The aims of this study were to test the influence of grazing intensity,
   effects of local and landscape parameters, and regional effects on
   orthopteran assemblages. We made our investigations on extensively and
   intensively grazed cattle pastures in three regions of the Hungarian
   Great Plain. The regions differed in landscape complexity; one region
   was situated in a structurally simple landscape with large landscape
   units, one in a structurally complex landscape with marshy patches and
   trees in the grasslands and one in a landscape with intermediate
   structural complexity. In each region we had seven pairs of differently
   managed grasslands, which differed in grazing intensity. Grasshoppers
   were recorded once in July 2003 using sweepnet catches and visual and
   acoustic observations in two 95 m tong transects at each site (84
   transects in total). Botanical surveys and measurements of other local
   factors were also made for each transect. After samplings, we digitised
   the most important land-use types using aerial photographs to produce
   landscape scale parameters within 100 and 500 m circles around every
   site. Analysing the management, regional, landscape and local effects on
   species richness with linear mixed models, we showed only strong
   significant regional differences. Linear mixed models for Orthoptera
   abundance yielded significant regional effects and marginal management
   effects. However, after including local and landscape parameters in a
   separate model a marginal local effect was found instead of a management
   effect in addition to the significant regional effect. Logistic
   regression models of 15 species also revealed the importance of local
   factors, particularly the importance of grass height, which is highly
   dependent on grazing intensity. We conclude that management intensity
   has indirect effects on Orthoptera species richness and abundance.
   Landscape scale parameters are also important, at Least for some
   species. (C) 2006 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Title = {{Multivariate analysis of the response of overgrown semi-natural
   calcareous grasslands to restorative shrub cutting}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{332-342}},
Abstract = {{Monitoring and evaluation of restoration management often suffers from
   poor sampling design and a lack of statistical rigour, seldom
   considering the spatial and temporal variability of habitat. We tested
   the effectiveness of shrub cutting on the restoration of calcareous
   grasslands, using a 4-year Before-After/Reference-Control-Impact (BARCI)
   project design with replicated patches of habitat. Departure from the
   control sites and convergence with the reference sites were analysed
   using the Principal Response Curves (PRC) method.
   The structure of communities was compared 1 year before and 3 years
   after management on control scrubland, restored ex-arable land, restored
   and reference grassland. Results show that shrub cutting did not suffice
   to restore the community composition of the semi-natural calcareous
   grasslands. The restored ex-arable areas maintained a community
   structure extremely similar to the control scrubland.
   The restored grassland, on the other hand, deviated from the control and
   slightly converged to the reference grassland, though not significantly.
   The dominant scrub species that was cut, Prunus spinosa, showed higher
   cover values compared to the reference grassland in any of the
   treatments, even the first year after cutting. Species typical of xeric
   and/or calcareous grassland were more abundant in the reference than in
   the restored grassland, white arable and ruderal species were more
   frequent in the restored sites.
   This study has demonstrated that the BARCI approach is a powerful tool
   for the evaluation of restoration management, as it was possible to
   evaluate not only departure from the unmanaged control, but also
   convergence with the reference community. The PRC method provided a
   comprehensive overview of the response of the 153 species involved in
   the study.
   Our results also indicate that the second PRC should be considered, when
   significant, to not exclude important information from the assessment.

Title = {{Cattle grazing, raptor abundance and small mammal communities in
   Mediterranean grasslands}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{565-575}},
Abstract = {{Abundance and diversity of small mammals are usually affected strongly
   by grazing either due to decreased food availability or quality,
   decreased suitability of soil for building burrow systems due to
   trampling and/or due to increased predation risk in the structurally
   simpler grazed areas. We estimated the effects of grazing-induced
   changes in vegetation and soil and of increased predation on small
   mammals in a Mediterranean grassland landscape. We measured vegetation
   structure, soil compaction and small mammal abundance and species
   composition in 22 plots of 8 Sherman live traps each, arranged according
   to an unbalanced two-way ANOVA design with two grazing levels (grazed
   areas and cattle exclosures) and two predator abundance levels
   (increased densities of Eurasian kestrets Falco tinnunculus by means of
   nest boxes and control). Plots were sampled during 2 consecutive years
   in early summer and earty fall. Exclosure from cattle increased
   significantly vegetation height and volume and decreased soil
   compaction. Grazing-induced changes in vegetation height and volume and
   in soil compaction produced strong effects on small mammal abundance and
   species richness. Increased kestrel. densities did not have significant
   additive or interactive effects, with the effects of grazing-induced
   vegetation and soil gradients on abundance or richness of small mammals.
   Our results suggest that the effects of grazing on small mammal
   communities in Mediterranean montane grasslands were mainly due to
   reduced food availability and by negative effects of trampling on the
   suitability of soils for building burrow systems. Decreased food quality
   and increased predation in grazed areas seemed to play a minor rote, if
   any. Reductions in stock densities would then favor generalist predator
   populations in Mediterranean grasslands through the expected positive
   effects of such reductions on the availability of food and burrows for
   small mammals. (C) 2006 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Since the middle of the last century agricultural intensification within
   Europe has led to a drastic decline in the extent of botanically diverse
   grasslands. Whilst measures to enhance the diversity of
   agriculturally-improved grasslands are in place, success has often been
   limited. One of the primary factors limiting success is the paucity of
   sources of propagules of desirable species in the surrounding landscape.
   The restoration of two contrasting grassland types lowland hay meadow
   and chalk grassland) was examined using a replicated block experiment to
   assess the effectiveness of two methods of seed application (hay
   strewing and brush harvesting) and two methods of pre-treatment
   disturbance (power harrowing and turf stripping). The resulting changes
   in botanical composition were monitored for 4 years. Seed addition by
   both methods resulted in significant temporal trends in plant species
   composition and increases in plant species richness, which were further
   enhanced by disturbance. Power harrowing increased the effectiveness of
   the seed addition treatments at the lowland hay meadow site. At the
   chalk grassland site a more severe disturbance created by turf stripping
   was used and shown to be preferable. Whilst both hay strewing and brush
   harvesting increased plant species richness, hay strewing was more
   effective at creating a sward similar to that of the donor site. Soil
   disturbance and seed application rate at the recipient site and timing
   of the hay cut at the donor site are all factors to be considered prior
   to the commencement of restoration management. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Simulation of forage management strategies considering farm-level land

Abstract = {{Land diversity is a characteristic of low-input farming systems. Land
   diversity can refer to between-field diversity of grassland vegetation
   types that are a result of management practices (fertilisation, grazing,
   cutting), and environmental factors (altitude, aspect, soil water
   capacity) that have an influence on herbage production. Land diversity
   can also concern other characteristics of the field, like its distance
   to the cowshed or its suitability for mechanization for hay-making that
   are key characteristics affecting the spatial organization of management
   practices. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, using a simulation
   model, the consequences for yield of taking the land diversity at farm
   level into account in the decision-making process. We made the
   assumption that it could be an asset rather than a constraint for the
   management of the forage system, and that it could lead to an
   improvement in the forage balance in dairy farming systems. The model is
   able to simulate the decision-making process in managing this diversity
   during a growing season. The decision process was translated into three
   management strategies of the forage system representing increasing
   consideration of the farmland diversity. We then simulated these three
   strategies for two weather series and two farmland diversity levels. We
   noticed that the strategy giving the most consideration to the farmland
   diversity improves the forage self-sufficiency (due to higher yields and
   quality of forage supplies, and a decrease in the amount of hay fed
   during the grazing period). We thus concluded that the management of
   between-field diversity could be an asset for extensive farming systems.
   In the context of extensification of agriculture and increasing concern
   about its environmental impact on biodiversity, this approach must be
   pursued. The oriented-object structure of the model will facilitate
   improvements. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock production is the primary source of livelihood and income in
   most of the high steppe and alpine regions of the Indian Trans-Himalaya.
   In some areas, especially those established or proposed for biodiversity
   conservation, recent increases in populations of domestic livestock,
   primarily sheep and goats, have raised concern about domestic animals
   competitively excluding wild herbivores from the rangelands. We
   evaluated the influence of domestic sheep and goat grazing on the
   habitat use and time budget of the endangered Tibetan argali Ovis ammon
   hodgsoni in the proposed Gya-Miru Wildlife Sanctuary, Ladakh, India. We
   asked if the domestic sheep and goat grazing and collateral human
   activities relegate the argali to sub-optimal habitats, and alter their
   foraging time budgets. Data were collected on habitat use and time
   budget of a population of c. 50 argalis before and after c. 2,000 sheep
   and goats moved onto their winter pasture in the Tsabra catchment of the
   aforementioned reserve. Following the introduction of domestic sheep and
   goats, argalis continued to use the same catchment but shifted to
   steeper habitats, closer to cliffs, with lower vegetation cover, thus
   abandoning previously used plant communities with denser cover. Argalis'
   active time spent foraging also decreased by 10\% in response to the
   presence of livestock. These results suggest a clear disturbance effect
   of livestock on argalis, and indicate a potential for competition,
   conceivably a significant disadvantage for argalis in winter when forage
   availability is minimal.}},

   65\% higher in plots with the endophyte at the one grassland site where

   oceanic alpine ecosystem of low productivity}},
Journal = {{ECOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{178-187}},
Abstract = {{Large herbivores directly affect plant communities in alpine ecosystems.
   In addition, they may compete with, or facilitate foraging by, small
   herbivores and also cause strong indirect effects on plants. We used an
   exclosure experiment to examine short-term (5-y) effects of cessation of
   sheep grazing on rodent grazing and plant communities in an oceanic
   alpine environment of low productivity with a long history of heavy
   sheep gazing. Exclusion of sheep significantly impacted plant
   communities. Vascular plant height increased, but Deschampsia flexuosa
   was the only vascular plant species that increased in sheep exclosures.
   Changes in the frequency of graminoids, herbs, and dwarf shrubs in
   exclosed plots were not related to cessation of grazing, but 6 bryophyte
   species significantly increased or decreased in response to exclusion of
   sheep. The absence of large grazers thus brought about a change in the
   species composition in favour of successional bryophytes and the
   preferred fodder plant. Neither vascular plant nor bryophyte species
   richness, nor the total cover of bryophytes and lichens, were affected.
   Cessation of sheep grazing reduced the level of rodent grazing. Rodent
   grazing correlated with changes in plant communities that led to reduced
   height and cover of vascular plants, reduced cryptogam cover, and
   reduced frequencies of 3 bryophyte species. A strong correlation between
   sheep fodder value index and rodent grazing indirectly indicated
   additive herbivory. In addition, some of the rodent effects were
   compensatory; e.g., Nardus stricta, which is not grazed by sheep, was
   significantly reduced by rodents. Our study points to a more central
   role of facilitation in structuring herbivore assemblages in the short
   term, with direct implications for the joint effects of large and small
   herbivores on the cover and frequency of graminoids and bryophytes.}},

Abstract = {{The landscapes of Inner Mongolia are widely known for the vast Stipa
   krylovii steppes. However, overgrazing and other improper land uses have
   extensively degraded the Stipa krylovii steppe ecosystem in recent
   decades. Knowledge about the soil seed banks and the remaining
   vegetation in these damaged ecosystems is crucial for guiding the
   restoration efforts. Using a germination method, this study examined the
   size, composition, and species richness of the soil seed banks in three
   field types: overgrazed steppe, enclosed steppe and abandoned crop
   field. The abandoned crop field had the largest soil seed bank with
   mostly annual and weedy plant species. Seeds of desirable perennial
   grass species were impoverished by the intensive cultivation in the
   abandoned crop field. The lack of desirable perennial species in the
   abandoned field was a critical limiting factor for restoration. Grazing
   decreased the size of the seed bank in the overgrazed steppe. But seeds
   of desirable grassland species were present in both the overgrazed and
   the enclosed steppes. As indicated by the Sorenson's indices of
   community similarity (50-67\%), plant species abundance and composition
   in the soil seed banks were closely related to the corresponding
   vegetation for each of the three sites. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Species abundance, species richness, and ground cover were measured over
   10 years on nine paired grazed and exclosure plots in short-tussock
   grassland in the early stages of invasion by Hieracium species. With and

   H. lepidulum increased locally. In contrast, 50\% of all other common
   species and species groups, and total, native, and exotic species
   richness declined significantly. Exclusion increased or had no effect on
   rates of increase in Hieracium species and rates of decline in short
   tussocks, and did not reduce rates of decline in other species.
   Exclusion had no effect on decline in native species richness, but
   mainly accelerated declines in total and exotic richness. Declines in 13
   key vegetation variables were significantly predicted by increase in
   Hieracium abundance, suggesting competitive exclusion. With or without
   grazing, Hieracium species will become more dominant and other species

Abstract = {{The South Brazilian grasslands occupy some 13.7 million ha and support
   very high levels of biodiversity. This paper reviews the current state
   of ecological knowledge on South Brazilian Campos and of threats and
   challenges associated with their conservation. The principal factors
   shaping grassland physiognomy and diversity are discussed, and
   information is presented on diversity of plant species; best estimates
   suggest that 3000-4000 phanerophytes occur in the South Brazilian
   grasslands. It is argued that, despite their high species richness,
   Campos vegetation is not adequately protected under current conservation
   policies. In the past three decades, approximately 25\% of the grassland
   area has been lost due to land use changes, and this trend continues.
   However, representation of Campos grasslands in conservation units is
   extremely low (less than 0.5\%), and the management in most of these is
   inadequate to preserve the grasslands, as grazing and fire are important
   factors for their persistence. In conclusion, the following urgent needs
   are identified: (1) to create more conservation units in different
   regions, including different grassland types throughout southern Brazil,
   (2) to develop proper management strategies where grasslands are subject
   to shrub encroachment and forest expansion, (3) to conduct research on
   biodiversity and ecological processes in the Campos region and (4) to
   raise public awareness of the value and vulnerability of this vegetation

Title = {{Monitoring changes in pastoral rangelands - the Western Australian
   Rangeland Monitoring System (WARMS)}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2007}},
Volume = {{29}},

Pages = {{191-205}},
Abstract = {{The Western Australian Rangeland Monitoring System (WARMS) consists of a
   set of similar to 1620 permanent sites distributed across the pastoral
   rangelands of Western Australia used for commercial livestock grazing.
   The system is designed to provide information to government and the
   general community on changes in Western Australia's rangelands, rather
   than to individual landholders. It is designed to report at the regional
   or vegetation type level by selectively sampling representative areas of
   the rangelands, with representation occurring at several levels. The
   system was fully implemented by 1999 and all sites, except a small
   number of ongoing replacements, have now been re-assessed at least once.
   Two site types are used. In grassland areas, the frequency of all
   perennial species is assessed, and an estimate made of crown cover of
   woody perennials. In shrubland areas, a direct census technique is used,
   with the demography and maximum canopy dimensions of all shrubs
   recorded. Changes in soil surface condition and patch distribution are
   also assessed using standard Landscape Function Analysis (LFA)
   techniques. The vegetation and soil surface information is used to
   indicate rangeland change. The system is not fixed within any single
   model of range dynamics and the outputs of WARMS can be interpreted in
   various ways, depending on the specific requirements of the end-user.
   The paper includes discussion of the institutional requirements for
   WARMS, the site stratification and selection criteria, description of
   the field methods used and the rationale behind its design. It also
   considers the implications of the site strati. cation and selection
   criteria in terms of the caveats that need to accompany reporting.}},

Abstract = {{The isopteran diversity was studied in three pastures from the northeast
   of the province Corrientes under intensive grazing management (grazing
   paddocks). A protocol for the rapid assessment of termite diversity was
   used, consisting of transect sampling. In each transect, the percentage
   of sections where termites were detected varied between 75 and 90\%. A
   total of 74 termite samples was collected, all belonging to the family
   Termitidae (subfamilies Nasutitermitinae, Termitinae, and
   Apicotermitinae). The species most frequently collected were Cornitermes
   cumulans and Anoplotermes sp. 1. Only two species (Neocapritermes opacus
   and Grigiotermes sp. 1) were common to the three sites. The species
   richness was similar between two of the habitats, with seven species
   present, while the value was five species in the third pasture. The
   microhabitats most frequently colonized by termites were epigeal nests,
   soil between plant roots and surface soil. The soil- feeding termites
   (70\%) dominated the termite assemblage, represented mainly by the
   subfamily Apicotermitinae. There was no notable influence of the
   perturbations caused by grazing activity or the type of management on
   the termite fauna of the analyzed sites.}},

Abstract = {{Ungulate populations are managed in shrubsteppe ecosystems around the
   world, but relatively few long-term datasets are available that test the
   impacts of these grazers on shrubsteppe structure and function. This
   study evaluated 8 exclosures in 4 shrubsteppe communities to determine
   the effects of deer and elk over 35 or 55 years on (1) plant biomass and
   species composition, (2) soil nitrogen (N) mineralization and net
   nitrification rates, Olsen extractable phosphor-us (P), and C:N ratios,
   and (3) arthropod diversity and abundance. The site with deer, the
   highest ungulate densities, and coldest climate (Sinlahekin Wildlife
   Area, WA) had greater vegetative biomass and cover inside the exclosores
   than outside. The sites with elk, moderate ungulate densities, and
   intermediate climatic conditions (Oak Creek and Wenas Wildlife Areas,
   WA) bad no effects of exclosures on vegetative biomass or cover. The
   site with elk, the lowest ungulate densities, and driest climatic
   conditions (L.T Murray Wildlife Area, WA) had greater shrub cover
   outside of the exclosures. Ungulates significantly increased net N
   mineralization and nitrification rates, providing a potential
   explanation for compensatory growth by grazed plants. Our data suggest
   that arthropod herbivory does not substitute for ungulate herbivory. To
   the contrary, arthropod diversity reflected ungulate-induced changes in
   plant biomass. In addition to effects on standing biomass, ungulates
   were associated with increased exotic plant species richness at all 4
   sites. Our results suggest that there may be a balance between indirect
   positive and direct negative effects of herbivory on plants that varies
   with ungulate densities and site characteristics, and that arthropod
   herbivory does not functionally replace ungulate herbivory.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of traditional forest management practices (i.e.
   forest exploitation activities such as burning, cutting and livestock
   grazing) on carabid beetle (Coleoptera, Carabidae) assemblages in
   Pyrenean oak forests of NW Spain. A total of 11 370 carabid individuals
   representing 61 species were collected by pitfall trapping from May to
   October 2004 in four types of traditionally managed oak ecosystems:
   ``dehesa{''}, ``mature open{''}, ``mature closed{''} and ``young{''}.
   These four management types experienced a variety of anthropogenic
   activities, resulting in differences in the structure and composition of
   the tree and understorey vegetation layers. We showed that the four
   management types were quite similar at the carabid assemblage level,
   mainly supporting open habitat and generalist species. The ``dehesa{''}
   system was most distinct with a higher species richness (not
   significantly) and with several unique species, probably travelling from
   the adjacent grassland. However, many species responded significantly to
   the type of management, depending on the habitat associations of the
   species. We also found strong responses of some of the species to one
   type of management, either positive (exclusively collected from one
   management type) or negatively (completely absent). Shrub cover and soil
   organic matter content were the main environmental variables determining
   the carabid assemblage structure. At the regional scale, the four
   management types accounted for a high carabid beetle diversity. This
   diversity appears to be threatened by landscape homogenization, since
   traditional management practices are disappearing due to recent land-use
   changes in the area. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{565-597}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Inselbergs are rock outcrops forming ``xeric islands{''} in the rain
   forest. Plants on inselbergs endure very harsh edaphic and microclimatic
   conditions. Monocotyledonous mats develop on the rock surface, and
   grasslands are present on the shallow soils. The inselberg-rain forest
   ecocline is characterized by the spatial transition from an herbaceous
   fringe to a shrubby fringe, a forest fringe and a saxicolous forest. We
   describe here the plant communities of the inselberg grasslands and
   herbaceous fringes of 24 sites in Southern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea
   and Gabon. The plant communities defined from the classification of 177
   phytosociological releves are compared to the existing phytosociological
   literature and the correlation between the floristic data and the
   environmental and spatial variables is analyzed. We define a new
   phytosociological order: the Sclerio melanotrichae-Habenarietalia
   procerac, two new alliances and four new associations. Herbaceous
   fringes and grasslands differ both in their flora and in their life form
   spectra, but the main differentiating factor in the floristic data set
   is the geographical location of the releves rather than the plant
   formation. Three ecogeographical groups of inselbergs are identified.
   Weeds are an important component of the inselberg flora. They are well
   adapted to the harsh inselberg habitat by their ability to cope with
   unpredictable environmental fluctuations (e.g. drought). Grazing and
   trampling by wild herds of buffaloes contribute to create suitable
   habitats for these species.
   Epiphytes are present in the herbaceous fringes. This is explained by
   the similarity of the environmental conditions on the rock and on the
   inselberg rain forest ecocline with the environmental conditions
   encountered by epiphytes in the upper part of the forest canopy.
   The inselberg grasslands and herbaceous fringes contribute to the
   regional biodiversity in three ways:
   a) fourteen species are restricted to the inselberg habitat and to the
   Guineo-Congolian region,
   b) fourteen species are only present on the inselbergs in the rain
   forest zone, their main distribution being in the savannah or at higher
   altitudes,
   c) the inselberg grassland and herbaceous fringe plant communities do
   not exist outside the inselberg habitat.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the roles played by area enclosures and fallow
   age in the restoration of plant species richness and soil seed bank
   species richness in degraded mountain rangelands in northern Ethiopia.
   Management types (enclosures versus grazed) influenced woody and
   herbaceous species richness, while fallow age showed no effect on the
   woody species. Management, age and the doubling of fallow age influenced
   the herbaceous species richness and species diversity. Management showed
   no effect on soil seed bank species richness. Fallow age and the
   doubling of fallow time also showed no influence on the soil seed bank
   of grass species, but they were influential on the forbs species soil
   seed bank. The trends for restoration of plant species richness and
   diversity and grass seed bank in response to fallow age were
   positive-linear, but they declined when the fallow ages were doubled.
   The exception was the forbs seed bank showed linear trends when age of
   restoration was doubled. The data suggest that the restoration of
   degraded rangelands in the high mountain zones of northern Ethiopia was
   still in the weedy succession stages. Long-term monitoring will be
   required to gain an informed understanding of the roles played by area
   enclosures and fallow age in the restoration of plant biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Bogs (locally named ``bofedales{''}) constitute a key habitat for
   conserving birds associated with the wet meadows and ponds on the huge
   expanses of dry bunch-grass steppes ({''}puna{''}) of the Andes. Despite
   this, the factors shaping bird numbers and species richness in this
   habitat have not been studied. This paper examines the bird communities
   in a set of bogs distributed in two Peruvian localities during the wet
   (February) and dry (September) season. It evaluates the effects of bog
   size and some habitat features (grazing intensity, presence of small
   watercourses, vegetation cover, etc.) on abundance and species richness
   of bird communities.
   Location: Two Peruvian localities above 4,000 in (humid mountains near
   Cusco, and and uplands near Arequipa).
   Methods: Given that bogs tended to be long and narrow (mean width: 59
   in, range 10 - 200 in), birds were counted along three parallel,
   simultaneous transects covering the full area of bogs. Independent
   variables evaluated were the size (ha), altitude (in above sea level),
   slope (0-90 degrees), presence/absence of small permanent watercourses
   and cover (\%) of water, meadows and cushion-like Yareta shrubs in each
   study bog. Grazing intensity was estimated by counting the number of
   faecal pellet groups (of alpacas and other livestock) inside a
   one-metre-wide band transect.
   Results: Results support the view that bogs operate as local
   ``hotspots{''} for birds, as they maintain species associated with
   different habitats, such as rivers and lakes (Anas flavirostris, Anas
   specularoides. etc). wet meadows (Vanellus resplendens, Chloephaga
   melanoptera, Cinclodes fuscus, Lessonia oreas, etc.) or bunch-grass
   steppes (Metriopelia aymara, Thinocorus orbignyianus, etc.). Bird
   species richness and numbers were positively correlated with bog size
   and, after controlling for this effect, species richness increased in
   those and upland bogs crossed by small watercourses during the dry
   period. This supports the key role of water availability on the bird
   communities of these steppes. No effect of grazing intensity and other
   habitat features were recorded.
   Conclusions: From a conservation perspective, bog size and the presence
   of permanent watercourses seem to be two focal criteria for prioritizing
   relevant bogs for protection and can also be used as key guidelines for
   evaluating the pervasive effects of the reduction and alteration of bogs
   by public works (roads), agricultural encroachment or draining.}},

Abstract = {{An area of dry grassland in New Zealand, comprising an equal mixture of
   native and exotic species, was subject to perturbations of irrigation,
   fertilization and cessation of grazing. The vegetation response was
   recorded for 3 years. Total cover, and the contribution of native
   species to that cover, fluctuated between years even in the control
   plots. Irrigation increased total cover, but decreased the cover of
   native species. Fertilization produced the same effects, only less
   strongly, and also reduced species richness, the loss being in native
   species. In spite of overall effects of treatments on native and exotic
   cover, when individual species' responses to irrigation, fertilization
   or exclosure were calculated, there was no significant difference
   between the native and exotic plant guilds. Species differed in their
   responses, but the native and exotic guilds overlapped. When grouped by
   morphology, the only significant difference between the responses to
   perturbation was that forbs and graminoids responded more positively to
   irrigation than woody and cryptogamic species. The realized responses of
   the species to the perturbations described here showed little
   correlation with their physiological responses as determined in previous
   greenhouse experiments. It is suggested that the realized responses are
   strongly, and currently unpredictably, influenced by competition from
   the other species present. Soil nutrients and soil water were both
   important controls on the community. The relative similarity in the
   nature of the response to these two factors - nutrients and water -
   suggests that they affect species in similar ways, possibly because the
   greater growth rate of the exotic species mediates the short-term
   response to both. Grazing has less effect on the current community than
   either nutrients or water, although it may have been historically
   important in shaping the species pool. From the poor predictability of
   field responses from morphological guilds or from ecophysiological
   responses, it is suggested that the `functional types' approach,
   although conceptually attractive, lacks experimental support in these
   grasslands. It is concluded that the exotic species have invaded by
   being pre-adapted to the environment with the same environmental
   responses as the natives, but with the advantage of generally higher
   growth rates.}},

Abstract = {{Turloughs are karst wetland ecosystems that are virtually unique to
   Ireland. Flooding annually in autumn through springs and fissures in the
   underlying limestone and draining in the springtime, often through the
   same fissures or swallow-holes, they have been described as `temporal
   ecotones'. Over 300 have been documented. They are priority habitats in
   the EU Habitats Directive and support a variety of wet grassland and fen
   type vegetation. Though the vegetation has been recorded and mapped for
   over 80 turloughs, records for invertebrates are more sporadic.
   Characteristic species include some aquatic species-often benefiting
   from the absence of fish-, and many wetland terrestrial species,
   including carabid beetles that are rare on a European scale. Due to
   their shallow nature and the full vegetation cover of the basin,
   turloughs can host internationally significant numbers of visiting
   winter wildfowl, particularly whooper swans. The variety of plant and
   invertebrate communities between turloughs is primarily due to different
   hydrogeomorphological characteristics, but also depends on the range of
   grazing practices on turloughs. Since these often vary within a turlough
   basin, this helps maintain within-turlough biodiversity. The main threat
   to turloughs in the past was drainage, but pollution by nutrients is
   also now potentially detrimental. However, a more recent and important
   threat may be the cessation of farming within turloughs. As potentially
   threatened wetlands of European importance, turloughs require a full
   inventory of their biodiversity and the factors affecting it. The
   collation here of all literature concerning turloughs will provide a
   basis for an integrated approach to future research on turloughs that is
   essential for a full understanding of these complex ecosystems. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{When semi-natural pastures are abandoned, specialized grassland species
   are lost as a consequence of succession. As a counter-measure,
   previously abandoned grasslands may be restored by clearing shrubs and
   trees and re-introducing grazing livestock. In order to examine the
   effects of this type of habitat restoration, we compared species
   richness of plants and of specialized plants thought to be dependent on
   continuous management and species richness and abundance of butterflies
   and red-listed butterflies in 12 sets of matched continuously managed,
   abandoned and restored grassland in southern Sweden. We found no
   differences in species richness or abundance between the three grassland
   types. There were, however, some negative effects of abandonment. The
   number of management-dependent plants decreased with increasing cover of
   trees and shrubs, and in restored sites species richness of all groups
   decreased with increasing cover of trees and shrubs before restoration.
   Also the present management significantly affected both butterflies and
   plants. Species richness of both groups increased with increasing
   vegetation height and differed between sites depending on the species of
   grazers, with negative effects of sheep compared to cattle or horses.
   Our study indicates that for grassland management to be efficient, the
   restoration actions should mainly be directed towards sites where the
   post-abandonment succession has not proceeded too far. (c) 2006 Elsevier

Abstract = {{An increasing number of invasive species are changing ecosystems around
   the world. Road verges have commonly become the first footholds of
   non-native species in the new environments. Regularly mown road verges
   also offer habitats for meadow flora and fauna, which in Europe have
   suffered from the radical decline of semi-natural biotopes due to the
   agricultural modernization. We studied impacts of an invasive plant
   Lupinus polyphyllus on the plant and Lepidoptera species composition
   along road verges. The plant species composition was studied on 15 sites
   (with 1 m(2) quadrats) and butterflies and diurnal moths along 15
   transects (with weekly censuses) in SE Finland, each site and transect
   representing equally lupine invaded verge and an adjacent non-lupine
   verge. The species richness and diversity of flora and the cover and
   species richness of low growing (< 20 cm) species, in particular, was
   lower in lupine verges compared to non-lupine verges. Also, the
   abundance of butterflies was lower in lupine verges. As the lupine cover
   approached 100\%, fewer butterflies were observed in lupine transects
   compared to the adjacent non-lupine transects and a higher proportion of
   individuals were flying. our results suggest that the changes in plant
   species assemblages and lower plant species richness in lupine invaded
   areas had ``bottom-up{''} effects on higher trophic levels. Further
   studies on the control of lupine are urgently needed, but meanwhile we
   suggest regular mowing before the lupines have shed their seeds,
   together with the removal of the cuttings, to be the best management
   option. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   consists of four treatments of decreasing land use intensity, applied in
   the context of management intensive grazing. Treatments include: (1)
   clipping and harrowing following each grazing rotation (intensive); (2)
   clipping only once following the first defoliation; (3) grazing every
   second rotation; (4) grazed only once a year (extensive). Samples were
   taken from each treatment once during May, July, and September 2005.
   Edaphic characteristics and plant diversity were measured, as well as
   microarthropod, nematode, protist, and bacterial functional group
   diversity and abundances. Significant (P < 0.05) effects of treatment
   were observed on percentage of bare soil, plant species and functional
   diversity, and bacterial functional diversity. There were also
   significant (P < 0.05) negative correlations observed between treatment,

Abstract = {{Different components of biodiversity may vary independently of each
   other along environmental gradients giving insights into the mechanisms
   that regulate species coexistence. In particular, the functional
   diversity (FD) or the presence of rare or endemic species in natural
   assemblages do not necessarily increase with species diversity. We
   studied if different components of plant species diversity (species
   richness, Simpson diversity, evenness) varied similarly to FD (measured
   as a generalization of the Simpson index) and rarity along grazing
   intensity and climatic gradients. Plots under different sheep grazing
   regimes (high and low intensity, abandonment) were surveyed in five
   locations along a climatic gradient in north-eastern Spain, from
   semi-arid lowland to moist upland locations. Variation in species
   diversity, functional diversity and rarity followed different patterns.
   Species diversity was lowest in water-stressed environments (arid
   locations and southern aspects) and increased with grazing more makedly
   in humid locations. The FD was comparable between the most species-poor
   and species-rich locations and decreased with grazing in the moistest
   location, i.e. where species diversity markedly increased. The FD did
   not show a strong correlation with species richness nor with the Simpson
   index and less specious communities could show the highest functional
   diversity. The rarest species in the region were more frequently found
   in the abandoned areas, which held the lowest species diversity.
   Consequently, the mechanisms that enhance the diversity of species do
   not necessarily support a functional differentiation among those species
   or the maintenance of rare species in a region. We hypothesize that the
   degree of dependence of functional diversity on species diversity might
   be mostly related to the amplitude of the species' traits pool and on
   how species partition the niche space available.}},

   2. In this field study, four different manipulations were used to
   investigate interactions between V. sepium, ants, aphids, and seed

   3. Grazing negatively affected number of V. sepium buds, flowers, and
   pods. Seed set, defined as the number of developed seeds per number of
   ovules in a pod, was higher in grazed plots. Ant abundance, however, was
   not affected by grazing. Ten different ant species were found on V.
   sepium and the number of ants was positively correlated with the
   presence of EFNs. Aphids were found only when ants were excluded from
   the plants. Pod and seed production of V. sepium plants was not affected
   by the presence of ants. The seed predator B. atomarius was not affected
   by the presence of ants. No support was found for the supposition that
   V. sepium benefited from attracting ants by producing extra floral
   nectar.
   4. A small observational study of V. sepium plants in shrub (Rosa
   dumalis) plots compared with grassland plots was added to the
   experimental study. Vicia sepium plants were longer and had higher
   seed-set (seeds/ovules) in shrub plots than in grassland plots.}},

Abstract = {{We ask whether vole herbivory in experimental grassland plots is

   meadow voles ( Microtus pennsylvanicus) reduced plant standing crop
   between 30\% and 72\%, well within the range of ungulate effects.
   Moreover, meadow voles reduced their available forage species by
   changing the plant community composition: four grass species and a
   legume upon which they foraged declined sharply in cover and/or number
   of individuals, five forbs avoided by voles increased, and two forbs
   neither declined nor increased with either measure. Reductions of
   diversity occurred when voles first defoliated the plots in 2000 but
   disappeared as plant species avoided by voles replaced vulnerable
   plants. Within six years, meadow voles created plant communities
   dominated by species that they did not eat.}},

Abstract = {{The diet selection, made by twelve dry and twelve lactating
   spring-calving Salers beef cows at the end of the grazing season on an
   extensively grazed natural mountain pasture in central France, was
   compared. Sward structure, selection bites, daily grazing time and
   digestibility of the diet were measured in mid-October (P-1) and
   mid-November (P-2). Live weights were measured twice monthly throughout
   the experiment. Daily milk production was assessed in the week before
   the grazing behaviour measurements. Lactating cows grazed more
   selectively than dry cows: they took more bites on green patches (0.20
   vs. 0.13 of total bites, P < 0 01; Jacob's selectivity index: 0.13 vs.
   -0.25, P < 0.001), which is consistent with the higher overall nitrogen
   concentration in faeces (18.1 vs. 17.3 g kg(-1) DM, P < 0.05). Lactating
   cows tended to slightly increase their daily grazing time compared with
   dry cows (on average 9.9 vs. 9.5 h, P = 0.07) and grazed faster in
   mid-November (74 vs. 69 bites min(-1), P < 0.05). The lactating cows
   lost more live weight (-24 vs. -12 kg cow(-1), P < 0.05) between P-1 and
   P-2. A positive correlation was found between consumption of green
   patches by lactating cows and their daily milk production in P-2 (r =
   0.574, P = 0.05), whereas no correlation occurred between individual
   milk production and liveweight loss. Dry cows were less selective, which
   supports management practices that promote the use of cows with low
   requirements on extensively grazed pastures in late season.}},

Abstract = {{In temperate regions, grassland provides most of the feed requirements
   for ruminants. Its management has implications for landscape and
   environmental quality as well as agricultural production. The present
   paper reviews the key developments in grassland management, production
   and utilization during the 20th century, focusing primarily on the UK
   but drawing on research and practice from other areas. Increased
   production from grassland has arisen from improved understanding of soil
   and plant nutrition, plant physiology and cultivar improvement, while
   improved understanding of feed evaluation, ruminant nutrition, grazing
   management and silage technology have contributed to increased
   utilization of grassland under grazing and cutting. Permanent and
   long-term swards occupied most of the total grassland area at both the
   beginning and end of the century, but inputs of nitrogen resulted in
   greatly increased herbage production, particularly from the 1960s; this,
   combined with reseeding and early cutting for silage, led to reduced
   botanical diversity with ryegrass dominance in lowland areas. Forage
   legumes were highly regarded at the beginning of the century, then
   decreased in many areas, but are again recognized as having a key role
   in low- and medium-input systems. Recognition of the environmental
   implications of grassland management has increased since the 1980s. This
   includes the need to reduce nutrient emissions in grassland agriculture,
   and also the role of grassland in biodiversity protection, carbon
   sequestration and landscape quality. Research is increasingly focused on
   addressing these issues and on integrating agricultural management with
   environmental protection. Improved nutrient management, legume-based
   systems and agri-environmental schemes, as well as interest in the food
   quality attributes of particular systems and grassland communities, are
   important in the medium term. In the longer term the effects Of
   population increase, competition for other land uses and the impacts of
   climate change could impact on global food supplies and affect future
   grassland management in the temperate zones.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{1. Grassland restorations often lack rare forb and grass species that
   are found in intact grasslands. The possible reasons for low diversity
   include seed limitation, microsite limitation and a combination of both.
   Native ungulates may create microsites for seedling establishment in
   tallgrass prairie restorations by grazing dominant species or through
   trampling activities, but this has never been tested in developing
   prairies.
   2. We experimentally tested for seed and microsite limitation in the
   largest tallgrass prairie restoration in the USA by adding rare forb and
   grass seeds in two trials inside and outside native ungulate exclosures.
   We measured seedling emergence because this stage is crucial in
   recruiting species into a community. We also measured light, water and
   standing crop biomass to test whether resource availability could help
   to explain seedling emergence rates.
   3. Ungulates increased light availability for each sampling time and
   also increased above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) during
   summer.
   4. Seedling emergence of rare prairie forbs and grasses was consistently
   greater when we added seeds.
   5. Seedling emergence was conditionally greater with a combination of
   seed additions and grazing, but grazing alone was unable to increase
   emergence.
   6. When ungulates increased seedling enhancement, the mechanism was
   partially associated with increased water and light availability.
   7. Exotic and cosmopolitan weed seedling emergence was not affected by
   grazing.
   8. Synthesis and applications. These results suggest that tallgrass
   prairie restorations are primarily seed limited and that grazing alone
   may not be able to increase seedling emergence of rare species without
   the addition of seeds. Therefore, adding seeds to grassland restorations
   may increase seedling emergence of rare species, and mimicking effects
   of grazing may increase emergence when seeds are added.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{791-798}},

Abstract = {{Question: How is grazing intensity associated with species and
   morpho-functional traits (MFFs) composition, productivity and richness
   of annual dominated grasslands? Have native and exotic species similar
   associations to this gradient?
   Location: Anthropogenic grassland in the Espinal vegetation in the
   sub-humid area of the mediterranean type climate region of Chile (35
   degrees 58' S, 72 degrees 17' W).
   Methods: Data were obtained from a long-term (eight years) experiment
   with six stocking rates (1 to 3.5 sheep/ha). Detrended Correspondence
   Analysis (DCA) and regression analysis were used to determinate the
   relationship between grazing intensity and biomass. richness, abundance
   and traits of the species.
   Results: The first DCA axis was related to grazing intensity and
   explained most of the floristic variation (69.3\%); the abundance of
   some non-native species, e.g. Vulpia megalura were highly correlated
   with this axis. In the DCA for MFTs the first axis explained 87\% of the
   variance and was also related to grazing intensity; the abundance of
   small size plants and shallow roots increased with grazing intensity.
   The relative abundance of grasses and composites, but not of legumes,
   changed with stocking rate: as grazing intensity increased composites
   became the predominant species to the detriment of grasses. The
   above-ground biomass measured in exclusion cages declined with
   increasing grazing pressure. The richness of exotic species was greater
   compared to native ones at low stocking rates, but they converge to
   similar values at higher stocking rates. However, the relative abundance
   of exotic species was greater than 75\% in all stocking rates.
   Conclusions: Grazing intensification has large effects in the structure
   of grassland in central Chile. With grazing intensities greater than I
   sheep/ha species characteristics change; evolving in a few years (6-8)
   towards a similar community regardless of the stocking rate. The
   overgrazed community has more native than exotic species richness,
   possibly due to greater defence traits against herbivory of this group
   of species.}},

Volume = {{115}},

Abstract = {{Empirical studies have suggested that species richness of grassland
   insects usually decreases under grazing management. By contrast, grazing
   has been shown to increase the species density and richness of vascular
   plants, especially on productive soils. In order to test the suggested
   differences in response to management between plants and insects, we
   simultaneously studied species richness of vascular plants and their
   insect herbivores, butterflies and moths, in 68 semi-natural grasslands
   with varying grazing intensity and frequency in SW Finland. Species
   richness of plants and insects was for the first time related to a
   quantitative measure of disturbance intensity and successional age, mean
   vegetation height, by using generalized additive models (GAM). The
   effects of soil nutrients on vegetation height were accounted for by
   using phosphorus concentration as a productivity surrogate.
   The results showed that species richness of butterflies and moths peaked
   in taller vegetation compared with vascular plants, corresponding to a
   lower disturbance intensity and increasing time since abandonment. These
   patterns are discussed in the light of two hypotheses, the ``structural
   diversity hypothesis{''} and ``dynamic equilibrium model{''} of Huston,
   both suggesting a weaker disturbance tolerance of insects compared with
   plants. Butterflies and moths which are specialists in their larval
   host-plant use (monophagous and oligophagous species) preferred lower
   vegetation (higher disturbances) compared with generalists (polyphagous
   species), as predicted by Huston's model. This difference indicates a
   stronger relationship with plant species richness for specialist than
   for generalist butterflies and moths. Our results support the
   application of regionally and temporally varying grazing intensities in
   grassland conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing has long been the most widespread land use on the
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, one of the world's highest ecosystems. However,
   there has been increasing concern during recent decades because of the
   rapid increase in livestock numbers. To assess the possible influences
   of grazing on the vast grassland, a long-term grazing experiment in a
   shrub meadow on the northern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was carried out. The
   experiment included five treatments with different stocking rates and
   one non-grazing (N) treatment. After 17 years of grazing, treatment
   differences were clear. The species composition differed markedly
   between grazing intensities, with a decrease in palatable grass species
   and an increase in unpalatable forbs at higher grazing intensities. The
   species richness and species diversity, however, were not significantly
   different between treatments. Vegetation height decreased significantly
   at higher grazing intensities. Total above,ground biomass declined
   considerably and the biomass of forbs increased significantly under the
   higher grazing intensities. The amount of litter was significantly lower
   under the higher grazing intensities. The results suggest that long-term
   grazing alters the species composition, vegetation height and biomass
   production of the alpine grassland ecosystem without significantly
   changing species richness.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are hot spots of biodiversity but are now widely threatened
   by changes in patterns of disturbances, such as grazing and fire
   regimes, exotic species invasions, and cultivation. The goal of this
   experiment was to find the most appropriate combination of treatments to
   reintroduce Danthonia californica, a formerly dominant perennial
   bunchgrass, into degraded California coastal prairies. Danthonia
   californica was sown from seed and transplanted at two sites and at two
   grazing intensities (grazed/ungrazed) in a multifactorial experiment
   testing the effects of (1) local versus nonlocal seed sources; (2)
   topsoil removal; and (3) reduction of plant neighbors. Seed emergence
   was very low, suggesting that transplanting may be a better option to
   reintroduce D. californica. Although transplants grown from nonlocal
   seeds survived better initially at both sites, transplants from local
   seeds had higher survival after 1.5 year at one site. This suggests that
   short-term plant establishment studies may be misleading. Topsoil
   removal greatly enhanced transplant survival, and neighbor removal
   primarily increased transplant growth. Our results suggest that removing
   topsoil prior to transplanting seedlings grown from local seeds is the
   most promising method to reintroduce D. californica. However, the
   benefits of removing topsoil to provide safe sites for plant
   establishment should be weighed carefully against potential negative
   effects on the native seed bank and microbial communities on a
   site-specific basis.}},

Abstract = {{This review of grader grass (Themeda quadrivalvis) attempts to collate
   current knowledge and identify knowledge gaps that may require further
   research. Grader grass is a tropical annual grass native to India that
   is now spread throughout many of the tropical regions of the world. In
   Australia, it has spread rapidly since its introduction in the 1930s and
   is now naturalised in the tropical areas of Queensland, the Northern
   Territory and Western Australia and extends south along the east coast
   to northern New South Wales. It is a vigorous grass with limited
   palatability, that is capable of invading native and improved pastures,
   cropping land and protected areas such as state and national parks.
   Grader grass can form dense monocultures that reduce biodiversity,
   decrease animal productivity and increase the fire hazard in the
   seasonally dry tropics. Control options are based on herbicides, grazing
   management and slashing, while overgrazing appears to favour grader
   grass. The effect of fire on grader grass is inconclusive and needs to
   be defined. Little is known about the biology and impacts of grader
   grass in agricultural and protected ecosystems in Australia. In
   particular, information is needed on soil seed bank longevity, seed
   production, germination and growth, which would allow the development of
   management strategies to control this weedy grass.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grassland communities are of great interest in conservation
   because of their high species richness. These communities are being
   threatened by both land abandonment and nitrogen eutrophication, and
   their continued existence will depend upon correct management. However,
   there is a distinct lack of studies of the ecological mechanisms that
   regulate species diversity and productivity in Mediterranean grasslands.
   We have conducted a 3-year field experiment in a species-poor grassland
   in central Italy to investigate the effects of nitrogen fertilization
   coupled with removal of plant litter and artificial cutting on species
   diversity and community productivity. Vegetation cutting reduced living
   biomass but increased species diversity. In fact, cutting had positive
   effects on the cover of almost all of the annual and biennial species,
   while it had a negative effect on the dominant perennial grasses
   Brachypodium rupestre and Dactylis glomerata. Litter removal had similar
   effects to cutting, although it was far less effective in increasing
   species diversity. in contrast, nitrogen enrichment strongly increased
   the living biomass while maintaining very low species diversity. our
   results have indicated that semi-natural Mediterranean grasslands need
   specific management regimes for maintenance and restoration of species
   diversity. In the management of these grasslands, attention should be
   paid to the potential threat from nitrogen enrichment, especially when
   coupled with land abandonment. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights

Abstract = {{Farmland birds have suffered a severe decline in recent years throughout
   Europe including Ireland. Agricultural intensification is believed to be
   the main cause and this has led to the introduction of
   agri-environmental schemes, of which set-aside is a part. Bird abundance
   and diversity were compared between set-aside and adjacent tillage or
   grassland at 18 locations. The set-aside sites were also assigned to one
   of four management types: rotational set-aside, non-rotational
   set-aside, first year set-aside that was productive grassland in the
   previous year, and long-term set-aside that was grazed by animals in
   winter. Species diversity and the abundances of skylark, meadow pipit
   and woodpigeon were significantly greater in set-aside sites. Species
   diversity was not significantly different between set-aside management
   types and meadow pipit, skylark, pheasant, house sparrow, magpie, snipe
   and starling were closely associated with non-rotational set-aside,
   which also contained significantly larger numbers of these species
   compared to the other set-aside types. This study shows that set-aside
   does enhance bird diversity and abundance and that, in Ireland, the most
   effective form of set-aside is non-rotational. It also shows that the
   most appropriate form of set-aside will vary from situation to situation
   and that a one size fits all view should not be taken in the development
   of agri-environmental schemes. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An animal's ability to select a diet depends on forage availability, the
   density of herbivores, and the allocation of forage resources. We
   hypothesized that the temporal and spatial availability of forages in
   sagebrush steppe vegetation both influence food selection and may
   encourage lambs to learn to use sagebrush, a shrub that contains high
   levels of terpenes that limit food intake. We conducted a field study
   with three treatments of 20 lambs each. Forage resources were
   manipulated by restricting grazing areas. Lambs in treatment H grazed at
   a high stock density, whereas lambs in treatment L grazed at a low stock
   density; both groups were moved to fresh pasture daily. Lambs in
   treatment H3 had three times the area of treatment H, but they were
   moved every 3 days, making the total area grazed by H and H3 equal, but
   with a different temporal allocation of forage. Scan sampling was used
   to record the incidence of consumption among sagebrush and understory
   herbs. During 24 days of conditioning, stock density and temporal
   patterns of forage allocation both influenced the behavior of lambs.
   Lambs in H spent more time foraging on sagebrush (25\%) than lambs in H3
   (16\%), and lambs in both H and H3 spent more time foraging on sagebrush
   than lambs in L (1\%) (P < 0.05). For lambs in H3, foraging on sagebrush
   was cyclic and depended on the daily availability of herbs. Use of
   sagebrush, expressed as a percentage of total foraging time, was < 1 \%
   for day 1, 13\% for day 2, and 37\% for day 3 (P < 0.0001). Importantly,
   use of sagebrush by H3 and H increased steadily as the trial progressed,
   whereas use of sagebrush by L was consistently low (P < 0.05). Following
   conditioning, when lambs were tested at low stock densities during
   preference test 1, use of sagebrush did not differ by groups, but at
   higher stock densities in preference test 2, their use of sagebrush
   varied by treatments: H > H3 > L (P < 0.005). Thus, the availability of
   alternative foods, manipulated through animal density and the temporal
   allocation of those resources, both affected how readily lambs learned
   to use sagebrush. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Were continued groundwater discharge and mowing regimes
   sufficient for vegetation preservation from 1944 to 1993? Which has a
   stronger effect on vegetation development; groundwater discharge or
   mowing? What is the role of surface water eutrophication as driver of
   vegetation change?
   Location: Het Hol, The Netherlands (ca. 92 ha, 52 degrees 13' N, 5
   degrees 05' E).
   Methods: Hydrology was simulated for the late 1940s, early 1960s and
   1987. Vegetation maps (1944, 1960, 1975 and 1993) were compared for
   biotope cover. Vegetation recordings in 1944 and 1987 were compared.
   Surface water quality was compared between 1950 and 1987. Which sites
   were mown was reconstructed from an interview. Effects of periodic
   mowing and groundwater discharge on vegetation development were tested
   for correlation.
   Results: Biotope diversity reduced significantly through decrease of
   semi-aquatic and tall-herb biotopes, and expansion of forest. The
   quagfen terrestrialization sere nearly disappeared from 1987 recordings,
   while the reed sere did well concerning abundance and species richness.
   Several typical (rich) fen species disappeared from recordings, while
   new species were mostly field margin species. Periodic mowing and
   discharge combined are correlated with increasing species numbers. The
   P-concentration in surface water increased while N-concentration
   decreased.
   Conclusions: Preservation of the reed sere was successful, whereas
   preservation of the quagfen sere was not. Periodic mowing and discharge
   stimulate species richness, discharge more so than periodic mowing. But
   slight eutrophication likely induced a shift from P-limitation to
   N-limitation, which stimulated the reed sere at the expense of the
   quagfen sere.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Question: How does seed dispersal reduce fen isolation and contribute to
   biodiversity?
   Location: European and North American fens.
   Methods: This paper reviews the literature on seed dispersal to fens.
   Results: Landscape fragmentation may reduce dispersal opportunities
   thereby isolating fens and reducing genetic exchange. Species in
   fragmented wetlands may have lower reproductive success, which can lead
   to biodiversity loss. While fens may have always been relatively
   isolated from each other, they have become increasingly fragmented in
   modem times within agricultural and urban landscapes in both Europe and
   North America. Dispersal by water, animals and wind has been hampered by
   changes related to development in landscapes surrounding fens. Because
   the seeds of certain species are long-lived in the seed bank, frequent
   episodes of dispersal are not always necessary to maintain the
   biodiversity of fens. However, of particular concern to restoration is
   that some dominant species, such as the tussock sedge Carex stricta, may
   not disperse readily between fens.
   Conclusions: Knowledge of seed dispersal can be used to maintain and
   restore the biodiversity of fens in fragmented landscapes. Given that
   development has fragmented landscapes and that this situation is not
   likely to change, the dispersal of seeds might be enhanced by moving hay
   or cattle from fens to damaged sites, or by reestablishing lost
   hydrological connections.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Can the biodiversity of fens in Europe and North America be
   maintained through the use of grazing (especially cattle grazing), fire,
   and/or cutting?
   Location: European and North American fens.
   Methods: This paper is a review of the literature on the effects of
   grazing, fire and cutting on fens, to explore the relationship between
   management and biodiversity in fens.
   Results: A reduction of cattle grazing, mowing and burning in fens has
   led to a reduction in biodiversity in fens. The vegetation of abandoned
   fens shifts to trees and shrubs after 10-15 years, which shade the
   smaller and rarer species of these wetlands. While careful use of fire
   is used to manage fens in North America, it is not widely used in
   European fens, perhaps because the peat of drained fens may catch fire.
   Cattle grazing cannot be considered a natural disturbance in North
   America, since cattle did not evolve on that continent. In Europe,
   cattle do not generally graze in unaltered fens, but they do use
   slightly drained fen meadows.
   Conclusions: Three approaches have been used to control the dominance of
   tall woody and herbaceous species in abandoned fens, including the
   re-introduction of cattle, mowing, and burning. Overgrazing results in a
   permanent reduction in biodiversity, therefore cattle re-introduction
   must be approached cautiously. In Europe, but not in North America,
   mowing has been an important management tool, and mowing has been
   successful in maintaining species richness, particularly in fens that
   have been mowed annually for centuries. Fire has been the most common

Abstract = {{Connell's `intermediate disturbance hypothesis' was tested using a
   relatively simple, species poor isopod community in grass heaths and in
   a coastal sand dune grassland. Variation in diversity resulted from
   disturbance both to the soil profile and sward structure due to grazing.
   Predictions from a spatial survey were tested using a 20 years time
   series. These changes were related to changes in rabbit activity,
   anthropogenic soil disturbance and on one site, deposition of blown
   sand. Changes in the soil profile resulted in diversity initially
   increasing due to decreases in the density of the commonest species,
   leading to an increase in equitability. Prolonged disturbance to the
   soil profile both due to sand blowing onto one site and rotavating on
   another, lead to a reduction in diversity due to one of the species
   being eliminated. The isopod community was most diverse when least
   disturbed by grazing, of intermediate diversity under intermediate
   grazing intensity and least diverse when most heavily grazed. In these
   simple communities, differences in diversity were mostly determined by
   differences in equitability rather than in species richness. We conclude
   that maximising heterogeneity of sward structure could have advantages
   for the conservation of both invertebrate biodiversity and vertebrates
   that feed on them. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Differences in beetle community structures between not re-cultivated
   over 60 years old forest and 10 years old re-cultivated meadow and
   shrubs were compared. On each locality there were arranged three
   replicates of 10 pitfall trap rows. Mean abundance of beetles was
   significantly greater on old forest stand than re-cultivated meadow.
   However no significant differences between localities in species
   richness and non parametric index of diversity (Shannon H') were
   recorded: Rank-abundance curves for newly established communities best
   fits to geometric model of distribution (r = 0.98, P < 0.001) which is
   characteristic for species poor communities, where a single
   environmental resource is extremely important, meanwhile old stand,
   without any reclamation practice is best fitted to lognormal
   distribution model (r = 0.99, P < 0.001) which is typical for more
   stable and well developed communities. Principal component analysis for
   log (N+1) transformed matrix of abundances, described well 60\% of the
   total variance. Two clear groups of species transects were derived: one
   concentrated assemblages of both reclaimed and newly established
   communities and the second one old non reclaimed forest stands.
   Significant feature of trophic guild structure in all three communities
   is the lowest abundance of decomposers meanwhile predators predominate
   on non re-cultivated old sites and herbivores on reclaimed young stands.

Abstract = {{Increasing plant diversity has long been hypothesized to negatively
   affect levels of invertebrate herbivory due to a lower number of
   specialist insect herbivores in more diverse sites, but studies of
   natural systems have been rare. We used a planned comparison to study
   herbivory in a set of 19 semi-natural montane grasslands managed as hay
   meadows. Herbivory was measured in transects through the plant
   communities, and in individuals of Plantago lanceolata and Trifolium
   pratense that were transplanted into each meadow. In addition, plant
   community biomass and arthropod abundances were determined in the
   grasslands. Before the first mowing in June, mean herbivory levels
   correlated negatively with plant species richness, as predicted by
   theory, but they were also significantly affected by plant community
   biomass and plant community composition. After mowing, herbivory levels
   were only significantly related to plant community composition. Damage
   levels in the transplants were lower than herbivory levels in the
   established plant communities. Most insect herbivores were generalists
   and not specialists. The number of insect herbivores and spiders were
   positively correlated and tended to increase with increasing plant
   species richness. Herbivory levels were correlated negatively with
   spider abundances. We conclude that while the predicted negative
   relationship between plant species richness and insect herbivory can be
   found in grasslands, the underlying mechanism involves generalist rather
   than specialist herbivores. Our data also suggest a role of natural
   enemies in generalist herbivore activities.}},

Abstract = {{Housing developments are replacing ranches in the southwestern United
   States, with potentially significant but little-studied ecological
   effects. We counted grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Acrididae) and measured
   vegetative cover for 2 years in a grassland and mesquite/oak savanna in
   southeastern Arizona, on 48 transects that were grazed by livestock,
   embedded in low-density housing developments, or both, or neither.
   Grasshopper species richness was unrelated to grazing or development,
   but grasshopper abundance was much higher on exurban transects where
   homeowners kept livestock than in the other areas. Forb canopy and basal
   area also were highest in grazed exurban areas, perhaps because exurban
   grazing was relatively patchy, frequently involved horses, and created
   disturbances more conducive to forb establishment than did relatively
   uniform grazing on nearby ranches. Abundance patterns of 3 grasshopper
   subfamilies were generally consistent with their known habitat
   preferences. Counts of grass-feeding Gomphocerinae were relatively high
   in ungrazed and unburned areas, and positively correlated with grass
   cover. Numbers of forb- and mixed-feeding Melanoplinae were positively
   correlated with forb cover across all transects, and melanoplines
   dominated counts on grazed exurban properties. Band-winged grasshoppers
   (Oedipodinae) prefer areas of sparse vegetation, and their numbers were
   negatively correlated with height of ground vegetation and positively
   associated with the presence of livestock, in both exurban and
   undeveloped landscapes. Overall, our results suggest that heterogeneous
   landscapes in exurban areas that included small livestock pastures had
   higher grasshopper densities than either ungrazed areas or large cattle
   ranches.}},

Abstract = {{Currently over 14.6 million ha of land at an annual cost of US\$1.76
   billion are enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CPP). The
   habitat benefits of CRP frequently are lauded, but documentation that
   wildlife is responding as hoped is urgently needed. We evaluated plant
   and breeding bird responses to 92.4 ha of CPP grasslands at China Farms
   in northeastern Maryland, USA. In 1999 we seeded 12 contiguous CRP
   fields with 5 mixtures of warm-season grasses representing various
   growth-form heights in a replicated experimental design, and used mowing
   and topical herbicide applications to control noxious weeds and
   facilitate stand establishment. In 6 years cumulative plant species
   richness increased to 261, 105 of which were species exotic to the
   region. During the third growing season, we initiated a schedule of
   prescribed burning on a 3-year rotation to remove accumulated litter and
   to retard woody succession, and in 2003 we added additional management
   to control aggressive plant species. Several at-risk bird species
   colonized the restored grasslands in the first year and established
   sustainable breeding populations. We implemented a comprehensive
   observation and banding program, which included mapping male territories
   for selected bird species and recording nest locations. We marked 1,985
   grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum; GRSPs) in 7 years. Breeding
   GRSP populations ranged annually from 70 to 90 socially monogamous pairs
   with an additional 40 non-territorial males. Annual return rates in the
   last 5 years were 57\% for adult males, 41\% for adult females, and 12\%
   for hatch-year individuals. Adults and young birds exhibited high site
   fidelity, but overgrown fields left unburned for 2-3 years were
   unpopulated by GRSPs but attracted several shrub-land bird species.
   Habitat preference for territories was influenced more by vegetation
   structure than by plant species composition. We recommend the management
   of grasslands restored for birds include spatial and temporal rotation
   of prescribed fire and herbicide applications to sustain vegetation
   physical structure rather than species composition.}},

Abstract = {{Mowing is frequently used for restoring plant communities in abandoned
   meadows which were previously managed by cattle grazing and mowing. The
   aim of this study was to search for the most optimal mowing treatment
   maximising plant species richness in a dry-mesic meadow in northern
   Finland. In an earlier restoration attempt at the same study site,
   traditional mowing in mid to late August was applied for five years
   (1993-1997). Because this first attempt had negligible effects on plant
   community structure, a new five-year experiment was conducted
   (1998-2003) in order to test for the effects of different mowing regimes
   (early mowing in June, late mowing in August, late mowing + soil
   disturbance in August, and untreated control plots). In spite of
   considerable species turnover at the level of individual plots, the
   treatments had no statistically significant effect on species turnover
   and species richness per plot. Mowing did not suppress the cover of tall
   herbs. Late mowing even favoured the early flowering Geranium
   sylvaticum. Restorative mowing is ineffective against tall competitors
   if the propagule input from the neighbourhood remains high. Early mowing
   and late mowing + soil disturbance, which most strongly decreased
   vegetation height, tended to favour competitively inferior small herbs.
   A reason for a slow response in species richness may lie in seed
   limitation as only one new species appeared during the study. To enhance
   species richness, mowing could be combined with propagule addition in
   cases where the local species pools of meadow species have been
   exhausted.}},

Abstract = {{The main characteristic of landscape evolution in the Pyrenees during
   the 20th century is the increased presence of shrubs in old fields.
   Revegetation is mainly recorded on medium and low slopes because of land
   abandonment. The increase in shrubs causes the loss of grazing resources
   during winter, landscape homogenization and an increase in fire risk.
   The objective of this paper was to create a scenario for land use change
   by combining Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Landscape
   Ecology Analysis (LEA). To improve the present seasonal imbalance in
   pastoral resources, the scenario proposes to convert shrubland areas to
   grasslands without an excessive increase in soil erosion or landscape
   fragmentation. The results obtained indicate that the strategy produces
   greater landscape diversity and an increase in annual pasture resources
   (16.7\%), which exceeds 60\% of total in winter. The effects of
   landscape fragmentation on biodiversity, fire risk control and the
   imbalance of pastures are discussed. The scenario would improve
   extensive livestock farming, which is the most important economic
   activity in this area and other Mediterranean mountains. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{A change in the vegetation of UK moorland from Calluna
   vulgaris-dominated heath to Molinia caerulea- or Nardus
   stricta-dominated grassland is frequently deemed undesirable on economic
   and biodiversity grounds. Moorland vegetation restoration is an
   increasingly practiced management option. However there has been little
   research on the effectiveness of such management for aiding the
   restoration of other aspects of moorland biodiversity such as associated
   insect populations.
   We sampled Hemiptera and Lepidoptera assemblages from restored, degraded
   and C. vulgaris-dominated (target) moorland at eight restoration sites
   in England and Scotland. Vegetation assemblages and additional
   environmental variables were sampled at the same locations.
   Vegetation restoration aided the reassembly of moorland insects to a
   variable extent. Hemiptera restoration success was greatest at
   mechanically restored sites dominated by C. vulgaris. in addition to
   treatment, latitude best explained variation in the Hemiptera
   assemblage. A range of plant species, all either dwarf shrubs or
   graminoids, acted as further determinants. Lepidoptera restoration
   success was correlated most closely with the success of restoring the
   full diversity of the vegetation assemblage and was highest at sites
   restored by grazing control.
   The results demonstrate that vegetation restoration brings wider
   biodiversity benefits and that the form these take may depend on the
   restoration method used and consequent characteristics of the resultant
   vegetation assemblage. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In tallgrass prairie, disturbances such as grazing and fire can generate
   patchiness across the landscape, contributing to a shifting mosaic that
   presumably enhances biodiversity. Grassland birds evolved within the
   context of this shifting mosaic, with some species restricted to one or
   two patch types created under spatially and temporally distinct
   disturbance regimes. Thus, management-driven reductions in heterogeneity
   may be partly responsible for declines in numbers of grassland birds. We
   experimentally altered spatial heterogeneity of vegetation structure
   within a tallgrass prairie by varying the spatial and temporal extent of
   fire and by allowing grazing animals to move freely among burned and
   unburned patches (patch treatment). We contrasted this disturbance
   regime with traditional agricultural management of the region that
   promotes homogeneity (traditional treatment). We monitored grassland
   bird abundance during the breeding seasons of 2001-2003 to determine the
   influence of altered spatial heterogeneity on the grassland bird
   community. Focal disturbances of patch burning and grazing that shifted
   through the landscape over several years resulted in a more
   heterogeneous pattern of vegetation than uniform application of fire and
   grazing. Greater spatial heterogeneity in vegetation provided greater
   variability in the grassland bird community. Some bird species occurred
   in greatest abundance within focally disturbed patches, while others
   occurred in relatively undisturbed patches in our patch. treatment.
   Henslow's Sparrow, a declining species, occurred only within the patch
   treatment. Upland Sandpiper and some other species were more abundant on
   recently disturbed patches within the same treatment. The patch burn
   treatment created the entire gradient of vegetation structure required
   to maintain a suite of grassland bird species that differ in habitat
   preferences. Our study demonstrated that increasing spatial and temporal
   heterogeneity of disturbance in grasslands increases variability in
   vegetation structure that results in greater variability at higher
   trophic levels. Thus, management that creates a shifting mosaic using
   spatially and temporally discrete disturbances in grasslands can be a
   useful tool in. conservation. In the case of North American tallgrass
   prairie, discrete fires that capitalize on preferential grazing behavior
   of large ungulates promote a shifting mosaic of habitat types that
   maintain biodiversity and agricultural productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible conservation management, where measures (e.g., mowing of
   meadows, removing invasive species) are selected in each decision period
   depending on the current state of the ecological system, is generally
   perceived as superior to fixed management, where the same measure is
   applied in each decision period independent of the current state of the
   system. In past comparisons of fixed and flexible conservation
   strategies the additional costs that arise only in flexible strategies
   have usually been ignored. In this paper, we present a framework to
   integrate costs of flexible management into the evaluation of flexible
   conservation strategies. Using the example of an endangered butterfly
   species we demonstrate that the costs of flexible management may reverse
   the rank order of flexible and fixed conservation strategies, such that
   fixed strategies may lead to better ecological results than flexible
   ones for the same financial budget.}},

Abstract = {{As a result of the European Community Common Agricultural Policy reform
   in 2005 it is predicted that livestock grazing in the Scottish uplands
   will become less intensive. At each of two upland research centres, two
   large (> 40ha) plots were established to investigate the relationship
   between grazing intensity in the Scottish uplands and biodiversity. One
   plot was grazed intensively by sheep while the other was grazed
   extensively. Ground beetles were sampled by pitfall trapping to
   determine the influence of grazing pressure on the ecological make-up of
   ground beetle assemblages. Grazing intensity did not significantly
   influence carabid diversity. However, grazing intensity, altitude and
   moisture did influence the carabid ecological assemblage structure at
   both locations. Large flightless Carabus species were more abundant in
   extensively managed plots than intensively managed plots at both
   locations. It is likely that these long-living, relatively immobile
   beetles were favoured by the greater stability of the vegetation
   structure in the extensively grazed plots. Monitoring the ecological
   assemblage structure provides a more sensitive approach than diversity
   indices when comparing the impact of grazing and agricultural management
   but is also robust enough to allow direct comparisons between different
   geographical locations.}},

Abstract = {{1. The accelerating extinction rate of plant species and its effect on
   ecosystem functioning is a hotly debated topic in ecological research.
   Most research projects concerning the relationship between species
   diversity and productivity have been conducted in artificial plant
   communities, with only a few in natural ecosystems. In this study we
   examined the relationship between species diversity and above-ground net
   primary productivity (ANPP) over two consecutive growth seasons (2004
   and 2005) in a semi-arid steppe ecosystem of northern China, that were
   subjected to different land uses.
   2. Land use affected the relationship between species diversity and ANPP
   in this semi-arid steppe ecosystem. Exclusion of grazing without or with
   biomass removal by mowing increased ANPP, species richness and species
   diversity compared with free grazing; the effect was reflected mainly as
   enhanced importance of the perennial forbs functional group in terms of
   their relative contributions to ANPP, plant cover and plant abundance.
   3. Many mechanisms regulate the relationship between species diversity
   and productivity. Differential effects of anthropogenic activities on
   biodiversity and ecosystem functioning greatly complicate the analysis
   of such relationships. On grazing-exclusion sites the relationship
   between ANPP and species richness can be best described as an
   exponential growth function (R-2 = 0.99, P < 0.001, n = 24); whereas on
   the free-grazing site the relationship takes the form of exponential
   decay (R-2 = 0.96, P < 0.001, n = 24). Our study concludes that the mode
   and severity of disturbance are important factors for interpreting the
   relationship between species diversity and productivity in semi-arid
   steppe ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The role of ruminal bacteria in the frothy bloat complex common to
   cattle grazing winter wheat has not been previously determined. Two
   experiments, one in vitro and another in vivo, were designed to
   elucidate the effects of fresh wheat forage on bacterial growth, biofilm
   complexes, rumen fermentation end products, rumen bacterial diversity,
   and bloat potential. In Exp. 1, 6 strains of ruminal bacteria
   (Streptococcus bovis strain 26, Prevotella ruminicola strain 23,
   Eubacterium ruminantium B1C23, Ruminococcus albus SY3, Fibrobacter
   succinogenes ssp. S85, and Ruminococcus flauefaciens C94) were used in
   vitro to determine the effect of soluble plant protein from winter wheat
   forage on specific bacterial growth rate, biofilm complexes, VFA, and
   ruminal H-2 and CH4 in mono or coculture with Methanobrevibacter
   smithii. The specific growth rate in plant protein medium containing
   soluble plant protein (3.27\% nitrogen) was measured during a 24-h
   incubation at 39 degrees C in Hungate tubes under a CO2 gas phase. A
   monoculture of M. smithii was grown similarly, except under H-2:CO2
   (1:1), in a basal methanogen growth medium supplemented likewise with
   soluble plant protein. In Exp. 2, 6 ruminally carmulated steers grazing
   wheat forage were used to evaluate the influence of bloat on the
   production of biofilm complexes, ruminal microbial biodiversity
   patterns, and ruminal fluid protein fractions. In Exp. 1, cultures of R.
   albus (P < 0.01) and R. flavefaciens (P < 0.05) produced the most H-2
   among strains and resulted in greater (P < 0.01) CH4 production when
   cocultured with M. smithii than other coculture combinations. Cultures
   of S. bovis and E. ruminantium + M. smithii produced the most biofilm
   mass among strains. In Exp. 2, when diets changed from bermudagrass hay
   to wheat forage, biofilm production increased (P < 0.01). Biofilm
   production, concentrations of whole ruminal content (P < 0.01), and
   cheesecloth filtrate protein fractions (P < 0.05) in the ruminal fluid
   were greater on d 50 for bloated than for nonbloated steers when grazing
   wheat forage. The molecular analysis of the 16S rDNA showed that 2
   different ruminal microbiota populations developed between bloated and
   nonbloated animals grazing wheat forage. Bloat in cattle grazing wheat
   pastures may be caused by increased production of biofilm, resulting
   from a diet-influenced switch in the rumen bacterial population.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: How do species diversity, frequency and composition in
   tussocks differ from those in similar sized plots outside tussocks? Does
   the extent of the differences depend on community types or environmental
   conditions?
   Location: A sub-alpine grassland in the Swiss National Park.
   Methods: In each of the two communities (short grass and tall graminoid)
   differing in species composition, grazing intensity and soil nutrient
   availability, releves were made in 40 pairs of small circular plots,
   with one plot located inside a randomly selected Carex sempervirens
   tussock and the other outside.
   Results: We found 92 vascular species, of which 46 had a frequency
   higher than 5\%. Species richness (S), pooled cover, Shannon's diversity
   (H) and cumulative species number (CS) were higher outside than inside
   the C. sempervirens tussocks, but evenness (J) was lower. S, H and CS
   differed more in the tall graminoid community than in the short grass
   community. However, dissimilarity between the paired releves inside and
   outside tussocks did not differ between the two communities. Of the 46
   most frequent species, 12 were statistically more and only one less
   frequent outside than inside the tussocks. Vegetation inside and outside
   tussocks could be clearly distinguished in the ordination space.
   Conclusion: Vegetation inside C. sempervirens tussocks is different from
   that in the surrounding area and represents an impoverished but
   homogenized version of the surrounding vegetation. Although tussocks of
   C. sempervirens were systematically avoided by grazers, there is little
   evidence that tussocks facilitate the species growing inside them.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation trends due to climatic changes are difficult to separate from
   disturbances caused by varying land uses. To separate climatic
   influences from livestock grazing and fire disturbances within sagebrush
   steppe, we compared vegetation structure and productivity during 2
   periods (10-year sequences of data from the late 1950s to the late 1960s
   and 3 years in the early 1990s) at 12 stands within 3 relief areas in or
   near the Great Rift of southern Idaho. Year-to-vear fluctuations in
   annual net aboveground phytomass accumulation (ANAPA) were considerable
   in response to varying climate during both periods. More importantly, an
   apparently significant increase in ANAPA was observed during the latter
   study period. However, this apparent increase may have been due to the
   unusually wet conditions of 1993. Throughout both study periods, ANAPA
   was even more positively correlated with species richness than with
   precipitation, although both influences were statistically significant.
   Aggregation of these data by plant growth forms showed that shrubs,
   particularly sagebrushes, have progressively increased their proportion
   relative to herbaceous understory This directional (successional) change
   in the proportional contributions of growth forms to ANAPA was probably
   due more to long-term absence of fire at these isolated locations than
   to any detectable climate change or lack of grazing. This finding
   reduces our confidence in the use of such areas as reference sites for
   monitoring or as living examples for restoration efforts, but it does
   increase Our understanding of vegetation dynamics within sagebrush
   steppe.}},

Title = {{Trophic diversity in two grassland ecosystems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 29}},
Abstract = {{The roles of consumers (top-down forces) versus resources (bottom-up
   forces) as determinants of alpha diversity in a community are not well
   studied. Numerous community ecology models and empirical studies have
   provided a framework for understanding how density at various trophic
   levels responds to variation in the relative strength of top-down and
   bottom-up forces. The resulting trophic theory can be applied to
   understanding variation in insect diversity at different trophic levels.
   The objective of this research was to elucidate the strengths of direct
   and indirect interactions between plants and entire arthropod
   communities to determine the effects of trophic interactions on
   arthropod diversity. Grassland plant and insect diversity was measured
   in July 2001 to document patterns of diversity at multiple trophic
   levels. The study site includes riparian grasslands in North-Central
   Colorado on the Carpenter Ranch, owned and managed by The Nature
   Conservancy. This pastureland consists of sites with different
   management regimes: unmanaged pasture intermixed along riparian forest,
   and cattle grazed pasture with flood irrigation. Plant abundance and
   richness were higher on the grazed-irrigated pasture versus the
   unmanaged field. Path analysis revealed strong effects of herbivore
   diversity on diversity of other trophic levels. For the managed fields,
   top-down forces were important, with increases in enemy diversity
   depressing herbivore diversity, which in turn depressed plant abundance.
   For the unmanaged fields, bottom-up forces dominated, with increases in
   plant diversity causing increased herbivore diversity, which in turn
   increased enemy diversity. These results support hypotheses from other
   empirical studies, demonstrating that changes in diversity of a single
   trophic level can cascade to effect diversity at other, nonadjacent
   trophic levels.}},

Abstract = {{A number of studies have reported that consumers affect a range of
   community-level processes, and in turn their diversity and abundance is
   influenced by the structure and diversity of the plant community.
   Although gastropods are important generalist herbivores in many
   environments, few studies have examined the effects of plant species
   richness and plant community structure on gastropods. This study
   investigated gastropod species richness and interactions with various
   above-ground parameters of the vegetation on an experimental field with
   four plant treatments: low and high diversity of sown later succession
   plant species, natural colonization at the start of the experiment and
   natural colonization after 3 years of continued agricultural practice.
   The investigated gastropod assemblage contained only seven species and
   was highly dominated by two of them. Both in pitfalls and with
   hand-sorting the number of species collected per plot was highest in
   plots with natural plant colonization. Multivariate analysis revealed
   that overall gastropod abundance was positively associated with plant
   height and percentage cover of plants, and negatively with percentage
   grass cover. The same pattern holds for one of the dominant
   species-complex (Cochlicopa lubrica/lubricella). The other dominant
   gastropod species (Deroceras reticulatum) was more abundant in samples
   with higher percentages of moss cover and higher plant diversity, while
   less abundant at samples with higher plant cover, indicating that the
   gastropod species preferences may matter more than just their response
   to plant diversity.
   Two plant-gastropod species-level associations were observed: Senecio
   jacobaea with D. reticulatum and Tanacetum vulgare with Cochlicopa spp.
   The present study also demonstrated that pitfall-traps are suitable for
   collecting terrestrial gastropods, at least for species-poor grassland
   habitats. (c) 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Broom (Cytisus scoparius) is considered an invasive species in countries
   outside its native range and a significant colonizing species in Europe.
   In particular this shrub rapidly invades pastures after grazing
   cessation in central France mid-elevation mountains. In order to better
   understand the effects of broom plants on vegetation composition and
   species richness after grazing abandonment, a study was conducted
   including stand descriptions and impact on light availability and soil
   properties. A total of 50 plots were sampled from the following
   categories: grazed pasture free of broom colonization, abandoned pasture
   in the process of being colonized by broom plants (1-3 years old),
   intermediate broom stand (2-4 years old), mature broom stand (4-5 years
   old) and dead broom stand (8-10 years old). In each plot the vegetation
   composition was measured; additionally, broom size and density were
   recorded. Light transmittance was measured beneath the broom canopy.
   Soil moisture, soil carbon (C), soil nitrogen (N), and nitrate
   production were measured in a subset of plots. Results showed that broom
   colonization is associated with a decline in species richness and cover,
   with a shift toward fast-growing species in the understory compared to
   uninvaded abandoned pasture. After broom decay stands were dominated by
   Rubus sp. plants. Concomitant to broom colonization and vegetation
   changes, light was severely reduced as only 11\% of the incident light
   reached the floor in mature broom stands. In contrast soil moisture, N
   and C contents increased, respectively, of 37\%, 52\% and 61\% in the
   upper soil layer from uncolonized pasture to mature broom stands and
   nitrate production was multiplied by 6.5. However changes in delta N-15
   values were not significant. Dead broom stands were characterized by
   lower values of N, C, and N mineralization as compared with the other
   types of broom stand. Our data suggest that land abandonment and broom
   colonization is associated with altered vegetation composition and
   resource availability and that this shrub tends to occupy a
   mid-successional position between early successional communities such as
   heathlands and grasslands and late-successional woodlands. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{Flood-plain meadows (Alopecurus-Sanguisorba grassland) are a
   floristically rich community of conservation importance throughout
   Europe. Declines in their distribution due in part to modern farming
   practices mean they now cover less than 1500 ha in the UK. To
   investigate the effect of grazing regime during the re-creation of this
   grassland type, target plant species were sown onto ex-arable land
   during 1985. Traditional management, based on a July hay cut followed by
   aftermath grazing was subsequently instigated, and the site was divided
   into replicated grazing regimes of cattle, sheep and an un-grazed
   control. Plant and beetle assemblages were sampled and compared to those
   of target flood-plain meadows and improved grassland communities. Within
   the re-creation treatments the absence of aftermath grazing reduced
   beetle abundances and species richness. Assemblages of plants were
   closest to that of the target flood-plain meadow under sheep grazing,
   although this differed little from cattle grazing. Beetle species
   assemblages and functional group structure were, however, closest to the
   target grassland under cattle grazing. For all taxa the greatest
   resilience to succession to the target flood-plain meadow occurred when
   grazing was not part of the management prescription. Although successful
   re-creation had not been achieved for either the plants or beetles,
   cutting followed by aftermath cattle grazing has provided the best
   management to date. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Grasshoppers are insect herbivores common to grassland ecosystems
   worldwide. They comprise important components of biodiversity,
   contribute significantly to grassland function, and periodically exhibit
   both local and large-scale outbreaks. Because of grasshoppers' potential
   economic importance as competitors with ungulate grazers for rangeland
   forage, periodic grasshopper outbreaks in western US rangeland often
   elicit intervention over large areas in the form of chemical control.
   Available information combined with alternative underlying conceptual
   frameworks suggests that new approaches for sustainable management of
   grasshopper outbreaks in US rangeland should be pursued. There are many
   reasons to believe that approaches to grasshopper management that aim to
   reduce or prevent outbreaks are possible. These habitat manipulation
   tactics maintain existing ecological feedbacks responsible for
   sustaining populations at economically nonthreatening levels.
   Sustainable strategies to minimize the likelihood and extent of
   grasshopper outbreaks while limiting the need for chemical intervention

Abstract = {{Increasing species richness of temperate pastures beyond one or two

   in western Illinois, USA, was initiated in August 2001 to test this
   idea. The main study objective was to determine how pastures sown with
   increasing levels of species richness would affect herbage yield and
   cow-calf performance. Three seed mixtures that contained three, five, or
   eight forage species were sown into 3- to 6-ha pastures. Mixtures were
   replicated three times and rotationally stocked with beef cow-calf
   groups. Herbage mass and accumulation were estimated by a rising plate
   meter method and weight gain evaluated cow-calf performance. We also
   evaluated forage nutritive value indices and changes in forage species
   composition. After pasture establishment in 2001, herbage mass was
   marginally higher (P = 0.15) in eight-species mixtures (98 g m(-2))
   compared with three-species mixes (43 g m(-2)). Once grazing started,
   pasture mix had no effect on herbage responses or stocking rate (P >
   0.05). Cow-calf performance was also unaffected by pasture mix, although
   average daily gain (ADG) was higher in 2003 (P < 0.05). Cow and calf ADG
   averaged 0.33 and 1.17 kg d(-1), respectively, in 2003 compared with
   0.05 and 1.01 kg d(-1) in other years. Overall, species richness in
   pastures had minimal effects on forage yield and cattle performance.
   Grazing management (e.g., stocking rate) and climatic conditions more

Title = {{Shifts in grassland invasibility: Effects of soil resources,
   disturbance, composition, and invader size}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2264-2277}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There is an emerging recognition that invasibility is not an intrinsic
   community trait, but is a condition that fluctuates from interactions
   between environmental forces and residential characters. Elucidating the
   spatiotemporal complexities of invasion requires inclusion of multiple,
   ecologically variable factors within communities of differing structure.
   Water and nutrient amendments, disturbance, and local composition affect
   grassland invasibility but no study has simultaneously integrated these,
   despite evidence that they frequently interact. Using a split-plot
   factorial design, we tested the effects of these factors on the
   invasibility of C-3 pasture communities by smooth pigweed Amaranthus
   hybridus L., a problematic C-4 forb. We sowed seeds and transplanted
   3-week old seedlings of A. hybridus into plots containing monocultures
   and mixtures of varying composition, subjected plots to water, soil
   disturbance, and synthetic bovine urine (SBU) treatments, and measured
   A. hybridus emergence, recruitment, and growth rate. Following SBU
   addition, transplanted seedling growth increased in all plots but
   differed among legume and nonlegume monocultures and mixtures of these
   plant types. However, SBU decreased the number and recruitment rate of
   emerged seedlings because high residential growth reduced light
   availability. Nutrient pulses can therefore have strong but opposing
   effects on invasibility, depending on when they coincide with particular
   life history stages of an invader. Indeed, in SBU-treated plots, small
   differences in height of transplanted seedlings early on produced large
   differences in their final biomass. All facilitative effects of
   small-scale disturbance on invasion success diminished when
   productivity-promoting factors were present, suggesting that disturbance
   patch size is important. Precipitation-induced invasion resistance of
   C-3 pastures by a C-4 invader was partly supported. In grazed
   grasslands, these biotic and environmental factors vary across scales
   and interact in complex ways to affect invasibility, thus a dynamic
   patch mosaic of differential invasion resistance likely occurs in single
   fields. We propose that disturbance patch size, grazing intensity, soil
   resource availability, and resident composition are inextricably linked
   to grassland invasions and comment on the utility of community
   attributes as reliable predictors of invasibility. Lastly, we suggest
   temporal as well as spatial coincidences of multiple invasion
   facilitators dictate the window of opportunity for invasion.}},

Volume = {{66}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted in the and Mediterranean Reserve located in
   northern Jordan, representing a continuous grazed and rangeland
   ecosystem. Quantitative analyses on species diversity in addition to
   phytogeographical analysis were conducted. Some ecological parameters
   such as, life forms, growth forms, species density and frequency were
   investigated. A total of 93 vascular plant taxa belonging to 78 genera
   and 26 families were reported. This constitutes about 4.3\% of the total
   flora of Jordan. Reported taxa include 13 species of grasses, 69 forbs
   and 10 shrubs and semi-shrubs. The botanical survey pointed to the
   presence of four rare species in Jordan. Plant species were classified
   into 28 functional groups. Pairwise correlation analyses among the most
   abundant species, showed that neutral associations dominated (75\%)
   those communities, followed by positive associations (19\%), while only
   (6\%) showed negative association. Positive association may be
   attributed to direct facultative mutualism, or to physical environmental
   heterogeneity. Such a positive cooperation in the plant community can
   significantly maintain species diversity in adverse environments.
   The relationship between primary productivity and species richness
   showed a humpbacked pattern. Maximum richness corresponded to a biomass
   level of 300-400 g m(-2). However, a sinusoidal curve-fitting model
   explained the relationship between graminoids biomass and species
   richness. These findings pointed to the adaptation of plant taxa to
   livestock grazing and to the small-scale spatial and environmental
   heterogeneity in and Middle Eastern Mediterranean rangelands. Results
   suggest that optimal biodiversity conservation for the and Middle
   Eastern grazing lands should consider their high level of spatial
   heterogeneity. Rangeland managers should adopt grazing plans that apply
   a range of grazing pressure across the area so as to maintain diversity
   at local and regional scales. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{1 There is increasing evidence that components of biodiversity affect
   processes at the ecosystem level; yet, the effects of biodiversity on
   the performance of individual organisms or particular trophic
   interactions are largely unexplored.
   2 We transplanted 10 individuals of Rumex acetosa into 82 experimental
   grassland plots differing in plant species and functional group
   richness. Half of the plants received an insecticide treatment to
   manipulate insect herbivory.
   3 We measured the amount of herbivory, plant size, survival and
   reproductive parameters in 2003 and 2004.
   4 Insect herbivores removed on average 4.3\% (2003) and 5.1\% (2004) of
   leaf area in unsprayed plants. Spraying significantly reduced damage
   levels on average by approximately 50\%. Herbivory significantly
   decreased plant weight, leaf size and number, and inflorescence length
   and size.
   5 Plant height and inflorescence size of R. acetosa significantly
   decreased with an increase in species diversity. Mortality was slightly
   higher in the species-poor mixtures. Plant functional group diversity
   had little effect on plant performance. The presence of legumes
   generally increased, while the presence of grasses generally decreased,
   morphological parameters and fitness in R. acetosa.
   6 Overall, the presence of particular plant functional groups was more
   important than functional group or species richness per se, and insect
   herbivores had additive effects of the same magnitude as the presence of
   particular plant functional groups.
   7 Insect herbivory and plant functional identity, rather than species
   richness, determine the performance of individual plant species in
   temperate grasslands.}},

Journal = {{WETLANDS}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{667-676}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Establishing species-rich plant communities is a common goal of habitat
   restoration efforts, but not all species within a target assemblage have
   the same capacity for recruitment and survival in created habitats. We
   investigated the development of a tidal salt marsh plant community in
   the presence of a rapidly colonizing dominant species, Salicornia
   virginica, in a newly created habitat in Mugu Lagoon, California, USA.
   We planted rooted cuttings of S. virginica, Distichlis spicata, Jaumea
   carnosa, and Frankenia salina in single- and mixed-species stands, where
   each species was planted alone or in combination with S. virginica in 4
   m 2 plots. We measured species percent cover, recruit density, canopy
   structure, and aboveground biomass after three growing seasons. When
   planted alone, S. virginica achieved the greatest cover, up to 70\%,
   followed by J. carnosa (55\%), F salina (35\%), and D. spicata (12\%).
   Total percent cover was about 30\% lower than in a reference site. For
   each species, average percent cover and aboveground biomass per plant
   were generally similar between single-species and mixed planting
   treatments, suggesting that on the time scale of this study, competition
   between species was weak. Canopy structure (height, number of layers)
   and total aboveground biomass of all species were largely unaffected by
   planting treatments, although S. virginica was shorter when planted with
   J. carnosa. Salicornia virginica recruits constituted approximately 98\%
   of the cover of seedling recruits into the created site. Despite intense
   S. virginica recruitment, our intervention in the successional process
   by planting species with poorer colonization abilities, particularly J
   carnosa and F. salina, prevented S. virginica from completely dominating
   the canopy, thus increasing vascular plant richness in the created site.
   Artificially increased richness may enhance some ecosystem functions and
   create a seed source to facilitate the persistence of a diverse plant
   assemblage in restored sites.}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{29}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally managed mountain grasslands in the Alps are species-rich
   ecosystems that developed during centuries of livestock grazing.
   However, changes in land use including fertilisation of well accessible
   pastures and gradual abandonment of remote sites are increasingly
   threatening this diversity. In five regions of the Swiss and French Alps
   we assessed the relationship between land use, soil resource
   availability, cover of the unpalatable species Veratrum album, species
   richness and vegetation composition of mountain grasslands across four
   spatial scales ranging from I to 1000 in 2.
   Mean species richness and the increase in the number of species with
   increasing area were lower in intensively grazed, fertilised pastures
   than in traditional pastures or in abandoned pastures. Species
   composition of abandoned pastures differed from that of the other
   management types. Plant species richness was influenced by different
   factors at different spatial scales. At the I in 2 scale, plant species
   richness was negatively related to soil nitrate and influenced by the
   cover of V album, depending on land use: species richness and cover of V
   album were negatively correlated in abandoned pastures, but positively
   correlated in fertilised grasslands. At the 1000 in 2 scale, a negative
   effect of fertilization on richness was evident. These results indicate
   that at small scales species richness in mountain grasslands is
   determined by competition for light, which should be more important if
   nutrient availability is high, and by positive and negative interactions
   with unpalatable plants. In contrast, species richness at the large
   scale appears to be mainly influenced by land use. This result
   emphasizes the importance of studying such inter-relationships at
   multiple scales. Our study further suggests that the maintenance of the
   traditional land use scheme is crucial for the conservation of plant
   species richness of mountain pastures as both intensification and
   abandonment changed species composition and reduced plant species
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{To elucidate the factors that affect the performance of plants in their
   natural environment, it is essential to study interactions with other
   neighboring plants, as well as with above- and belowground higher
   trophic organisms. We used a long-term field experiment to study how
   local plant community diversity influenced colonization by the biennial
   composite Senecio jacobaea in its native range in The Netherlands in
   Europe. We tested the effect of sowing later-succession plant species (
   0, 4, or 15 species) on plant succession and S. jacobaea performance.
   Over a period of eight years, the percent cover of S. jacobaea was
   relatively low in communities sown with 15 or 4 later-succession plant
   species compared to plots that were not sown, but that were colonized
   naturally. However, after four years of high abundance, the density of
   S. jacobaea in unsown plots started to decline, and the size of the
   individual plants was smaller than in the plots sown with 15 or 4 plant
   species. In the unsown plots, densities of aboveground leaf-mining,
   flower-feeding, and stem-boring insects on S. jacobaea plants were lower
   than on plants in sown plots, and there was a strong positive
   relationship between plant size and levels of herbivory.
   In a greenhouse experiment, we grew S. jacobaea in sterilized soil
   inoculated with soil from the different sowing treatments of the field
   experiment. Biomass production was lower when S. jacobaea test plants
   were grown in soil from the unsown plots than in soil from the sown
   plots ( 4 or 15 species). Molecular analysis of the fungal and bacterial
   communities revealed that the composition of fungal communities in
   unsown plots differed significantly from those in sown plots, suggesting
   that soil fungi could have been involved in the relative growth
   reduction of S. jacobaea in the greenhouse bioassay. Our results show
   that, in its native habitat, the abundance of S. jacobaea depends on the
   initial composition of the plant community and that, on a scale of
   almost a decade, its interactions with plant and soil communities and
   aboveground invertebrates may influence the dynamics of this colonizing
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneity in species assemblages of carabid beetles was studied
   between regenerating larch plantations of different forest ages and
   natural deciduous broad-leaved forests in Southwestern China. Larch
   plantations that were dominated by the non-native tree species (Larix
   kaempferi) interspersed with a small proportion of native tree species
   (L. mastersian) were established after the clear-cutting of the natural
   deciduous broad-leaved forests. Using pitfall traps, we compared the
   distribution of carabid beetles in recently planted (5 years old), young
   (15 years old), mature plantation (45 years old) and adjacent natural
   deciduous broad-leaved forests (ca. 100 years old). Four replicated
   plots for each plantation and five replicated transects in natural
   broad-leaved forest were chosen, and each plot or transect was
   investigated with four trap locations twice each month during the
   growing season (May-October) in 2004. Our results showed that species
   richness, abundance and Shannon diversity were significantly higher in
   the natural forest than in the regenerating plantations. In addition,
   these indices were not significantly different in 15- and 45-year-old
   plantations but were higher than those in 5-year-old plantation.
   Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) ordination grouped the carabid
   assemblages according to forest type and forest age, suggesting that
   there is a general pattern of recovery after logging. Moreover,
   indicator species analysis detected significant species associated with
   forest types and ages. Based on the specificity and fidelity, carabids
   can be distinguished into six species groups: habitat generalists,
   generalists in forests with closed canopy, specialists in natural
   broad-leaved forest, generalists in plantations with closed canopy,
   young closed canopy larch plantation-associated species and open canopy
   larch plantation-associated species. Multiple linear regression showed
   that the depth of leaf litter, the cover of canopy and shrub layer had
   significant effects in determining richness, abundance and diversity of
   carabid beetles. Therefore, the regenerating larch plantations, even
   mature plantations, could not replace the role of the natural deciduous
   broad-leaved forests in sustaining the diversity of carabid assemblages.
   Furthermore, establishments of large areas of relatively homogeneous
   larch plantations may have detrimental long-term effects on the
   composition and structure of carabid assemblages. Thus, it is important
   for us to understand the subtle variations in habitat and take
   appropriate actions for maintaining the invertebrate diversity before
   the logging of natural forests and establishments of plantations. (c)

Title = {{Forest conversion and land use change in rural northwest Yunnan, China -
   A fine-scale analysis in the context of the `big picture'}},
Journal = {{MOUNTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Contrary to the trend of rapid deforestation continuing across Asia,
   regional assessments point to recent increases in forest cover in China,
   including Yunnan Province, since the implementation of dramatic forestry
   policy changes. There is debate about whether the statistics that
   describe increasing forest cover adequately account for forest status
   and quality. In this context, the present article aims to quantify
   forest cover and land use changes in a Tibetan-dominated rural township
   in northwest Yunnan, China-an ecologically important region affected by
   recent forest policy changes. Three sequences of Landsat satellite
   imagery dating from 1981 to late 1999 and other digital datasets were
   used in a rules-based hybrid classification approach, achieving
   acceptable accuracy assessment scores.
   The results show an average aggregate decline in conifer forests of
   23\%, mostly due to an active logging industry. Much of this forest has
   converted to shrubland, which increased in area by over 100\%. Grassland
   also increased, mainly at the expense of cultivation, as a response to
   increasing dependence on livestock by the rural communities, although
   high elevation rangelands decreased in area due to changing livelihoods
   and restrictions by the government on grazing and deliberate burning.
   Using the accepted definitions of forest and shrubland categories, it
   was difficult to depict forest and shrubland dynamics due to variation
   in forest regeneration and afforestation, dieback-affected forests,
   secondary succession of disused rangelands, and a variety of other mixed
   community types. Conversion analysis revealed significant
   forest-shrubland exchanges occurring even during the 1990s when
   reduction in overall forest cover slowed considerably. The results
   support the view that the standard categorizations and representations
   of land cover only portray a partial picture of forest status, as they
   do not account for multiple conversions that occur between different
   land covers over time. Due to ongoing forestry programs and increasing
   utilization of forest resources by local communities, these conversion
   issues may be significant, with implications for forest quality and
   biodiversity.
   Our understanding of China's forest status will be improved by
   correlating inventory data with finer-scale spatial datasets to enable
   conversion analysis in representative ecological regions. This will
   advance our knowledge of China's forest status and the effectiveness of
   forest policy for both local rural community needs, as well as for
   broader ecological conservation.}},

Pages = {{394-405}},

Abstract = {{The effects of grazing on the richness of understorey plant communities
   are predicted to vary along gradients of resources and tree cover. In
   temperate Australia livestock management has involved phosphorus
   addition and tree removal but little research has examined how the
   effects of grazing on plant species richness may vary with these
   management regimes. Patterns of understorey plant species richness were
   examined in 519, 0.09 ha quadrats in grazed pastures and remnant grassy
   forests and woodlands in southern Australia. Sheep grazing was the
   primary land use and sites varied widely in grazing frequency and
   density, tree cover and phosphor-us fertiliser history Using an
   information theoretic approach the available data provides strong
   evidence that the effect of grazing on total species richness varies
   according to available phosphorus and tree cover. Intermittent grazing
   and no grazing were associated with high total and native plant
   richness, but only at low phosphorus concentrations. Phosphorus was
   strongly negatively correlated with richness, particularly at low
   grazing frequency. Total species richness was positively correlated with
   tree cover except under frequent grazing at high stocking rates,
   suggesting that heavy grazing eliminates spatial and temporal
   heterogeneity imposed by trees. Native plant species richness was
   negatively correlated with a history of cultivation, positively
   correlated with tree cover and varied according to landscape position
   and geological substrate. Frequent high density grazing, particularly
   when associated with clearing, cultivation and fertiliser addition, was
   associated with the persistence of very few native plant species. In
   contrast, the richness of exotic plant species was relatively invariant
   and performance of the best model was low. While several studies have
   highlighted the importance of the grazed and cleared matrix for the
   conservation of native plant species, this benefit may be limited in
   landscapes where intensive grazing management systems dominate. Strong
   evidence for interactions between grazing, phosphorus and tree cover
   suggest that failure to consider other land use practices associated
   with grazing management systems could lead to erroneous conclusions
   regarding vegetation responses to livestock grazing. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Socio-economically motivated land use changes are a major threat for
   species diversity of grasslands throughout the world. Here, we
   comprehensively explore how plant species diversity of grasslands in the
   species-rich cultural landscape of the Swiss Alps depends on recent land
   use changes, and, neglected in previous studies, on old cultural
   traditions. We studied diversity in 216 grassland parcels at three
   altitudinal levels in 12 villages of three cultural traditions (Romanic,
   Germanic, and Walser). In valleys of Romanic villages more different
   parcel types tended to occur than in those of Germanic and Walser
   villages, suggesting that socio-economic differences among cultural
   traditions still play a role in shaping landscape diversity. Moreover,
   at the village level, higher man-made landscape diversity was associated
   with higher plant species richness. All observed changes in land use
   reduced the farmers' workload. Plant species richness was lower in
   fertilized than in unfertilized parcels and in abandoned compared with
   used parcels. Grazing slightly reduced species richness compared with
   mowing among unfertilized parcels, while in fertilized parcels it had a
   positive influence. The highest species diversity was found in mown
   unfertilized subalpine grasslands. Nevertheless, moderate grazing of
   former meadows can be a valuable alternative to abandonment. We conclude
   that the ongoing changes in land use reduce plant species richness
   within parcels and at the landscape level. To preserve plant species
   diversity at the landscape level a high diversity of land use types has
   to be maintained. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Research suggests that prairie dogs play a keystone role in grassland
   ecosystems. We examined the relationship between black-tailed prairie
   dogs (Cynomys hudovicianus) and herptiles and small mammals in eastern
   Colorado. Using pitfall traps, funnel traps, and ground captures, we
   captured a total of 152 herptiles representing 10 species. Captures of
   herptiles and small mammals varied with annual precipitation. As
   predicted, we captured some species more frequently on colonies and
   others more commonly off colonies. Bullsnakes (Pituophis catenifer) and
   prairie rattlesnakes (Crotalits v. viridis) comprised 49\% of herptiles
   captured, with significantly more rattlesnakes captured on colonies, but
   more bullsnakes (not significant) off colonies. We found similar
   herptile species richness and both Shannon-Wiener and evenness diversity
   indices on colonies and off-colony sites, but slightly higher diversity
   when calculated across the two habitat types. We inadvertently caught
   134 mammals in traps; 59\% on colonies and 41\% on off-colony sites.
   Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) represented the most frequent mammal
   caught. Captures of desert cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus auditbonii)
   were significantly higher on colonies. Higher species richness and
   diversity of small mammals was associated with colonies. These results
   support our hypothesis that the presence of prairie dogs increases
   diversity between habitats or ecosystems (i.e. beta diversity) on
   grasslands they inhabit. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{1 The Park Grass Experiment, begun in 1856, is the oldest ecological
   experiment in existence. Its value to science has changed and grown
   since it was founded to answer agricultural questions. In recent times
   the experiment has shown inter alia how: plant species richness, biomass
   and pH are related; community composition responds to climatic
   perturbation and nutrient additions; soil is acidified and corrected by
   liming. It also provided one of the first demonstrations of the
   evolution of adaptation at a very local scale and contains a putative
   case of the evolution of reproductive isolation by reinforcement. The
   application of molecular genetic markers to archived plant material
   promises to reveal a whole new chapter of genetic detail about the
   long-term dynamics of plant populations.
   2 Over the range of values observed at Park Grass, biomass
   (productivity) has a negative effect upon species richness. Any positive
   effect of species richness on productivity could only be weak by
   comparison. The experiment provides support for both the competitive
   exclusion and pool size hypotheses for determination of species density.
   3 Instantaneous comparisons of species richness between plots do not
   accurately reflect temporal rates of loss which may be multiplicative
   rather than additive. This suggests that comparisons among sites,
   nutrient inputs, especially N treatments, or soil acidity may in general
   underestimate the threat posed to plant species diversity by long-term
   changes in plant nutrient availability, both enrichment and depletion.
   4 Differences between plots at the community level are maintained
   despite a flow of propagules between plots. There is no strong evidence
   for a spatial mass effect.
   5 Guild (grass/legume/other) compositions of plant communities have
   equilibrated, but the species composition within guilds is more dynamic
   and continues to change over time, suggesting that species and guild
   abundances are independently regulated.
   6 At least some members of all the major trophic levels, including
   predators (spiders), herbivores (leafhoppers) and detritivores
   (springtails) are treatment-specific in their distributions.
   7 Plant populations on Park Grass are subdivided by treatments which, to
   some degree, have led to plots becoming genetically isolated from one
   another and decoupled demographically. This subdivision has created a
   metapopulation structure in each species, characterized by
   species-specific rates of local colonization and extinction.
   8 Inverse clines in flowering time occur in the grass Anthoxanthum
   odoratum across some plot boundaries. These suggest that reproductive
   isolation between plots has been reinforced by natural selection.
   9 Drift as well as selection may have taken place in A. odoratum,
   especially on plots where effective population size is restricted by
   population bottlenecks caused by drought.
   10 Park Grass illustrates how long-term experiments grow in value with
   time and how they may be used to investigate scientific questions that
   were inconceivable at their inception. This is as likely to be true of
   the future of Park Grass as it has proved to be of its past.}},

Abstract = {{135 infrageneric taxa of epiphytic lichen were found in 20 stands of

   were considered: (1) late successional stands with several large trees,
   (2) pioneer stands on abandoned pastures without large trees, and (3)
   open and grazed stands. They were compared on the basis of four main
   criteria: (1) species richness, (2) number of rare species, (3) number
   of species that are exclusive to the subalpine belt in Italy, and (4)
   number of species that are exclusive to the Alps in Italy. Species
   richness is higher in the late successional stands, which also host a
   higher share of rare and exclusive species. The total number of rare
   species per site is correlated with the total number of species, as well
   as with the number of common species, and with the total number of
   macrolichens. Rare macrolichens are correlated with common macrolichens.
   Two main groups of target species with decreasing conservation priority
   are identified. Letharia vulpina is suggested as signal species for
   sites worthy of conservation. The guild of macrolichens may be used as
   an indicator of both species richness and of the occurrence of rare

Abstract = {{We examined effects of abandonment on species diversity and species
   composition by comparing 21 calcareous fen meadows in the pre-alpine
   zone of central and northeastern Switzerland. Meadows were divided into
   three classes of successional stages (mown: annually mown in late
   summer, young fallow: 4-15 years, and old fallow: > 15 years of
   abandonment). In each fen, we measured litter mass in four 20 cm x 20 cm
   plots, as well as (aboveground) biomass and species density (number of
   species per unit area) of bryophytes and vascular plants. Bryophyte
   biomass was reduced in abandoned fens, whereas litter mass and
   aboveground biomass of vascular plants increased. Species density of
   both taxonomic groups was lower in abandoned than in mown fens. Young
   and old successional stages were not different except for bryophytes,
   for which old successional stages had higher species density than young
   stages. We used litter mass and aboveground biomass of vascular plants
   as covariables in analyses of variance to reveal their effects on
   species density of both taxonomic groups. For bryophytes, litter mass
   was more important than vascular plant biomass in explaining variance of
   species density. This indicates severe effects of burying by litter on
   bryophyte species density. For species density of vascular plants, both
   vascular plant biomass and litter mass were of similar importance in
   explaining the decreased species density. Canonical correspondence
   analyses showed that abandonment also had an effect on species
   composition of both bryophytes and vascular plants. However, young and
   old successional stages were not different indicating fast initial
   changes after abandonment, but slow secondary succession afterwards.
   Furthermore, indicator species analysis showed that there was no
   establishment of new species after abandonment that might dramatically
   alter fen communities. Re-introduction of mowing as a nature
   conservation strategy may thus be very promising - even for old fallows.}},

Abstract = {{SOUTH AFRICA'S NEW BIODIVERSITY ACT requires the development of a
   national framework for the integrated management of biodiversity in the
   country. The act also requires regular monitoring and reporting of the
   status of biodiversity. We apply a new approach, the Biodiversity
   Intactness Index (BII), to assess the state of biodiversity in South
   Africa. The index is a measure of the change in abundance across all
   well-known elements of biodiversity, relative to their inferred
   pre-colonial state. The BII can be calculated nationally, by province,
   municipality or ecosystem type, or any other defined spatial unit. We
   estimate that, averaged across plants, mammals, birds, reptiles and
   frogs, abundances have declined by 19 +/- 7\% over the past three
   centuries in South Africa. Losses are greatest in the grassland, fynbos
   and forest biomes, and mammals are the most affected taxonomic group. It
   is estimated that 80\% of the remaining wild organisms in South Africa
   are in the extensive areas predominantly under grazing management. This
   suggests that the policy action with the greatest potential to limit
   further loss of biodiversity is to prevent the degradation of these

Abstract = {{Wetlands are dvnamic habitats with many unique, important functions
   including filtering sediments and providing diverse habitats for fish
   and wildlife. Wetlands in the western United States are particularly
   important because they offer habitat for a number of protected runs of
   endangered fish species. Historically, livestock grazing has altered
   wetland and riparian area form and function by facilitating exotic
   species invasions, altering spatial heterogeneity of vegetation, and
   increasing erosion. In this study we examined vegetation structure and
   erosion potential in a wetland meadow exposed to unregulated grazing
   along Deer Creek in the Salmon River subbasin, Idaho. We characterized
   the vegetation composition and structure within the study area and
   attempted to assess potential erosion conditions using the Revised
   Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), an empirical approach developed by
   the U.S. Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service
   (USDA-ARS). We found Do significant spatial variability in species
   richness and noted a moderate number of exotic species in the total
   plant composition. Plant cover was higher near slightly entrenched
   banks, indicating that uncontrolled livestock were primarily occupying
   gently sloped streambanks and the interior of the meadow. Based on
   current vegetation composition and RUSLE results, uncontrolled grazing
   may be negatively impacting the study area. If uncontrolled grazing were
   excluded or carefully managed in the wetland meadows of the upper
   portion of the Deer Creek watershed, a reduction in excess sediments to
   Deer Creek may occur.}},

Abstract = {{Sampling of soil seed banks is known to be methodologically difficult,
   as diaspore distribution in soil is often patchy. Especially rare plant
   species are inherently difficult to detect. In our study we validated
   the accuracy of a sampling method which is based on a high number of
   individual sample units (100 soil cores/plot, altogether 12 plots)
   gathered by means of a random-systematic sampling design. We used this
   method in the course of a case study on successional stages of
   endangered inland sand vegetation in two areas of Germany. We analysed
   seed bank composition, proportion of endangered species, similarity
   between seed bank and aboveground vegetation and grazing impact.
   (1) Methodological approach. The method produced results with high
   representativeness. On average, about 78\% (topsoil: 1-6 cm depth) and
   72\% (subsoil: 11-16 cm) of the species (jackknife estimator) were
   detected. The mean SORENSEN distance between l9 and 10 composite samples
   (each consisting of 10 soil cores) was low (< 0.05 topsoil, < 0.1
   subsoil). Ordination of the topsoil samples revealed a high degree of
   homogeneity of the composite samples.
   (2) Case study. The soil seed banks of mid-successional stages
   (Diantho-Armerietum, Armerio-Festucetum) were significantly richer in
   species and diaspores than the associated pioneer stages
   (Spergulo-Corynephoretum, Koelerion glaucae). The seed banks of the
   base-rich successional series were significantly richer in plant species
   (parallel to aboveground vegetation) as well as in diaspores than the

   found in very low densities (e. g. Corynephorus canescens) in the soils
   of mid-successional stages or were not found in these stages (e.g.

   Red List species were found in low abundances in the seed banks (< 50
   diaspores m(-2) in topsoil as well as in subsoil). Among the Red List
   species detected in the aboveground vegetation one of four species
   (25\%, acidic series) or seven of 12 species (58\%, basic series) were
   detected in the seed banks. A two-year period of extensive sheep grazing

Abstract = {{Fire frequency has significant effects on the biota of tallgrass
   prairie, including mammals, vascular plants and birds. Recent concern
   has been expressed that widespread annual burning, sometimes in
   combination with heavy livestock grazing, negatively impacts the biota
   of remaining prairie remnants. A common management recommendation,
   intended to address this problem, is to create a landscape with a mosaic
   of different burn regimes. Pitfall trapping was used to investigate the
   impacts of fire pattern on the diversity and species composition of
   ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) at Konza Prairie Biological
   Station in eastern Kansas, USA. Trapping was conducted over three
   seasons in landscape units burned on average every 1, 4, or 20 years,
   and in a fourth season across the available range of vegetative
   structure to assess the variability of the community within the study
   system. In the fifth season communities were also followed immediately
   after two fire events to detect within-season effects of fire and to
   study short-term patterns of post-disturbance community assembly. Fire
   frequency had comparatively minimal effects on ground beetle diversity
   measures, and most numerically common species were observed widely
   across habitat and management types. Fire frequency effects were
   manifested primarily in changes in abundance of common species.
   Colonization of burned areas apparently did not occur from juxtaposed
   non-burned areas, but from underground or from long distances. While
   these results suggest that widespread annual burning of tallgrass
   prairie remnants may not have dramatic effects on prairie ground
   beetles, we urge caution regarding the application of these results to
   other taxa within tallgrass prairie.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of insectivorous farmland passerines has been attributed
   mostly to global decrease in arthropod availability, as a result of
   intensification of agricultural practices. The diminution of the Alpine
   Whinchat, once a widespread insectivorous passerine, has been ascribed
   to nest losses due to earlier and more frequent mowings. However,
   potential conjugated effects of deteriorated arthropod food availability
   had yet to be investigated. We compared food supply and nestling diet in
   intensively vs. traditionally managed grassland. Abundance and diversity
   of arthropods were much lower in intensive areas, where small-sized
   invertebrates, which do not enter nestling diet, were also predominant.
   Parents breeding in intensive habitats fed less biomass to nestlings
   than adults from traditional habitats. Nestling diet was less diverse
   and dominated by less profitable prey items in intensive than in
   traditional habitats. Feeding rate did not differ between the two
   habitats, but foraging distances from nest tended to be greater in
   intensive farmland. There were no significant differences in clutch
   sizes and hatching success with respect to management intensity, but
   fledging success was higher in traditional habitats. The recent
   intensification of farming practices has led to a decrease in the
   availability of grassland invertebrates, and of important Whinchat
   nestling food in particular, affecting parents' foraging efficiency and
   reproductive success. Conservation actions must not only reduce nest
   losses by postponing mowing, but should also promote grassland farming
   that is less detrimental to invertebrates. Dominant at the study site,
   organic grassland farming does seemingly not provide sufficient
   conditions for Alpine Whinchats. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recent theoretical studies predict that body size-related interspecific
   differences in spatial scale of perception and resource use may
   contribute to coexistence of species that compete for the same class of
   resources. These studies provide a new theoretical framework for
   explaining resource partitioning patterns among African ungulates that
   coexist in spatially heterogeneous savanna grasslands. According to
   these studies, different-sized ungulates can coexist because larger
   species forage at a coarser scale but can tolerate lower quality food,
   whereas smaller species need higher quality food but forage at a finer
   scale. To test this hypothesis in an African savanna, we created an
   experimental mosaic with variation in grain ( spatial detail) and
   quality of short-grass patches and directly observed the visitation of
   naturally occurring grazers to this mosaic over a two-year period (
   total of 903 observation hours). Of the seven species that visited our
   experiment, warthog, impala, zebra, and white rhino visited long enough
   to allow data analysis. We showed that warthog and impala avoided plots
   with a finer grain of short grass and that warthog preferred fertilized
   plots to unfertilized plots. Zebra and white rhino did not avoid the
   finer grain plots. Our results suggest that differences in grain and
   quality of a resource might indeed contribute to partitioning of this
   resource by savanna ungulates. Although four focal species is unusually
   high for an experimental study on resource partitioning among naturally
   occurring savanna ungulates, this number is too low to evaluate the
   allometric basis of our hypothesis. Our results, however, encourage
   wider experimental testing of the role of spatial heterogeneity in
   facilitating the coexistence of potentially competing savanna
   herbivores.}},

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{The conservation of high-altitude medicinal plants is of concern
   throughout the Himalayan region, because they are important for
   traditional health care and in large-scale collection for trade. Because
   little is known regarding their conservation status in relation to the
   diversity of land-use patterns and habitats, this paper explores
   patterns of species composition and diversity of medicinal plants in
   five different pasture types in a traditionally-managed high-altitude
   landscape in northwest Nepal. Environmental variables, including human
   activities, strongly affected species composition, diversity and
   cover-abundance of medicinal plant species. Species richness of rare and
   commercially threatened medicinal plants (CTMP) showed patterns similar
   to overall medicinal plant species richness. Sub-alpine meadows, which
   have intermediate levels of human pressure related to grazing and
   relatively high levels of resource availability in terms of rainfall and
   soil nutrients, were richer in medicinal-plant species than alpine
   meadows. The coexistence of various plant communities under different
   human management regimes also enhanced landscape-level species diversity
   by maintaining some species restricted to particular habitat or pasture
   types. A number of medicinal plant species reported to be resistant to
   grazing were most abundant in heavily grazed sites. This pattern
   suggests that medicinal plant species may be positively influenced, to a
   certain extent, by human activities (mainly grazing). The combination of
   grazing and high levels of harvesting, however, had a negative impact on
   diversity and cover-abundance of rare and CTMP species. Maintenance of
   medicinal plant diversity and cover-abundance is critically dependent on
   managing grazing and resource harvesting to maintain levels that are
   both ecologically and economically sustainable. Forage for livestock and
   medicinal plants for local health care cannot be managed independently;
   a systems approach is needed, incorporating social management to
   accommodate the needs of different users. This could be achieved by
   maintenance of a mosaic landscape, in which different use patterns and
   pressures, reflecting the values attached to resources by different
   users and favouring different types of biodiversity, co-exist.}},

Abstract = {{The seminatural grasslands are some of the most species-rich biotopes in
   Sweden. The creation and maintenance of their biological and cultural
   values are dependent on continuous management. However, due to the
   diminishing number of grazing animals, there has been a substantial loss
   of seminatural grasslands during the last century. The paper discusses
   how the seminatural grasslands, their biodiversity and future use are
   linked to social aspects. One underlying aim has been to explore how
   geographical perspectives can help to bridge the gap between social and
   natural science in nature resource management research. Case studies,
   including interviews with farmers, have been carried out in four rural
   areas in Sweden. The local contexts are described by using components in
   Norgaard's structural frame of the integrated relation man-environment,
   co-evolution; environment, social organization, value systems and
   knowledge. The concept of resilience provides an analytical frame for
   discussing the conditions and prospects for the future management of
   seminatural grasslands. The result shows similarities between the areas
   as regards possible options and measures for the enhancement of
   seminatural grassland management. There are also significant
   differences, indicating the need for flexible landscape policies,
   allowing adaptive management in various local contexts. (C) 2006

Abstract = {{1. Habitat loss and degradation of wetland ecosystems, principally
   through large-scale drainage and conversion to arable farmland, have
   been implicated in the widespread, dramatic declines of breeding waders
   across Europe. Managing the remaining wetlands to reverse these declines
   will require a detailed understanding of their habitat requirements.
   2. In the UK, grazing marshes are key components of the remaining
   wetlands in both coastal and inland sites, and the structure of grazing
   marsh habitat can differ between these locations. Redshank Tringa
   totanus is a declining wader species that breeds in both marsh types. We
   quantified the habitat features that influence redshank selection of
   breeding and nest site locations, across coastal and inland marshes, in
   eastern England.
   3. On both marsh types, breeding location and breeding densities within
   fields were positively related to the lengths of pool edge and all wet
   features, respectively. Nest site location was principally influenced by
   vegetation characteristics, with soil penetrability also important on
   inland sites but proximity to wet features and vegetation type at the
   nest important on coastal sites. Hatching probability was higher when
   the surrounding soils were more penetrable.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The wet features of critical importance
   for breeding redshank are common on coastal marshes and can be
   deliberately established on inland sites. Coastal marshes are often rare
   and frequently threatened by dynamic coastal processes, whereas inland
   marshes are more abundant but largely unsuitable for breeding waders at
   present. These analyses highlight the scope for improving the management
   of inland marshes for breeding redshank. As habitat suitable for
   breeding redshank frequently supports a range of other wader species,
   this information can also direct management efforts to improve breeding
   wader populations in the wider countryside.}},

Abstract = {{The success of calcareous grassland recreation following abandonment
   depends to a large extent on the composition of the soil seed bank. We
   studied the species richness and composition of the seed bank along a
   chronosequence from well-developed calcareous grassland to scrub and
   forest vegetation, which had developed on calcareous grassland over the
   last 225 years. The seed bank density was highest in the calcareous
   grassland soils (930 seeds/m(2)). However, the seed bank was mainly
   composed of rather common species of nutrient poor grassland, which were
   poorly represented in the surface vegetation. There were no significant
   differences in soil seed bank density and species composition between
   the calcareous grassland and scrub vegetation that was less than 15
   years old, largely because several grassland species had persisted in
   the scrub vegetation and were therefore able to replenish the soil seed
   bank. In contrast seed density and species richness declined
   significantly after 40 years of grassland abandonment. Indeed, forest
   soils had the lowest seed densities (214 seeds/m(2)) with only a few
   grassland species represented. This reflects the lack of grassland
   species in the field layer of the forest, and, therefore, the lack of
   seed production and seed bank replenishment. It is clear that recreation
   of calcareous grassland on long abandoned sites cannot rely on
   germination of target species from the seed bank alone. Even in the
   calcareous grassland soil, seeds of target species are not abundant as
   the majority produces transient seeds, which decay rapidly if they do
   not germinate immediately. Successful grassland recreation on such sites
   therefore may require seeds of target species to be introduced
   artificially (e.g. as seed mixtures, green hay, etc.). Alternatively,
   reinstatement of traditional practices, such as grazing or mowing, will
   increase the natural dispersal potential of these species, allowing
   population reestablishment in the long term. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Question: What are the changes in vegetation structure, soil attributes
   and mesofauna associated with grazing in mesic grasslands?
   Location: Southern Campos of the Rio de la Plata grasslands, in
   south-central Uruguay.
   Methods: We surveyed seven continuously grazed and ungrazed paired
   plots. Plant and litter cover were recorded on three 5-m interception
   lines placed parallel to the fence in each plot. We extracted soil fauna
   from a 10 ern deep composite sample and analysed the oribatids. Soil
   attributes included bulk density, water content, organic carbon (in
   particulate and mineral associated organic matter) and nitrogen content
   and root biomass at different depths. Changes in floristic, Plant
   Functional Types and mesofauna composition were analysed by Non-metric
   Multidimensional Scaling.
   Results: Species number was lower in ungrazed than in grazed plots. Of
   105 species in grazed plots only three were exotics. Shrub and litter
   cover were significantly higher inside the exclosures, while the cover
   of Cyperaceae-Juncaceae was lower. Grazing treatments differed
   significantly in plant and oribatid species composition. Grazing
   exclusion significantly reduced soil bulk density and increased soil
   water content. Carbon content in particulate organic matter was lower in
   the upper soil of ungrazed sites, but deeper in the profile, grazing
   exclosures had 8\% more carbon in the mineral associated organic matter.
   Conclusions: Our results generally agree with previous studies but
   deviate from the results of previous analyses in (1) the increase of
   shrub cover in ungrazed sites; (2) the redistribution of the soil
   organic carbon in the profile and (3) the low invasibility of the
   prairies regardless of grazing regime.}},

Abstract = {{The decline in grasslands and other species-rich early successional
   habitats on the coastal sandplains of the northeastern United States has
   spurred management to increase the area of these declining plant
   communities. We mechanically removed overstory oak and applied seed from
   a nearby sandplain grassland on the island of Martha's Vineyard,
   Massachusetts, to evaluate this technique for creating an open oak
   community able to support sandplain herbaceous species. We compared
   vegetation structure and composition before and after clearing in an
   area of total tree removal (clearcutting), an area where 85\% of tree
   basal area was removed (savanna cutting), and in adjacent coastal oak
   forest. Plant responses to clearcutting and savanna cutting were
   similar. Sandplain herbs colonized at high frequencies after seeding and
   increased herbaceous cover from less than 7\% before clearing to 22-38\%
   three growing seasons later. Pennsylvania sedge (Carex pensylvanica)
   increased in cover approximately 6-fold, accounting for 84-90\% of the
   increased herbaceous cover. Other native ruderals and exotic herbs
   reached 2 and less than or equal to 1\%, cover, respectively, after
   three years. Species richness across cleared treatments increased from
   30 to 79 species. All forest species were retained. Forest shrubs and
   trees initially declined from their dominant cover but rebounded after
   three years. Tree clearing plus seeding appeared to be a viable
   management practice for increasing cover of herbaceous sandplain species
   while causing minimal increases in exotic herbaceous cover. The
   long-term persistence of sandplain herbs may require periodic
   disturbances that limit woody regrowth.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to assess land-use intensity and the
   related biodiversity in agricultural landscapes of the EU25 for the
   current situation (2000), and explore future trends, based on the four
   EURURALIS scenarios up to 2030.
   Data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) were used to classify
   farm types in 100 regions of the EU15, according to agricultural
   intensity. For the ten New Member States (EU10), which are not yet
   considered by the FADN, country level data were used to obtain similar
   farm types. Three processes were considered for the assessment of future
   trends in agricultural land-use intensity: (1) land-use change, (2)
   conversion into organic farming, and (3) changes in productivity of crop
   and grassland production.
   An ecosystem quality value was attributed to each farm type according to
   dose-effect relationships between pressure factors and biodiversity
   compared to the value for an undisturbed situation. The biodiversity in
   agricultural landscapes was then calculated as the average ecosystem
   quality multiplied by the relative area size of each farm type within a
   region. A similar method of attributing ecosystem quality values to
   other land-use types allowed comparison between different land-use
   types.
   Referring to the current situation, results indicate the lowest
   ecosystem quality values to be found in intensively used agricultural
   areas in lowlands (e.g. The Netherlands and northern France) and
   irrigation systems (e.g. Greece), whereas relatively high values are
   found in Spain and the New EU Member States. Scenario results show that
   for the A1 scenario (Global economy), the highest loss in ecosystem
   quality will take place in all regions in croplands and grasslands. The
   B2 scenario (Regional communities) provides the best opportunities to
   improve ecosystem quality of agricultural landscapes. In most scenarios,
   agricultural land is decreasing, while the remaining agricultural areas
   tend to be used more intensively. The negative impact of intensification
   on biodiversity is partly set off by (active or spontaneous) nature
   development on abandoned agricultural areas, but the overall trend seems
   to be generally negative.
   The strength of this methodology is that it provides a quick overview of
   land-use intensity change and biodiversity trends. Through the use of
   this farm-type level of analysis we have provided a good picture of the
   differences in land-use intensity and the related biodiversity between
   the EU regions and the scenarios. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{So far, the promotion of organic farming through additional premiums, as
   well as the coupling of direct payments with environmental standards for
   all agricultural enterprises (cross-compliance), has not been based on
   scientifically based indicator values. It is proposed that this should
   be done by means of a cost-benefit-analysis, taking into account both
   economic and environmental criteria. Economic incentives for conversion
   to organic fanning and environmentally sound fanning practices should be
   highest in regions where conventional intensive agriculture causes
   significant environmental damage without providing significantly higher
   yield levels than organic farming. In contrast, incentives for
   conversion should be lower in areas which are not environmentally
   sensitive, but promote significantly higher yield levels under
   conventional than under organic fanning practices.
   The protection of biotic resources has already been incorporated into
   the regional planning targets in some German federal states
   ({''}Priority areas for nature protection{''}). Extending this concept
   to the agricultural sector, ``priority areas for organic farming{''} can
   be formulated which aim primarily at the protection of abiotic
   resources.
   The application of this concept has been demonstrated by linking
   scientific data from test farms under different soil, climatic and
   management conditions with statistical data on soil fertility, livestock
   density and land use within the entire state. It could be demonstrated
   that a conversion of specialized dairy farms on sandy soils from highly
   intensive conventional practices to organic standards significantly
   reduced nitrate inputs into groundwater with only a slight reduction in
   forage yields. In contrast, nitrate leaching in both conventional and
   organic arable farming was low on loamy soils which are predestined for
   arable crop production. but grain yields were by far lower in organic
   farming.}},

Abstract = {{Farmland bird declines in Europe are well documented. In the UK,
   agri-environment schemes are key mechanisms for reversing the declines
   of birds and other farmland biodiversity, but recent reviews suggest
   that wet habitats might be a gap in provision by these schemes.
   Important resources provided by wet habitats include: (i) damp soil, for
   probing species; (ii) permanent water to provide water-dependent
   invertebrates, as a source of food; (iii) bare or sparsely vegetated
   ground in the draw-down zone, to improve access to food; (iv) rank
   emergent vegetation for nesting. However, wet habitats have been lost
   from farmland as a result of loss of ponds and filling of ditches, as
   well as the effective removal of water from fields by surface run-off,
   itself affected by soil compaction, and extensive under-field drainage.
   The efficient removal of water from fields can cause problems
   downstream, both through flooding, and diffuse pollution. Regular
   farmland pollutants include pesticides, nitrogen, phosphor-us and
   sediment, leading to environmental problems such as eutrophication and
   reduced quality of drinking water. Major new political instruments, such
   as the Water Framework Directive, will aim to reduce the impact of this
   diffuse pollution from agriculture. A variety of solutions to diffuse
   pollution, such as conservation tillage, buffer strips at field edges,
   and small constructed wetlands, could simultaneously provide some of the
   resources required by farmland birds. We suggest that future
   agri-environment schemes, to be truly multifunctional, could focus on
   bringing these diverse objectives together. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{It is hard to defend the view that biotic communities represent a simple
   and predictable response to the abiotic environment. Biota and the
   abiotic environment interact, and the environment of an individual
   certainly includes its neighbors and visitors in the community. The
   complexity of community assembly calls forth a quest for general
   principles, yet current results and theories on assembly rules differ
   widely.
   Using a grassland microcosm as a model system, we manipulated fertility,
   disturbance by defoliation, soil/microclimate, and arrival order of
   species belonging to two groups differing in functional attributes. We
   analyzed the Outcome of community assembly dynamics in terms of species
   richness, invasibility, and species composition. The analyses revealed
   strong environmental control over species richness and invasibility.
   Species composition was mainly determined by the arrival order of
   species, indicating that historical contingency may change the outcome
   of community assembly. The probability for multiple equilibria appeared
   to increase with productivity and environmental stability. The
   importance of arrival order offers an explanation of the difficulties in
   predicting local occurrences of species in the field.
   In our experiment, variation in fertility and disturbance was
   controlling colonization with predictable effects on emergent community
   properties such as species richness. The key mechanism is suggested to
   be asymmetric competition, and our results show that this mechanism is
   relatively insensitive to the species through which it works. While our
   analyses indicate a positive and significant correlation between
   richness and invasibility, the significance disappears after accounting
   for the effect of the environment.
   The importance of arrival order (historical contingency) and
   environmental control supports the assumption of the unified neutral
   theory that different species within a trophic level can be considered
   functionally equivalent when it comes to community assembly. However,
   our results indicate that variation in asymmetric competition is the key
   factor determining the richness of the resulting communities, and this
   is far from neutral.}},

Abstract = {{The current land use system in the anthropogenic savannas (Espinales) of
   the Mediterranean climate region of Chile, has resulted in considerable
   heterogeneity at the landscape level which is associated with different
   covers of the legume tree, Acacia caven. The effects of landscape
   heterogeneity on the diversity and productivity of herbaceous plant
   communities were studied in 29 plots of 1000 m(2), with a wide range of
   woody cover. A detrended correspondence analysis of the species x plots
   matrix explained 73\% of the total variation and revealed the existence
   of two trends of variation in floristic composition: one associated with
   physiographic position (hillsides and flatlands) and the other related
   to the number of years since the last cutting, or coppicing, of A.
   caven. Despite the great majority of the original herbaceous species
   having disappeared as a result of the prevailing land use system, some
   native species have been able to survive especially on hillside areas
   with low grazing intensity. Woody cover was a good indicator of spatial
   heterogeneity and land use history. It was also correlated with stocking
   rate, above-ground biomass of herbaceous vegetation, and soil fertility
   (organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration), both on
   hillsides and flatlands. The relationship between woody cover and
   herbaceous plant species richness was significant and unimodal in flat
   land areas, and linear, and marginally significant, on hillsides. The
   consequences of land use changes on the conservation of the ecological
   and productive values of grasslands are analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation is one of the most important threats to
   biodiversity. Decreasing patch size may lead to a reduction in the size
   of populations and to an increased extinction risk of remnant
   populations. Furthermore, colonization rates may be reduced in isolated
   patches. To investigate the effects of isolation and patch size on
   extinction and colonization rates of plant species, calcareous
   grasslands at three sites in the Swiss Jura Mountains were
   experimentally fragmented into patches of 0.25, 2.25, and 20.25 m(2) by
   frequent mowing of the surrounding area from 1993 to 1999. Species
   richness in the fragment plots and adjacent control plots of the same
   sizes was recorded during these 7 years. In agreement with the theory of
   island biogeography, colonization rate was reduced by 30\% in fragments
   versus non-isolated controls, and extinction increased in small versus
   large plots. Habitat specialists, in contrast to generalists, were less
   likely to invade fragments. In the last 4 years of the experiment,
   extinction rates tended to be higher in fragment than in control plots
   at two of the three sites. Despite reduced colonization rates and a
   tendency of increased extinction rates in fragments, fragmented plots
   had only marginally fewer species than control plots after 7 years.
   Hence, rates were a more sensitive measure for community change than
   changes in species richness per se. From a conservation point of view,
   the detected reduced colonization rates are particularly problematic in
   small fragments, which are more likely to suffer from high extinction
   rates in the long run.}},

Abstract = {{Grime's (1998) ``mass-ratio{''} hypothesis holds that ecosystem
   processes depend in the short term on functional properties of dominant
   plants and in the longer term on how resident species influence the
   recruitment of dominants. The latter of these effects may be especially
   important among early-successional species in disturbed ecosystems, but
   experimental tests are few. We removed two groups of early-successional
   species, an annual forb Gutierrezia dracunculoides (DC.) S. F. Blake and
   annual species (mostly grasses) that complete growth early in the
   growing season {[}early-season (ES) species], from a heavily-grazed
   grassland in central Texas, USA dominated by a C-4 perennial grass. We
   sought to determine effects of annuals on grassland functioning
   {[}productivity, water balance, soil and plant nitrogen (N)] and
   composition. Removals did not impact N retention in the soil/plant
   system during the two years of this study, but removing ES annuals
   increased the amount of water between 30 and 120 cm in the soil profile
   early in each growing season. Production and N accumulation by
   vegetation declined following the removal of ES annuals in approximate
   proportion to the contribution of annuals to aboveground biomass and N,
   consistent with the mass-ratio hypothesis. By the second year,
   production and N uptake by initially sub-dominant species increased to
   fully compensate for the loss of annuals. These results are consistent
   with the view that ecosystem functions are more strongly linked to
   species attributes than to diversity per se. Longer-term effects of
   annuals on grassland composition were evident in a dramatic increase in
   biomass of perennial forbs after annuals were removed. Because perennial
   forbs differ from the dominant grass in this grassland in traits that
   influence ecosystem functioning, ES annuals may affect grassland
   functioning more by regulating the composition of vegetation than by
   directly affecting process rates.}},

Abstract = {{Scaled quail (Callipepla squamata pallida Vigors) are closely associated
   with semidesert grasslands of the southwestern United States, and
   populations have declined by as much as 50\% since 1960. Livestock
   grazing, shrub encroachment, and exotic grass invasion are considered
   important factors reducing scaled quail distribution and density in
   Arizona. We investigated habitat use by scaled quail across their range
   in southeastern Arizona to determine the habitat conditions important
   for survival and reproduction. Pointing dogs located quail during autumn
   and winter of 2002-2003 and 2003-2004, and we measured habitat
   characteristics at 52 flush sites and 54 nonuse plots, where scaled
   quail were not found. We recorded information on landform, substrate,
   vegetation, and cover. Scaled quail used areas with grass canopy cover
   >= 26\%, tree canopy cover <= 10\%, and higher grass species richness
   than randomly available. Short (< 50 cm tall) visual obstruction (i.e.,
   cover), usually associated with low shrubs, cacti, and bunchgrass, was
   greater at use sites than at nonuse plots. A logistic-regression
   equation, including visual obstruction and tree canopy variables,
   correctly predicted >= 91 \% of quail use sites. Greater amounts of
   visual obstruction and lower percentages of tree canopy cover
   best-predicted scaled quail sites. Land management practices that reduce
   grass species richness and cover and increase tree cover may reduce
   scaled quail habitat quality and availability in southeastern Arizona.
   Based on habitat use patterns of scaled quail, we recommend that
   semidesert grassland habitats contain a maximum tree canopy of < 6\% and
   > 25\% grass canopy cover at the 20-cm height to provide optimum cover
   availability.}},

Abstract = {{Survey data on breeding wader densities and grazing intensity on coastal
   meadows on the Baltic island of Nand from 1988, 1998 and 2003 were used
   to evaluate density and density-changes of four common and widespread
   wader species, lapwing Vanellus vanellus, redshank Tringa totanus,
   oystercatcher Haematopus ostralegus and ringed plover Charadrius
   hiaticula in relation to grazing intensity. Population trends over time
   and changes in densities in relation to changes in grazing management
   were evaluated. Both wader densities and the environmental variable
   grazing intensity demonstrated significant spatial autocorrelation, but
   all main results were unaffected when accounting for spatial structure
   in the statistical tests. Breeding densities of investigated species
   were positively related to grazing intensity and local changes in
   grazing management affected the local change in wader densities.
   However, average grazing intensity increased over time whereas wader
   numbers generally remained constant or declined. Thus, changes in
   grazing intensity could not explain changes in overall breeding numbers.
   One explanation for this is probably that grazing mainly affected
   distribution of birds. Some evidence of a buffer effect was found in the
   redshank and ringed plover, in which breeding densities declined
   proportionally more in non-shore than in shore habitat. This was
   probably due to a redistribution of birds to shore habitat. It is
   concluded that grazing management is essential for the occurrence of
   waders, but might not be sufficient to ensure long-term viability of
   wader populations on coastal meadows. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Many dehesa zones in marginal areas are suffering from the abandonment
   of traditional farming practices. Herbivore grazing affects grassland
   dynamics, changing the species colonisation and extinction relationships
   via consumption, mechanical disturbance, seed dispersal and altered soil
   fertility due to dung-borne nutrient input. This paper analyses changes
   to floristic composition, species richness and heterogeneity as well as
   soil and light resources in relation to grazing abandonment in two
   characteristic topography-related types of dehesa habitat (upper slope
   and lower slope grasslands). Vegetation surveys were undertaken using
   five replicates in each habitat type in grazed and abandoned grasslands
   in the Guadarrama range in Central Spain with distric cambisol soils.
   Additional measurements of light and soil parameters were also
   undertaken. The results show an effect of grazing on resource
   availability. In general there was a smaller proportion of fine matter
   (clay), organic matter, total nitrogen, assimilable potassium and
   readily available water in abandoned as opposed to grazed zones. We did
   not find any effect of grazing on phosphorous availability. Abandonment
   reduces light availability at ground level in lower slope grasslands
   (wet meadows) but does not produce a significant reduction in upper
   slope (driest) grasslands, although there is an increased spatial
   heterogeneity in the availability of light associated with the presence
   of scattered shrubs. While the total number of species in abandoned
   zones did not significantly differ from grazed zones, floristic
   composition changed dramatically with abandonment in both habitat types,
   with less than 50\% of common species. Also, floristic heterogeneity at
   the small scale increased with abandonment. Designers of
   agri-environmental policies applied to Mediterranean grasslands should
   be aware of the risk of widespread grazing abandonment and promote the
   diversification of grazing regimes across the landscape to maximize
   species diversity and take advantage of the benefits of low-density
   grazing in other functions of the ecosystem such as their productivity
   and stability. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of different grazing intensities of heifers on sward
   parameters such as sward structure, plant species diversity, herbage
   growth and forage quality as well as individual live-weight gains and
   live-weight gains per pasture area were studied in an upland area in the
   northern part of the Czech Republic over 4 years (1998-2001). The sward
   was maintained at a target height of 5 and 10 cm under intensive (IG)
   and extensive (EG) grazing, respectively. The total biomass production
   was higher under the IG than the EG treatment. In the Czech upland
   conditions, double peak curves of biomass growth during the grazing
   season were more typical than curves with one high spring peak. Species
   that responded positively to both treatments were the predominately
   short growing Trifolium repens, Taraxacum spp., Veronica arvensis and
   Agrostis capillaris. Tall species like Senecio ovatus, Alopecurus
   pratensis, Elytrigia repens and Aegopodium podagraria were associated
   with unmanaged plots. Total crude protein contents and forage
   digestibility were higher under IG. The content of crude fibre showed a
   reverse effect. Seasonal live-weight output per hectare under IG was
   approximately 1.5 times higher than EG treatment. However, if state
   subsidies are included, EG can be more profitable under the current
   Czech conditions than IG and satisfies both farmers and nature
   conservation objectives. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Carduus acanthoides and Carduus nutans (plumeless and musk thistles) are
   among the most noxious weeds in the United States of America, presenting
   a serious challenge in cropping and pasture systems. Unfortunately, a
   lack of detailed spatial distribution information hampers both our
   ability to understand the factors affecting their invasive success, and
   the effectiveness of monitoring and management efforts. To examine
   patterns of distribution and co-occurrence at a local level, we sampled
   a 5000 km(2) area of central Pennsylvania that cut a transect across
   known areas of C. acanthoides and C. nutans infestation. A number of
   potential environmental explanatory variables were recorded and analyzed
   to examine whether they correlated with observed species distribution
   patterns. Patterns of forest density and spatial aggregation of the
   thistles were the primary covariates that significantly impacted both
   species' distributions. The survey established that the frequency of
   sightings for each species diminished as the ranges converged, with only

Abstract = {{1. Gradients of animal impact known as piospheres tend to develop around
   artificial watering points, particularly in arid zones. Such grazing
   gradients represent a potential opportunity for differentiating the
   long-term effects of livestock activity from other environmental
   patterns. In this study, the impact of watering point provision on the
   plant cover, species richness and community structure of Karoo
   shrublands, South Africa, was investigated in the context of the
   evolutionary history and current grazing management practices of the
   region.
   2. The impacts of watering point provision were investigated by sampling
   plant cover and composition along transects placed at set distances,
   ranging from 10 m to 2200 m, from 11 watering points.
   3. Karoo vegetation cover and structure are relatively resilient to
   livestock grazing. Karoo plant diversity, as measured by species
   richness, evenness and dominance, was not as resilient. Twice as many
   species decreased as increased near watering points. The majority of
   species that decreased were regarded as being highly palatable to
   livestock. Heavy grazing, leading to death or repeated reproductive
   failure, is the most likely mechanism leading to the decline of such
   species.
   4. The highly disturbed area immediately adjacent to watering points was
   dominated by forbs and contained a large proportion of alien species.
   Adjacent to this was a zone dominated by widespread shrub species of
   medium to low palatability. Areas most distant from watering points
   contained a greater proportion of species known to be highly palatable
   to livestock. The ability of dominant Karoo shrubs to tolerate heavy
   grazing may have allowed rangeland managers to maintain stocking rates
   above that which can be tolerated by the majority of species but which
   are supported by a minority of grazing-tolerant species.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Highly palatable species are more
   abundant in areas distant from water points. Larger paddocks therefore
   provide a refuge for sensitive species that might otherwise be lost from
   the rangeland as a whole. Species that tend to occur away from watering
   points represent potentially useful indicators of grazing pressure. The
   use of these species as indicators of rangeland condition among
   landowners should be promoted.}},

Pages = {{245-254}},

Abstract = {{Question: How do reduced levels of summer grazing by reindeer affect the
   abundance, composition and species richness of mountain plant
   communities?
   Location: Arctic-alpine mountain vegetation 700-850 m a.s.l., Saana
   Conservation Area, northwestern Finnish Lapland.
   Methods: Permanent plots were established in 1990 and resampled in 1999
   or 2001. The number of reindeer had considerably declined from the 1980s
   to the 1990s and we followed the recovery of vegetation. The comparisons
   between 1990 and 1999/2001 were made at seven sites differing in their
   original grazing pressure.
   Results: At the initially heavily grazed sites, lichen abundances
   increased, but at the lightly grazed sites the abundances of lichens
   decreased. Graminoids declined at all sites, but the change seemed to be
   greatest at the most heavily grazed sites. Forbs increased slightly
   across all sites. At the species level, lichens and graminoids responded
   most notably to the reduction of grazing pressure. Individual species
   responses in shrubs were variable and among forbs, typical species of
   species-rich Dryas heaths increased. Total species richness increased at
   all sites and the change was greater at heavily grazed sites. This
   increase resulted mainly from increased bryophyte and lichen species
   richness but also from a slight increase in vascular plant species
   richness.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that lichens are the group most
   responsive to the reduction of heavy summer grazing by reindeer and that
   lichens and forbs typical in arctic-alpine Dryas heaths are favoured
   over graminoids under reduced grazing. Heavy grazing decreases overall
   species richness with the most pronounced effects on bryophyte and
   lichen species richness. The results support the hypothesis that heavy
   summer grazing may shift the composition of mountain plant communities
   towards that of grasslands and show how this shift may be reversed under
   reduced grazing.}},

Abstract = {{The Sierra Madre sparrow Xenospiza baileyi, categorized as Endangered on
   the IUCN Red List, is endemic to Mexico. The subalpine bunch grasslands
   of the Transverse Volcanic Belt in the south of the Valley of Mexico are
   the last remaining habitat of this species. We conducted a detailed
   survey for the Sierra Madre sparrow using the point count method, and
   then described the species' habitat using a phytosociological approach.
   The two sets of information were pooled into a single analytical
   framework to identify priority habitats for the species. Eight
   vegetation communities were distinguished. The Festuca
   lugens-Muhlenbergia quadridentata and Stipa ichu bunch grassland
   communities had the highest densities of the Sierra Madre sparrow.
   Intensive burning and grazing activities and agricultural encroachment
   have restricted sparrow occupancy. Landscape analysis helped to
   delineate core grassland areas for the species and grassland strips and
   islands that could potentially act as habitat corridors. From the
   information generated in this study, which was shared with the local
   communities, we are establishing a participatory socioecological

Abstract = {{Increasing plant species diversity could enhance forage yield,

   Three forage mixtures (2,3, or 11 species) were established on a farm in
   eastern Pennsylvania and grazed by dairy heifers or managed under a
   three-cut hay system from 1999 to 2002. Net canopy photosynthesis was
   measured from early April to early October 2000 to 2002. Root
   distribution to a depth of 60 cm was measured in mid-September each
   year, and soil C and N concentrations to a 15-cm depth were determined
   in May 1999 and September 2002. The 11-species mixture yielded 43\% more
   forage dry matter than the two-species mixture. This difference was
   mainly due to the inclusion of a few highly productive forage species in
   the 11-species mixture. Canopy photosynthesis did not differ among
   mixtures in the spring, but in the summer was 50\% greater in the 3- and
   11-species mixtures than the two-species mixture. The 11-species mixture
   also had 30 to 62\% greater root biomass than the other two mixtures and
   a greater proportion of roots in deeper soil layers. Soil C either
   remained unchanged or decreased, depending on species composition, with
   the greatest decrease occurring in the 11-species mixture. No
   relationship existed between changes in soil C concentration and either
   canopy photosynthesis or above- and below-ground productivity. Deeper
   rooting could reduce drought stress by increasing access to deep soil
   moisture. Selecting forage mixtures to include specific desirable
   traits, such as greater rooting depth, could result in improved pasture
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Recent loss of plant species richness in Swedish semi-natural grasslands
   has led to an increase in grassland recreation and restoration. To
   increase the establishment of declining species favoured by grazing and
   to re-establish original species richness, seed sowing has been
   discussed as a conservation tool. In this study, I examined to what
   extent seed sowing in former arable fields increases species richness
   and generates a species composition typical of semi-natural grasslands.
   Six grassland species favoured by grazing (target species) and six
   generalist species favoured by ceased grazing, were studied in a
   seed-addition experiment. Four different seed densities were used on
   four different grassland categories, two grazed former arable fields,
   one continuously grazed grassland and one abandoned grassland. Target
   and generalist species emerged in all grassland categories, but seedling
   emergence was higher in the grazed than in the abandoned grassland.
   Target species had higher emergence in the two grasslands with the
   longest grazing continuity. Seedling emergence and frequency of
   established plants of each target species were positively associated.
   The largest fraction of seeds germinated at an intermediate sowing
   density, 20-50 seeds/dm(2), suggesting that aggregation of seeds
   positively affects emergence up to a certain threshold. In conclusion,
   artificial seed sowing may induce the recreation of typical grassland
   communities on former arable fields, which may be an important
   contribution to increase the total grassland area and species richness
   in the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Across large areas of upland Britain Molinia caerulea and Nardus stricta
   are replacing Calluna vulgaris as the dominant plant species of the
   vegetation assemblage. Associated changes in the composition of the
   whole plant assemblage and a phytophagous insect group, the Hemiptera,
   were investigated. Vegetation and hemipteran assemblages were sampled at
   six moorland sites in northern England and Scotland. Sampling at each
   site was carried out in Calluna vulgaris-dominated areas and
   grass-dominated areas that had previously been dominated by C. vulgaris.
   Vegetation assemblages of heath and grass sites differed significantly
   even when species by which sites were selected for sampling (C.
   vulgaris, M. caerulea and N. stricta) were removed from the analysis
   with the highest species richness in dry grassland sites. Hemipteran
   assemblages differed significantly between heath and grass sites with
   greater species richness also being in grass sites. Plant species
   composition was the most important explanatory variable of hemipteran
   assemblages with temperature, latitude, soil loss on ignition and
   vegetation height also explaining a significant proportion of the
   variation. overall a range of vegetation composition and structural
   variables explained 40.8\% of variation in the Hemiptera species data
   with ranges of soil and biogeographic variables explaining an additional
   8.7\%.
   This research demonstrates that the replacement of one dominant plant
   species by another is associated with a change in other aspects of
   moorland biodiversity. In particular the loss of C. vulgaris actually
   leads to an increase in the species richness of Hemiptera and plants
   although the number of specialist species declines. (c) 2005 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Grazing in arid Mediterranean ecosystems brings about changes in species
   diversity, but the best way to measure such changes is unclear. In this
   study we compared various methods in order to identify indicators that
   might be useful for the management and conservation of grazed arid
   Mediterranean ecosystems.
   Changes in community structure and composition were compared along a
   previously studied grazing gradient in Cabo de Gata-Nijar Natural Park.
   Plant diversity was measured by calculating diversity (Shannon
   information index), evenness (Pielou index) and richness (species
   number). Rarefaction curves were used to measure plant species richness
   and the results were compared with traditional richness values.
   Community structure was measured as the percentage of bare ground and
   the coverage of overall perennial grasses, Stipa tenacissima L.,
   perennial shrubs and annual plants. Our results showed that the
   proportion of bare ground, the cover of perennial shrubs and the
   relative abundance of S. tenacissima are good indicators of grazing
   effects on vegetation. Overall plant community structure was more
   sensitive to the grazing gradient than were the diversity indices.
   Finally, the adequacy of standardized methods for comparing species
   richness (i.e. rarefaction curves) along a grazing gradient are
   discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies of plant-herbivore interactions have typically focused
   either on short-term or long-term effects. By directly comparing effects
   at different temporal scales, I studied whether short-term experiments
   provide good indications of the long-term effects of herbivory.
   I reciprocally transplanted turfs of tundra heath vegetation within
   areas covered by a long-term (40 years) reindeer manipulation
   experiment, in order to examine the effects of all possible permutations
   of light, moderate and heavy grazing pre- and post-transplantation.
   The effects of a short-term (three growing seasons) increase in reindeer
   grazing pressure gave good qualitative indications of most of the
   long-term effects of grazing on plant biomass, species richness, moss
   cover and lichen cover. In contrast, reducing grazing pressure on
   previously heavily grazed vegetation had no significant effects on any
   of these variables over the same time-scale.
   Although few effects on individual species were recorded from the
   short-term manipulations, all those that were significant were
   qualitatively similar to the long-term responses of the respective
   species to herbivory.
   The grass-dominated vegetation from the heavily grazed area changed
   little when grazing and trampling pressure were reduced for 3 years. In
   contrast, the dwarf shrub-dominated vegetation in the lightly grazed
   area changed rapidly into grasslands when the grazing pressure was
   enhanced.
   Re-establishment of dwarf shrubs appears to be both seed and microsite
   limited, but it appears that dwarf shrubs may be able to re-establish in
   previously heavily grazed vegetation in the absence of reindeer.
   Transitions from moss- or dwarf shrub-dominated ecosystems to
   grass-dominated ecosystems are currently occurring at different
   locations in boreal, arctic and alpine regions due to atmospheric
   nitrogen deposition and livestock grazing. This loss of habitat may be
   reversible, given a relatively long time frame.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in land use and the associated changes in land cover are
   recognized as the most important component of human-induced global
   change. Much attention has been focused on deforestation, but grasslands
   are among the most endangered ecosystems on Earth. The North American
   tallgrass prairie is a dramatic example, exhibiting a greater than 95\%
   decline in historical area. Renewed interest in prairie conservation and
   restoration has highlighted the need for ecological indicators of
   disturbance and recovery in native systems, including the belowground
   component. The tallgrass prairie differs from the agricultural systems
   that have replaced it in having greater diversity and heterogeneity of
   resources, less physical soil disturbance (although other disturbances,
   such as fire and grazing, are prominent), and greater nitrogen
   limitation. Understanding the responses of nematode taxa to these
   characteristic differences is crucial to the development and improvement
   of community indices, but while knowledge of disturbance responses by
   individual taxa is accumulating, the level of necessary taxonomic
   resolution remains in question. Although nematode communities generally
   are better described for temperate grasslands than for other natural
   ecosystems, identification of sentinel taxa is further confounded by
   high levels of diversity, and both spatial and temporal heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the change of species-rich tropical insect
   communities along habitat gradients. Diversity and species richness of
   geometrid moths were investigated at 15 anthropogenically disturbed
   sites in a montane area in the Andes of southern Ecuador representing a
   successional gradient. These plots were compared with six closed-forest
   understorey sites. We collected a total of 2 3,720 individuals
   representing 868 morphospecies. Local diversity increased with forest
   recovery and decreased with increasing distance to the natural forest.
   18.6\% of all species were found as unique singletons. The mean
   proportions of local singletons differed significantly between three
   succession classes. Forest understorey showed a higher proportion of
   singletons than early and late successional stages. Ordination of the
   moth samples showed a clear separation of geometrid ensembles at
   successional sites vs. the forest understorey sites. Patterns of species
   turnover were influenced by the degree of habitat openness, and to a
   lesser extent by elevation. However, faunal differences were not related
   to geographical distances between the sampling sites. In conclusion,
   geometrid moth ensembles of regenerating Andean montane forest remain
   diverse, but change significantly in composition relative to adjacent
   natural forest, whereas the diversity and composition of the geometrid
   fauna are far more strongly affected in non-forested habitats and

Abstract = {{Dry matter (DM) yield and herbage quality of unfertilized mown field
   margin strips were studied during early succession in a field experiment
   over a period of three years. The experiment aimed to maximize botanical
   diversity and was conducted at two different locations with contrasting
   soil type and comprised four vegetation types (spontaneously regenerated
   versus sown vegetation) and three herbage removal strategies (herbage
   left versus herbage removed). The experimental factors investigated were
   location, vegetation and herbage removal. Margin strips were mown twice
   a year with a late first cut around 15 June and a regrowth cut around 15
   September to meet nature conservation objectives. Average DM yield over
   the first three years was not significantly affected by herbage removal
   but increased significantly over time, irrespective of vegetation or
   herbage removal. Initially, sown margin strips significantly outyielded
   unsown margin strips, but differences in DM yield converged over time.
   The mid-June cut yielded significantly more than the regrowth cut but
   its herbage quality was significantly lower. Herbage from the unsown
   margin strip had a significantly better forage quality than herbage from
   sown margin strips. Forage quality decreased over time, irrespective of
   location or vegetation. Changes over time in DM yield and quality were
   attributed to changes in species composition. The herbage quality of
   field margins was lower than the herbage quality of intensively managed
   grassland, limiting its use in rations for highly productive livestock.}},

Abstract = {{The rate at which a plant species is attacked by invertebrate herbivores
   has been hypothesized to depend on plant species richness, yet empirical
   evidence is scarce. Current theory predicts higher herbivore damage in
   monocultures than in species-rich mixtures. We quantified herbivore
   damage by insects and molluscs to plants in experimental plots
   established in 2002 from a species pool of 60 species of Central
   European Arrhenatherum grasslands. Plots differed in plant species
   richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 60 species), number of functional groups (1,
   2, 3, 4), functional group and species composition. We estimated
   herbivore damage by insects and molluscs at the level of transplanted
   plant individuals ({''}phytometer{''} species Plantago lanceolata,
   Trifolium pratense, Rumex acetosa) and of the entire plant community
   during 2003 and 2004. In contrast to previous studies, our design allows
   specific predictions about the relative contributions of functional
   diversity, plant functional identity, and species richness in relation
   to herbivory. Additionally, the phytometer approach is new to
   biodiversity-herbivory studies, allowing estimates of species-specific
   herbivory rates within the larger biodiversity-ecosystem functioning
   context. Herbivory in phytometers and experimental communities tended to
   increase with plant species richness and the number of plant functional
   groups, but the effects were rarely significant. Herbivory in
   phytometers was in some cases positively correlated with community
   biomass or leaf area index. The most important factor influencing
   invertebrate herbivory was the presence of particular plant functional
   groups. Legume (grass) presence strongly increased (decreased) herbivory
   at the community level. The opposite pattern was found for herbivory in
   T. pratense phytometers. We conclude that (1) plant species richness is
   much less important than previously thought and (2) plant functional
   identity is a much better predictor of invertebrate herbivory in
   temperate grassland ecosystems.}},

Volume = {{183}},

Abstract = {{Woody colonization of grasslands is often associated with changes in
   abiotic or biotic conditions or a combination of both. Widely used as
   fodder and litter in the past traditional agro-pastoral system, ash
   (Fraxinus excelsior L.) has now become a colonizing species of mountain
   grasslands in the French Pyrenees. Its present distribution is dependent
   on past human activities and it is locally controlled by propagule
   pressure and abiotic conditions. However, even when all favourable
   conditions are met, all the potentially colonizable grasslands are not
   invaded. We hypothesize that management practices should play a crucial
   role in the control of ash colonization. From empirical field surveys we
   have compared the botanical composition of a set of grasslands (present
   and former) differing in management practices and level of ash
   colonization. We have displayed a kind of successional gradient
   positively linked to both ash cover and height but not to the age of
   trees. We have tested the relationships between ash presence in
   grassland and management types i.e. cutting and/or grazing, management
   intensity and some grassland communities' features i.e. total and local
   specific richness and species heterogeneity. Mixed use (cutting and
   grazing) is negatively linked to ash presence in grassland whereas
   grazing alone positively. Mixed use and high grazing intensity are
   directly preventing ash seedlings establishment, when low grazing
   intensity is allowing ash seedlings establishment indirectly through
   herbaceous vegetation neglected by livestock. Our results show the
   existence of a limit between grasslands with and without established
   ashes corresponding to a threshold in the intensity of use. Under this
   threshold, when ash is established, the colonization process seems to
   become irreversible. Ash possesses the ability of compensatory growth
   and therefore under a high grazing intensity develops a subterranean
   vegetative reproduction. However the question remains at which stage of
   seedling development and grazing intensity these strategies could occur.}},

Abstract = {{Salt occurs naturally at high levels in the subsoils of most Australian
   agricultural land. As a result of clearing native vegetation,
   groundwater tables have risen, mobilising the stored salt and causing
   adverse impacts on farmland, infrastructure, water resources, and
   biodiversity. The main action required to prevent groundwater tables
   from rising is establishment of perennial plants, either herbaceous
   (pastures or crops) or woody (trees and shrubs). Recent technical and
   economic research has emphasised how difficult it will be to establish
   sufficient perennials to get control of groundwater tables. Where
   watertables are already shallow, the options for farmers are
   salt-tolerant plants (e.g. saltbush for grazing) or engineering (e.g.
   deep open drains). The existing options for farm-level salinity
   management are reviewed, with mixed but somewhat disappointing findings
   regarding their suitability for addressing salinity. However, there are
   also a number of good prospects for development of new and better
   options for plant-based management of salinity, and these are described.

Abstract = {{Paddock trees are a common feature in the agricultural landscapes of
   Australia. Recent studies have demonstrated the value of scattered
   paddock trees for soil fertility, native pasture plants and arboreal
   faunas; however, the degree to which scattered paddock trees contribute
   to the conservation of terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity within
   grazed landscapes remains unknown. We ask three questions: (i) Is there
   a difference between the terrestrial invertebrate assemblages found
   under paddock trees compared with surrounding grazed native pastures?
   (ii) Can gradients in soil and litter variables from the base of trees
   explain patterns in invertebrate assemblages? and (iii) Does the
   presence of scattered paddock trees have implications for the
   conservation of terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity within grazed
   native pastures? We used pitfall trapping and extraction from soil cores
   to sample the invertebrate assemblages under six New England Peppermint
   trees (Eucalyptus nova-anglica Deane and Maiden) and compared them with
   assemblages sampled from the open paddock. Formicidae and Collembola
   univariate and multivariate data were analysed along with a range of
   soil and litter variables. We found (i) significant differences in the
   assemblages of invertebrates under trees compared with surrounding
   grazed pastures; (ii) that most soil and litter variables revealed
   gradients away from tree bases and these variables explained significant
   variation in invertebrate assemblages; and (iii) more native
   invertebrates and more species of invertebrates were found under trees
   compared with the surrounding pastures. We discuss the relationships
   between paddock trees, the ground and soil environments and the
   invertebrate communities that inhabit these environments, and conclude
   with a discussion of the future for paddock trees and the biota
   supported by them.}},

Abstract = {{A 3-year study was undertaken on and around a prominent South African
   mesa to determine its role for grasshoppers in a sea of grazed
   flatlands. The number of grasshopper species and individuals on the
   summit, slopes and flatlands varied significantly in relation to
   measured environmental variables. The summit, through inaccessibility to
   livestock grazing, was effectively a conservation refugium for one
   highly responsive grasshopper species, Orthochtha dasycnemis. There was
   no significant difference in species richness between years of sampling,
   although there were significant variations in grasshopper abundance
   between years. The difference in rainfall between years was significant
   and appeared to be the key factor influencing grasshopper population
   dynamics. This study clearly shows that a mesa can act as a conservation
   island and refugium supporting an insect assemblage that would be
   otherwise altered by heavy livestock grazing on the surrounding
   flatlands. This summit assemblage was strongly linked with those on the
   slopes, and is determined by low grazing intensity and associated soil
   and vegetation structure.}},

Abstract = {{Decreasing habitat fragment area and increasing isolation may cause loss
   of plant population genetic diversity and increased genetic
   differentiation between populations. We studied the relation between the
   historical and the present landscape configuration (i.e., patch area and
   patch connectivity), and the present management of calcareous grassland
   fragments on the one hand, and the within and between population genetic
   structure of 18 Anthyllis vulneraria populations on the other hand.
   Despite the long-time fragmentation history and the mainly selfing
   breeding system of the species, we detected very low genetic
   differentiation (phi(st) = 0.056) among habitat fragments and no
   significant isolation-by-distance relation. Average within fragment
   genetic diversity measured as molecular variance and expected
   heterozygosity, were relatively high (16.46 and 0.28, respectively), and
   weakly positively correlated with the current fragment area, most likely
   because larger fragments contained larger populations. We found no
   effects of the historical landscape configuration on the genetic
   diversity of the populations. Our data suggest that the consequences of
   habitat fragmentation for genetic differentiation and genetic diversity
   of A. vulneraria are relatively minor which is very likely due to the
   historical high levels of seed exchange among fragments through grazing
   and roaming livestock. This study provides indirect evidence that nature
   management by grazing not only positively affects habitat quality but
   that it might also mitigate the genetic consequences of habitat
   fragmentation. From the conservation point of view, this study
   illustrates the importance of grazing and of the regular transport of
   livestock between fragments to prevent the long-term effects of
   fragmentation on the genetic diversity of the populations studied. (c)

Abstract = {{The high-altitude rangelands of the Trans-Himalaya represent a grazing
   ecosystem which has supported an indigenous pastoral community for
   millennia alongside a diverse assemblage of wild herbivores including
   burrowing mammals (pikas and voles). Pastoralists consider the small
   mammals to cause rangeland degradation and as competitors for their
   livestock, and actively eradicate them at many places. We present data
   on the ways in which small herbivores like pikas and voles mediate plant
   community dynamics. Vegetation cover and plant species richness were
   compared on and off both active and abandoned small mammal colonies.
   Plant species richness was higher inside colonies (about 4-5
   species/plot) than outside (about 3 species/plot) whereas vegetation
   cover was only marginally lower (52\% compared to 60\%). Soil
   disturbance due to small mammals is seen to be associated with higher
   plant diversity without causing dramatic decline in overall vegetation
   cover. Such disturbance-mediated dynamics and vegetation mosaics produce
   a rich array of testable hypotheses that can highlight how small mammals
   influence assembly processes, succession, and dominance hierarchies in
   plant communities in this and ecosystem. So, eradicating small mammals
   may lead to declining levels of diversity in this ecosystem, and
   compromise ecosystem-functioning. Changes in traditional pastoral
   practices and overstocking are more likely to be responsible for
   degradation. We emphasize that eradicating small mammals can lead to
   loss of diversity in this ecosystem and it is not a solution for the
   degradation problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Small marginal habitats in the rural landscape may play an important
   role for plant species richness as refugias. Little is known how the
   surrounding landscape and landscape history influence these patterns. I
   analysed how plant species richness was affected by isolation, habitat
   area, past and present land use, and if landscape context matters. Plant
   species occurrence in two different types of small marginal habitats
   were analysed, road verges and midfield islets. The study was conducted
   in two different agricultural landscapes in Sweden; one open modern
   agricultural landscape and one traditional rural landscape, and the
   results compared. Present and past land use, and landscape change was
   analysed using aerial photographs and old maps. There was a large
   grassland reduction more than 50 years ago in the modern landscape, when
   there still were quite a lot of grasslands left in the traditional
   landscape. Area and connectivity were more important for plant incidence
   in small remnant habitats in the modem landscape, compared to the less
   fragmented, traditional rural landscape. On the other hand there were
   more grassland specialists, 23\% in the traditional landscape compared
   to 16\%. Species richness became higher on midfield islet if grazing was
   re-introduced. The legacy of surrounding landscape remains in the
   species pool for a long time, at least 50 years, even in small grassland
   fragments. Although small grassland remnants are more sensitive to
   fragmentation effects compared to larger grasslands, they still
   encompass a substantial part of the grassland species pool and may be
   valuable for reconstructing grassland management at a landscape scale.

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{43}},

Abstract = {{1. Increasing concern over the loss of biodiversity in agricultural
   landscapes was one of the reasons for the introduction of
   agri-environment schemes in Europe. These schemes compensate farmers
   financially for any loss of income associated with measures aimed to
   benefit biodiversity. Nevertheless, more than a decade after the
   introduction of the schemes, only a limited number of studies evaluating
   their ecological effects have been published. We assessed the effect of
   the Swiss agri-environment scheme that was designed to maintain and
   increase species richness in hay meadows. In Switzerland, hay meadows
   under this agri-environment scheme (ECA hay meadows) are the most widely
   adopted environmental measure to conserve biodiversity.
   2. We tested whether meadows under the agri-environment scheme had
   higher species richness and species evenness than control meadows,
   whether species richness and species evenness were higher in the centre
   than at the edge of meadows, and whether these effects differed between
   geographical regions.
   3. Biodiversity was sampled in 42 hay meadows in three different
   regions, using a pair-wise comparison of ECA hay meadows with
   conventionally managed hay meadows. Biodiversity was estimated by
   assessing species richness and species evenness of four taxonomic groups
   representing different trophic levels: vascular plants, grasshoppers,
   wild bees and spiders.
   4. Species richness of vascular plants, grasshoppers and wild bees was
   significantly higher on ECA hay meadows than on control meadows, but
   species richness of spiders did not differ. These results were
   consistent across the three study sites, except for the species richness
   of grasshoppers, which showed no difference between the ECA meadows and
   the control meadows in one region.
   5. Species evenness was significantly higher on ECA hay meadows than on
   control meadows for plants and bees but not for spiders and
   grasshoppers. These results were consistent across the three study
   regions for bees and spider species only.
   6. The species richness of vascular plants and spiders was higher at the
   edge than in the centre of both ECA and control meadows, suggesting a
   more extensive management in the meadow edges and a high species
   exchange between adjacent habitats for these two groups.
   7. Synthesis and applications. We conclude that the Swiss
   agri-environment scheme for hay meadows positively affects biodiversity.
   The scheme should be maintained and farmers should be encouraged to
   engage in long-term extensive management. For spiders, the current
   management restrictions are not sufficient, most probably because of
   inappropriate vegetation structure. Therefore, organisms that
   particularly depend on vegetation structure should be targeted with
   additional restrictions: not only the time of the first cut but also the
   frequency of subsequent cuts and the mowing technique may have to be
   adjusted.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate perennial grass-based pastures dominate the high rainfall zone
   of south-eastern Australia and support a major livestock production
   industry. This area has experienced a recent change in overall pasture
   condition, however, typified by a reduction in the abundance of
   perennial grasses and an increasingly prominent winter-annual grass weed
   component. Improving the condition and productivity of these pastures
   can be achieved by improved management but this requires better
   knowledge of the interactions between management options and pasture
   species composition and of the interaction between pasture vegetation
   and the complex effects of a heterogeneous landscape. This paper reports
   the results of an intensive survey of a 60-ha paddock that was designed
   to identify the species present, determine their patterns of
   distribution and examine the relationships between pasture vegetation
   and the environment. The survey of species present in late summer was
   supplemented by the identification of seedlings that later emerged from
   extracted soil cores and by soil physical and chemical analyses. Data
   were analysed using ordination and interpreted with GIS software so that
   topographic features could be considered.
   The most frequently identified taxa were Hypochaeris radicata,
   Austrodanthonia spp. and Bothriochloa spp. ( in late summer) and Vulpia
   spp., Bromus molliformis and Trifolium subterraneum ( winter-annual
   species). Austrodanthonia spp. were commonly found on the drier ridges
   and more acid soils with lower phosphate levels. These were also the
   areas dominated in spring by Vulpia spp. and were generally lower in
   plant species richness overall. The most species-rich areas occurred
   downslope where soil fertility was higher and less moisture stress was
   presumably experienced. The measured environmental factors explained a
   substantial proportion of the variation in the vegetation dataset, which
   underlined the importance of considering landscape effects in the
   management of typical tablelands pastures.}},

Abstract = {{There have been significant declines in the perennial grass ( PG)
   content in native and sown pastures across temperate Australia. Not only
   has this reduced agricultural productivity, it has contributed to more
   serious degradation, such as loss of soil and biodiversity, decreasing
   water quality, and dryland salinity caused by rising watertables.
   Results from the Sustainable Grazing Systems Key Program (SGS) research
   undertaken at Carcoar on the Central Tablelands of New South Wales were
   reported by Michalk et al. ( 2003). This research indicated that grazing
   management tactics can be used to manipulate pasture composition,
   thereby changing animal production and water-use patterns. The main
   grazing tactic investigated was termed a summer grazing rest, where
   resting was imposed in late spring if PG composition was < 50\%.
   Reported in this present paper is an economic framework for valuing the
   long-term benefits of grazing management tactics. The framework involves
   the development of a bioeconomic modelling system that links a dynamic
   programming model with biophysical models for water and environmental
   processes, soil fertility, pasture growth, livestock energy requirements
   and the change in pasture species composition. The study concludes that
   long-term economic returns are improved by strategies, e. g. a summer
   rest, that lead to an increase in PG composition over time. The study
   also determined that environmental factors, such as deep drainage,
   runoff and soil loss, are reduced as perenniality is increased.}},

Abstract = {{Management of dryland salinity in Australia will require changes in the
   design and utilisation of plant systems in agriculture. These changes
   will provide new opportunities for livestock agriculture. In areas
   already affected by salt, a range of plants can be grown from high
   feeding value legumes with moderate salt tolerance through to highly
   salt tolerant shrubs. A hectare of these plants may support between 500
   and 2000 sheep grazing days per year. The type of plants that can be
   grown and the subsequent animal production potential depend on a range
   of factors that contribute to the `salinity stress index' of a site,
   including soil and groundwater salinity, the extent and duration of
   waterlogging and inundation, the pattern and quantity of annual
   rainfall, soil texture and chemistry, site topography and other site
   parameters. Where the salinity stress index is high, plant options will
   usually include a halophytic shrub that accumulates salt. High salt
   intakes by grazing ruminants depress feed intake and production. Where
   high and low salt feeds are available together, ruminants will endeavour
   to select a diet that optimises the overall feeding value of the
   ingested diet.
   In areas that are not yet salt affected but contribute to groundwater
   recharge, perennial pasture species offer an opportunity for improved
   water and salt management both on-farm and at the catchments. If
   perennial pasture systems are to be adopted on a broad scale, they will
   need to be more profitable than current annual systems. In the high
   rainfall zones in Victoria and Western Australia, integrated bioeconomic
   and hydrological modelling indicates that selection of perennial pasture
   plants to match requirements of a highly productive livestock system
   significantly improves farm profit and reduces groundwater recharge. In
   the low to medium rainfall zones, fewer perennial plant options are
   available. However, studies aiming to use a palette of plant species
   that collectively provide resilience to the environment while
   maintaining pro. table livestock production may also lead to new options
   for livestock in the traditional cropping zone.}},

   grasslands: Prerequisites for preserving plant species diversity}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{280-288}},
Abstract = {{We studied plant species responses to environmental conditions in
   floodplain grasslands (alliance Cnidion) of the river Elbe (northern
   Germany) in order to describe relationships between species
   composition/diversity and underlying site gradients. We analysed a total
   area of 639ha of floodplain grasslands, using 98 sampling plots.
   Vegetation responses to environmental conditions were examined by means
   of DCA. The relationships between species diversity and environmental
   conditions were examined using regression analyses. Our results show
   that species composition and species richness are mainly affected by
   present-day utilization, by the phosphate supply and by the productivity
   of stands. Species richness decreases significantly under grazing, with
   increasing phosphate supply and productivity of stands. Intermediate
   productivity levels, mowing and high inundation frequencies promote
   floodplain target species. N-inorg availability and base availability
   have only a minor impact on species composition/species diversity.
   Productivity is closely related to the amount of plant available
   phosphate. Low phosphate concentrations in the topsoil are particularly
   characteristic of Cnidium dubium floodplain meadows. Therefore, it is
   likely that in floodplain grasslands with low to intermediate
   productivity, phosphate is the most important factor influencing plant
   competition and plant species diversity. We hypothesize that an
   increased phosphate supply increases stand productivity and, hence, the
   competition for light, thus excluding weak competitors. This
   interpretation is supported by the present-day distribution of C. dubium
   floodplain meadows of the river Elbe: these are concentrated in the
   hybrid (between summer and winter dykes) and fossil floodplain (landward
   side of winter dykes), but have been replaced in the functional
   floodplain by grass-dominated plant communities as a result of a steady
   increase in the river water phosphate content. It is, therefore, only in
   the hybrid and fossil. floodplain grasslands that species diversity may
   be preserved in the tong term, as the P input is lower here than in the
   functional floodplain. (c) 2005 Gesellschaft fur Okologie. Published by

Pages = {{307-319}},
Abstract = {{A field experiment was conducted to examine the effects of habitat
   fragmentation on herbivore damage to individually tagged leaves of
   Betonica officinalis rosettes. Fragments of different size and
   corresponding control plots were established at three study sites in
   nutrient-poor calcareous grasslands in the northern Swiss Jura
   mountains. Leaf damage was recorded three times over the growing season
   (late spring, summer and early autumn). Five years after the initiation
   of the fragmentation, the density of rosettes did not differ between
   fragments and control plots. The number of leaves per rosette was higher
   in fragments than in control plots in summer but not in late spring and
   early autumn. The extent of leaf damage, expressed as proportion of leaf
   area removed by invertebrate herbivores, increased over the vegetation
   period. Leaf damage was greater in fragments than in control plots at
   two study sites, whereas the opposite (less strongly expressed) was
   found at the third site. Number of species and density (individuals per
   m(2)) of potential herbivores (gastropods and grasshoppers) were
   recorded in all. fragments and control plots. Effects of fragmentation
   on the number of species and densities depended on plot size and
   differed between gastropods and grasshoppers. Leaf damage in fragments
   increased with increasing density of gastropods if the third site, which
   had lowest leaf damage, was excluded. Such a positive relationship was
   neither found in control plots nor for grasshopper densities. Thus,
   movement of gastropods in fragments was probably restricted which
   resulted in increased feeding pressure at least in two sites. However,
   even if our fragmentation experiment was well designed and replicated,
   the interpretation of these experimental results remains difficutt
   because there was large site-to-site and seasonal variation. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{Local. plant community composition and structure may be largely
   influenced by germination and seedling establishment from seeds
   dispersed in animal dung, through seed input, gap creation and nutrient
   enrichment. With an experimental approach we assessed (1) what the
   effect is of dung deposition on the number of seedlings in the plant
   community 3 months and 1 year after dung deposition, (2) what the effect
   is of this seedling establishment on the local plant community
   characteristics such as species richness and (3) if this effect
   interacts with large-scale soil disturbance which removes the close
   canopy, such as sod-cutting. Viable seeds of monocotylous species were
   abundantly present in the dung, and dung deposition led to a higher
   number of monocotylous seedlings after 3 months. However, this effect
   was no longer significant after 1 year. Moreover, the proportion of
   viable monocotylous seeds that effectively established in the field
   after 3 months was less than 5\%. A lower number of viable seeds of the
   less-dominant dicotylous species was dispersed in the dung but they had
   a higher cover and species richness after 1 year. This resulted in an
   increased total small-scale species richness and diversity after dung
   deposition through a decreasing dominance of monocotylous species.
   Sod-cutting had a pronounced effect on seedling emergence: viable seeds
   dispersed by dung had a higher probability of successful establishment
   when the dung was deposited in large gaps. This, indicates that an
   increase of safe sites associated with disturbance strengthens the
   effects of seed dispersal and gap creation by dung deposition. (c) 2006

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{433-442}},
Abstract = {{The availability of suitable microsites for seedling recruitment is of
   high importance for the successful restoration and maintenance of
   species diversity in semi-natural grassland communities. In this
   context, disturbances imposed by management are known to have a strong
   impact on microsite quality. We investigated the effects of different
   mowing regimes on seedling recruitment of six typical flood-meadow herbs
   in seed addition experiments in two alluvial grasslands with different
   flooding regimes. One study site was situated in the functional
   floodplain and the other one in the fossil floodplain, which is
   protected against direct flooding by a dyke and only submerged by
   ascending groundwater. Treatments included three different mowing
   regimes: (i) mowing in September, (ii) mowing in June, (iii) mowing in
   May and August. Seedling recruitment was monitored over 2 years.
   In both studied meadows a low percentage of final establishment (< 4\%)
   occurred, suggesting a lack of suitable microsites in the sward.
   Particularly, germination of the small-seeded Inula salicina largely
   failed while the large-seeded Iris spuria showed the highest number of
   germinated seeds. The applied mowing regimes affected recruitment of
   individual flood-meadow species differently. A positive effect of mowing
   twice in May and August could only be found for Serratuta tinctoria.
   Thus, flexible mowing regimes that vary among years are probably most
   useful to ensure seedling recruitment of a broad variety of flood-meadow
   species. (c) 2005 Geseltschaft fur Okologie. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Abstract = {{I investigated the relative importance of abiotic factors in species
   assemblage distribution in remnant calcareous grassland heavily grazed

   Direct gradient analysis (using CCA) revealed that the prevalent pattern
   in this grassland was represented by species-poor patches (grassland
   with Carduus pycnocephalus), versus species-rich patches (grassland with
   Cerastium ligusticum and grassland with Eryngium campestre). Species
   exclusive to dry grasslands and pastures, such as Carlina corymbosa,
   Anthemis tinctoria and Xeranthemum inapertum, were positively correlated
   with low nutrient availability, while species common to disturbed
   habitats, such as Hordeum murinum, Dasypyrum villosum and Bromus
   sterilis, were correlated with high nutrient availability and with
   deposition of dung and urine by grazing animals. The variations in
   environmental factors is only partially responsible for the spatial
   patterns in the species data. Open grassland in general agreed with the
   classification based on species data when considering environmental
   variables, while Prunus spinosa scrubland showed 65\% of the samples
   misclassified and shrubby grassland with Cerastium arvense, as well as
   Juniperus communis scrubland did not show any sample classified in their

Abstract = {{Ecosystem level processes and species interactions have become important
   concepts in conservation and land management. Despite being New
   Zealand's greatest contributors to global diversity, native
   invertebrates have been largely overlooked in the assessment of land
   values, and their diversity has often been assumed to reflect native
   plant diversity without justification. Invertebrates can in fact affect
   plant species composition, and in ecosystems such as New Zealand's
   remaining indigenous and semi-modified tussock grasslands can do so in
   excess of more conspicuous vertebrate grazers. An understanding of the
   interactions between invertebrates and their plant hosts may be
   informative in assessing land conservation values, increase the
   efficiency of rapid inventory analyses and would be applicable across
   the production-conservation spectrum. This study considers the
   Curculionoidea, vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen communities of two
   semi-modified tussock grasslands in the Otago region of southern New
   Zealand. Quantitative plant and invertebrate sampling were carried out
   in January 2001. Data were analysed using ANalysis Of SIMilarity
   (ANOSIM) and Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) ordination techniques.
   Vascular plant, bryophyte and lichen species richness was highest in the
   same site and plots as native weevil species richness, however the
   proportion of native vegetation in these locations was lower.
   Associations identified between Curculionoidea and vascular plants were
   dismissed due to the confounding effect of species frequency across
   samples. This appeared to have little influence on associations with
   bryophytes and/or lichens and these were given more weighting. The
   ecological implications of associations are considered and variability
   in weevil composition is discussed in reference to the tussock grassland
   environment. The importance of plant-invertebrate relationships to
   conservation and the uses and limitations of the PRIMER MDS ordination
   technique for determining associations are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the abundance and species richness of heteropteran bugs
   and explored environmental factors which influence bug diversity in
   three types of semi-natural habitats (wildflower areas, extensively used
   meadows, extensively grazed pastures). To cover this topic, it is
   essential to know how much the relatively young wildflower areas
   contribute to biodiversity compared with well-established extensive
   meadows and pastures. Total bug species richness and phytophagous bug
   species richness were significantly higher in wildflower areas and
   meadows than in pastures. In wildflower areas, we found the highest
   number of zoophagous bug species and species overwintering in the
   egg-stage. Species overwintering as adults were most abundant in
   meadows. Total number of bug species as well as species richness in
   either trophic groups and overwintering strategies were significantly
   positively correlated with vegetation structure. Except for
   overwintering strategies, the same was true to bug abundance. The bug
   community based on the number of individuals per species was
   significantly explained by flower abundance and vegetation structure,
   accounting for 18.4 and 16.8\% of the variance, respectively. Our
   results indicate that vegetation structure and flower abundance are key
   factors for bug species richness, abundance and bug species composition.
   Since wildflower areas and meadows clearly increased bug species
   richness and contained several specialised bug species that did not
   occur in pastures, we recommend the promotion of wildflower areas and
   extensively used meadows in order to restore both high heteropteran
   diversity and overall insect biodiversity in agricultural landscapes.}},

Title = {{Biological control of the terrestrial carbon sink}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{147-166}},
Abstract = {{This lecture reviews the past (since 1964 when the International
   Biological Program began) and the future of our understanding of
   terrestrial carbon fluxes with focus on photosynthesis, respiration,
   primary-, ecosystem-, and biomeproductivity.
   Photosynthetic capacity is related to the nitrogen concentration of
   leaves, but the capacity is only rarely reached under field conditions.
   Average rates of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are closely
   correlated and operate near 50\% of their maximal rate, with light being
   the limiting factor in humid regions and air humidity and soil water the
   limiting factor in arid climates. Leaf area is the main factor to
   extrapolate from leaves to canopies, with maximum surface conductance
   being dependent on leaf level stomatal conductance. Additionally, gas
   exchange depends also on rooting depth which determines the water and
   nutrient availability and on mycorrhizae which regulate the nutrient
   status. An important anthropogenic disturbance is the nitrogen uptake
   from air pollutants, which is not balanced by cation uptake from roots
   and this may lead to damage and breakdown of the plant cover.
   Photosynthesis is the main carbon input into ecosystems, but it alone
   does not represent the ecosystem carbon balance, which is determined by
   respiration of various kinds. Plant respiration and photosynthesis
   determine growth (net primary production) and microbial respiration
   balances the net ecosystem flux. In a spruce forest, 30\% of the
   assimilatory carbon gain is used for respiration of needles, 20\% is
   used for respiration in stems. Soil respiration is about 50\% the carbon
   gain, half of which is root respiration, half is microbial respiration.
   In addition, disturbances lead to carbon losses, where fire, harvest and
   grazing bypass the chain of respiration. In total, the carbon balance at
   the biome level is only about 1\% of the photosynthetic carbon input, or
   may indeed become negative. The recent observed increase in plant growth
   has different reasons depending on the region of the world:
   anthropogenic nitrogen deposition is the controlling factor in Europe,
   increasing global temperatures is the main factor in Siberia, and maybe
   rising CO(2) the factor controlling the carbon fluxes in Amazonia.
   However, this has not lead to increases in net biome productivity, due
   to associated losses. Also important is the interaction between
   biodiversity and biogeochemical processes. It is shown that net primary
   productivity increases with plant species diversity (50\% species loss
   equals 20\% loss in productivity). However, in this extrapolation the
   action of soil biota is poorly understood although soils contribute the
   largest number of species and of taxonomic groups to an ecosystem.
   The global terrestrial carbon budget strongly depends on areas with
   pristine old growth forests which are carbon sinks. The management
   options are very limited, mostly short term, and usually associated with
   high uncertainty. Unmanaged grasslands appear to be a carbon sink of
   similar magnitude as forest, but generally these ecosystems lost their C
   with grazing and agricultural use.
   Extrapolation to the future of Earth climate shows that the biota will
   not be able to balance fossil fuel emissions, and that it will be
   essential to develop a carbon free energy system in order to maintain
   the living conditions on earth.}},

Abstract = {{An important challenge for riparian management is to determine the
   extent to which landscape context influences the faunal assemblages of
   riparian habitats. We examined this challenge in the variegated
   landscapes of southeastern Queensland, Australia where riparian
   vegetation is surrounded by both extensive grazing and intensive
   cropping. We investigated whether riparian habitats adjacent to
   different landuses support similar bird assemblages. Three types of
   riparian habitat condition were sampled (uncleared ungrazed; uncleared
   grazed; cleared grazed) in four different land-use contexts (ungrazed
   woodland; grazed woodland; native pasture; crop) although only six of
   the 12 possible treatment combinations were available. Eighty percent of
   bird species responded significantly to changes in both riparian habitat
   condition and landscape context, while fewer than 50\% of species were
   significantly influenced by landscape context alone. The influence of
   landscape context on the bird assemblage increased as the surrounding
   land use became more intensive (e.g., woodland to native pasture to
   crop). Riparian zones have been shown to have consistently high
   biodiversity values relative to their extent. These findings suggest it
   is not enough to conserve riparian habitats alone, conservation and
   restoration plans must also take into consideration landscape context,
   particularly when that context is intensively used land. (c) 2005

Abstract = {{In a Southern Alps watershed, the authors have studied density,

   secondary succession, submitted or not to grazing. Stratified sampling,
   based on a geographic information system, allowed to take in account
   relevant historical and ecological parameters and to correlate them with
   seed bank and vegetation. Data show that (i) density and richness of the
   grassland and shrubland seed bank were higher in ungrazed as compared to
   grazed areas, (ii) similarity between seed bank and vegetation increased
   along the succession, before decreasing in old-growth forests, and (iii)
   seed banks of these forests were markedly different from those of
   younger forests. Bitmap correlation tests show that, whatever was the
   dynamic stage, edaphic variables were responsible for structuring soil
   seed banks. In this mountain area, vegetation emphasizes vegetative
   reproduction at the expense of long life seed bank establishment.
   Pastoralism thus appears as the only mean allowing maintenance of the

Volume = {{42}},

Pages = {{67-74}},
Abstract = {{A considerable portion of the former dry and dry-transition-to-moist
   forests of Puerto Rico dominated by Bucida buceras L. was transformed by
   land clearing and periodic fires to tall grasslands dominated by
   Urochloa maximum Jacq. and savannas with scattered small trees and
   shrubs. These communities, maintained by fires, are relatively stable
   and difficult to reforest. A study was carried out to test whether
   natural recolonization of forest species might be accelerated by
   excluding grazing livestock or by planting trees to facilitate natural
   succession. Experimental treatments included grazing exclusion and
   planting of Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit (giant variety) at 2 x 2
   m and 4 x 4 m, as well as an unprotected control. Tree growth,
   herbaceous aboveground biomass, and floristic diversity were monitored
   in experimental plots for 6 years. Floristic diversity (principally
   weedy species) increased during the first 3 years in grazed plots but
   decreased thereafter; biodiversity in grazing-protected plots decreased
   steadily over time. Herbaceous biomass remained fairly constant in
   grazed plots, increased gradually in protected plots, and decreased
   precipitously in planted plots after tree basal area surpassed 8
   m(2)/ha. The results of this study suggest that while the suppression of
   dominant grasses, either by controlled grazing or shading by planted
   trees can facilitate regeneration of native dry forest plant species,
   this process is both slow and uncertain on highly degraded sites, and
   likely to require decades before natural succession processes result in
   vegetation structure and species composition resembling that of native
   dry forest stands.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyses the effect of resource availability (i.e. sheep
   dung) on dung beetle communities in an arid region of Central Spain,
   both at regional and at local scales. A total of 18 sites within 600
   km(2) were sampled for the regional analysis and 16 sites within the 30
   km(2) of an Iberian municipality were sampled for the local analysis.
   Spatial and environmental characteristics of sampling sites were also
   compiled at both scales, including measures of grazing activity
   (livestock density at regional scale, and two counts of rabbit and sheep
   dung at local scale). At a regional scale, any environmental or spatial
   variable can help to explain the variation in abundance. However,
   species richness was related to summer precipitation and composition was
   related to elevation. At local scale, abundance is not significantly
   related to any of the environmental variables, but species richness was
   related to the local amount of sheep dung (27\% of variance). The amount
   of dung in a 2-km buffer around the site accounts for 27-32\% of
   variance in abundance and 60-65\% of variance in species richness. The
   presence of the flock with the highest sheep density explains 53\% of
   abundance variability and 73\% of species richness variance. A cluster
   analysis of localities identified two main groups, one characterized by
   a lower abundance and species richness that can be considered a nested
   subsample of the species-rich group. The mean and maximum amount of
   sheep dung in the sites separated by less than 2 km are the only
   significant explanatory variables able to discriminate both groups.
   These results suggest that grazing intensity (and the associated
   increase in the amount of trophic resources) is a key factor in
   determining local variation in the diversity and composition of dung
   beetle assemblages. However, dung beetle assemblages are not spatially
   independent at the analysed resolution, and the amount of dung in the
   surroundings seems to be more important for locally collected species

Title = {{Fifty years vegetation development of a xerothermic calcareous grassland
   in Central Europe after heavy disturbance}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{201}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{249-267}},
Abstract = {{Fifty years ago on the south-facing slope of a limestone hill 4 kin NE
   of Gottingen (Germany) a small plot of 4 in 2 size was chosen in a
   xerothermic calcareous grassland (Mesobromion alliance) for
   investigation. The formerly grazed slope was abandoned a few years prior
   to the study, but in 1987 intermittent grazing started again. The mean
   annual temperature in Gottingen (1953-2003) was 8.8 degrees C on the
   average; the annual mean increased by 1.1 degrees C during the study
   period. Mean annual precipitation amounted to 642mm (393-1093mm). The
   mean monthly precipitation during summer (April-August) varied in the
   range between 29 and 101 mm. In the years 1953-2003 the presence of
   species was recorded annually in 400 subplots (100 cm(2) each). In part
   of this time also the amount of bare soil within the plot was recorded,
   and standing crop and the nitrogen contents in leaves of Bromus erectus
   were measured in the immediate surrounding of the plot.
   In fall 1953 the vegetation was removed completely in half of the plot,
   in the other half the two dominant grasses Bromus erectus and
   Brachypodium pinnatum were left. The differences between the two halves
   vanished already after 2 years (starting phase 1953-1955). Thus, only
   results concerning the plot as a whole are reported here. During the
   investigation three periods could be distinguished. After the starting
   phase in period I (1955-1986) total presence, presence of the most
   important species, species richness, number of endangered species,
   diversity and evenness increased. In this way the grassland regenerated
   after the heavy disturbance, and a dense, species-rich vegetation
   formed. Only a few species showed maximum values already within the
   first 10 years and faded out later. Period II (1987-1997) spanned 10
   years of grazing. During this time total presence, presence of many
   important species, species richness, number of endangered species,
   diversity and evenness decreased, whereas areas with bare soil
   increased. Only two species showed maximum values during this phase, and
   just one new species invaded (Lolium perenne). During this period a more
   open type of grassland was formed. Period III (1998-2003) spanned 5
   years without grazing and only one grazing year (2002). Here, a partial
   regeneration of a more closed grassland took place with traits similar
   to period I.
   Several. phenomena occurred continuously through all three periods.
   Bromus erectus always was the dominating species. Nevertheless,
   proportions of graminoids (in \% total presence) were lowered, and the
   proportion of herbs increased. The ratio Bromus erectus/Brachypodium
   pinnatum was determined mainly by Braehypodium. Seedlings of woody
   plants were always present, but in most cases survived only one summer.
   Shrubs did not settle inside the plot, although small bushes developed
   in the immediate surrounding. In summary the 50-year process can be
   described as a slow recovery of a calcareous grassland after very heavy
   disturbance, modified by intermittent grazing, without formation of
   shrub vegetation. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of cattle activities on gap colonization in mountain pastures}},
Journal = {{FOLIA GEOBOTANICA}},
Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{289-304}},
Abstract = {{Cattle influences gap dynamics in pastures in two ways: (1) by creating
   gaps and (2) by affecting the colonization process. This effect of
   cattle activity on gap revegetation can be subdivided in three main
   factors: herbage removal, trampling and dung and urine deposition. The
   objective of this study was to assess how these three effects moderate
   the plant succession following gap creation.
   In an exclosure, four controlled treatments simulating cattle activity
   (repeated mowing, trampling, manuring and untreated control) were
   applied on plots of 2 X 2 in. In the centre of each plot, one artificial
   gap of 60 X 60 cm was created. During three years, vegetation changes
   were monitored in spring and in autumn, with 2 a square grid of 100
   cells of 0.01 m(2) centred on the gap.
   Our experiment confirmed that fine-scale gap creation may have a high
   impact on relative abundances of species in the community. The gap
   environment acts on species as a filter and this filtering was described
   in terms of regenerative attributes. Colonizers were species with small
   seeds, unspecialized seed dispersal, persistent seed bank and high
   vegetation spread. However, the role of dung deposition, herbage removal
   or trampling by cattle did not seem to be of primary importance in the
   revegetation process, but could moderate vegetation response. Therefore,
   the different cattle effects act as secondary filters that selectively
   favoured or disadvantaged different species from the gap-regenerating
   community. These complex interactions are probably keys to understand
   plant coexistence in perennial grasslands.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aim We examined changes in the species diversity and faunal composition
   of arctiid moths along a successional gradient at a fine spatial scale
   in one of the world's hot spots for moths, the Andean montane rain
   forest zone. We specifically aimed to discover whether moth groups with
   divergent life histories respond differentially to forest recovery.
   Location Southern Ecuador (province Zamora-Chinchipe) along a gradient
   from early successional stages to mature forest understorey at
   elevations of 1800-2005 m a.s.l.
   Methods Moths were sampled with weak light traps at 21 sites
   representing three habitat categories (early and late succession, mature
   forest understorey), and were analysed at species level. Relative
   proportions were calculated from species numbers as well as from
   specimen numbers. Fisher's alpha was used as a measure of local
   diversity, and for ordination analyses non-metric multidimensional
   scaling (NMDS) was carried out.
   Results Proportions of higher arctiid taxa changed distinctly along the
   successional gradient. Ctenuchini (wasp moths) contributed more strongly
   to ensembles in natural forest, whereas Lithosiinae (lichen moths)
   decreased numerically with forest recovery. Arctiid species diversity
   (measured as Fisher's alpha) was high in all habitats sampled. The three
   larger subordinated taxa contributed differentially to richness:
   Phaegopterini (tiger moths) were always the most diverse clade, followed
   by Ctenuchini and Lithosiinae. Local species diversity was higher in
   successional habitats than in forest understorey, and this was most
   pronounced for the Phaegopterini. Dominance of a few common species was
   higher, and the proportion of species represented as singletons was
   lower, than reported for many other tropical arthropod communities. NMDS
   revealed a significant segregation between ensembles from successional
   sites and from forest understorey for all larger subordinated taxa
   (Phaegopterini, Ctenuchini, Lithosiinae). Abandoned pastures held an
   impoverished, distinct fauna. Faunal segregation was more pronounced for
   rare species. Ordination axes reflected primarily the degree of habitat
   disturbance (openness of vegetation, distance of sites from mature
   forest) and, to a lesser extent, altitude, but not distance between
   sampling sites.
   Main conclusions Despite the geographical proximity of the 21 sites and
   the pronounced dispersal abilities of adult arctiid moths, local
   ecological processes were strong enough to allow differentiation between
   ensembles from mature forest and disturbed sites, even at the level of
   subfamilies and tribes. Differences in morphology and life-history
   characteristics of higher arctiid taxa were reflected in their
   differential representation (proportions of species and individuals) at
   the sites, whereas patterns of alpha and beta diversity were concordant.
   However, concordance was too low to allow for reliable extrapolation, in
   terms of biodiversity indication, from one tribe or subfamily to the
   entire family Arctiidae. Phaegopterini (comprising more putative
   generalist feeders during the larval stages) benefited from habitat
   disturbance, whereas Ctenuchini (with host-specialist larvae) were more
   strongly affiliated with forest habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Small mammal distribution was studied along a grazing gradient in a

   Smaller small mammals (< 100 g) were sampled using standard trapping.
   The link between habitat and both smaller and larger small-mammal
   distribution on a landscape scale was estimated using landscape
   transects. The relative density of the Microtus oeconomus/limnophilus
   complex ranged from higher levels in fenced grassland and bushes (i.e.,
   low grazing pressure), to lower levels in habitats with a high grazing
   pressure, where this species was not trapped. Ochotona curzoniae, O.
   cansus and Cricetulus kamensis displayed a reverse gradient, with higher
   relative densities in overgrazed habitats (bare ground). The
   distribution of Microtus irene was restricted to two slope habitats:
   rocky slopes and Stellera chamaejasme grassland. Microtus leucurus was
   only trapped in Potentilla fruticosa bushes and in a single grassland
   type with an intermediate stage of degradation. These results suggest a
   differential response of the small mammal species in terms of relative

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of different management inputs
   (fertiliser and seed) and grazing patterns oil plant biodiversity in a

   Cover abundance of vascular and non-vascular plants and environmental
   variables were measured in 32 10 x 10-m plots located in five blocks
   with different management treatments,. Ordination of the floristic data
   separated the block with the highest management inputs from other
   blocks.:Several adventive species were significantly more abundant in
   this block, while several native species were either absent or uncommon,
   but were significantly more abundant in other Study blocks. H. pilosella
   was significantly more abundant in blocks with lower management inputs.
   Diversity was significantly higher in the block with the highest
   management inputs. The native tussock Poa colensoi had significantly
   greater cover abundance while Festuca novae-zelandiae tussocks were
   significantly taller in this block. Our results suggest that high
   management inputs reduce the abundance of H. pilosella and diversity of
   native species, but increase the abundance of other adventive species
   and the cover and vigour of native tussocks. Our results highlight an
   interesting management conundrum for short tussock grasslands. No-input
   management is likely to result in a decline in native biodiversity, as
   well as production values, as H. pilosella mats deplete soil nutrients
   and restrict regeneration of native species. However, input of
   fertiliser and adventive seeds to enhance production values, although
   resulting in an increase in the vigour and abundance of some native
   species (mainly tussocks) and a reduction in H.pilosella abundance, will
   also result in a decline in overall native species richness.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Interactions between the moth Spodoptera littoralis and two of its host
   plants, alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) were
   examined, using plants grown under ambient (350 ppm) and elevated (700
   ppm) CO2 conditions. To determine strength and effects of
   herbivore-induced responses assays were performed with both undamaged
   (control) and herbivore damaged plants. CO2 and damage effects on larval
   host plant preferences were determined through dual-choice bioassays. In
   addition, larvae were reared from hatching to pupation on experimental
   foliage to examine effects on larval growth and development.
   When undamaged plants were used S. littoralis larvae in consumed more
   cotton than alfalfa, and CO2 enrichment caused a reduction in the
   preference for cotton. With damaged plants larvae consumed equal amounts
   of the two plant species (ambient CO2 conditions), but CO2 enrichment
   strongly shifted preferences towards cotton, which was then consumed
   three times more than alfalfa. Complementary assays showed that elevated
   CO2 levels had no effect on the herbivore-induced responses of cotton,
   whereas those of alfalfa were significantly increased. Larval growth was
   highest for larvae fed undamaged cotton irrespectively of CO2 level, and
   lowest for larvae on damaged alfalfa from the high CO2 treatment.
   Development time increased on damaged cotton irrespectively of CO2
   treatment, and on damaged alfalfa in the elevated CO2 treatment.
   These results demonstrate that elevated CO2 levels can cause insect
   herbivores to alter host plant preferences, and that effects on
   herbivore-induced responses may be a key mechanism behind these
   processes. Furthermore, since the insects were shown to avoid foliage
   that reduced their physiological performance, our data suggest that
   behavioural host plant shifts result in partial escape from negative
   consequences of feeding on high CO2 foliage. Thus, CO2 enrichment can
   alter both physiology and behaviour of important insect herbivores,
   which in turn may to impact plant biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Issues relevant to management of and land aquatic ecosystems include:
   (1) a poor understanding of the extent and linkages of an aquatic
   ecosystem, (2) human population growth coupled with a highly variable
   water supply, (3) hydrologic modifications of rivers associated with
   dams, levees, canalizations, and diversions, (4) impairment of water
   quality, (5) alteration of vegetative communities of catchments and
   riparian zones, (6) introduction of invasive non-native species, and (7)
   imperiled native species. All of these issues occur in the Middle Rio
   Grande of New Mexico and the first six in combination have been
   responsible for the imperilment of its native aquatic biota. Pie
   extinction of two fish species, extirpation of 13 others, and
   endangerment of the Rio Grande silvery minnow, a pelagic-spawning
   species with an enormous potential for recolonization of habitats, has
   been caused by a century of river and landscape modifications. Erosion
   from heavily grazed grasslands coupled with appropriation of surface
   flows for irrigation, both associated with human population expansion in
   New Mexico, led to increased sediment deposition in the Middle Rio
   Grande. Sediment deposition exacerbated problems due to flooding and
   droughts, which led to a series of political and technological actions
   that progressively extirpated most of the large-bodied native fishes and
   all but one of the pelagic-spawning minnows. Restoration of the Middle
   Rio Grande and recovery of the endangered silvery minnow will require
   many changes in the way humans use the river and its floodplain. If
   those changes occur they should consider the Rio Grande within a
   Landscape context that includes strategies for humans to live in and
   regions without damaging fragile and lands and their aquatic ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Effects of a grassland minimum care in accordance with

Journal = {{BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{376-387}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In accordance with cross-compliance, grassland which is no longer used
   is to be kept in `' a good agricultural and ecological condition `'. To
   achieve this, one annual mulching after 15 July or one mowing operation
   with removal is scheduled every two years.
   With the help of the results of long-time grassland trials in South
   Western Germany it is demonstrated that it will be difficult to achieve
   the planned goal. The reason is that for the overwhelming majority of
   the currently managed grassland a reduction of 3 to 5 harvesting
   activities to just one maintenance pruning operation will result in
   serious redistributions in the plant stands. Only on lean soils with low
   productivity (yield expectation below 40 quintal of dry matter/ha) this
   type of minimum upkeep is an appropriate measure. In addition, according
   to the present results of the trials it cannot be expected that there
   will be an increase in plant species or a reduction of nutrients in the
   soil. The later in the year such a maintenance pruning operation is
   carried out, the more top grass is dominant and the fewer species the
   plant stands have. From a bio-ecological general perspective it is
   irrelevant whether a measure starting after the summer solstice is
   carried out already during midsummer or only in autumn. Only when there
   is an additional early pruning in May/June, the percentage of herbs
   needing light increases.
   Conclusion: Only if the ecological demands according to cross-compliance
   expressed by buzz-words such as `' Keeping the countryside open `' (=
   prevention of forest) are extremely moderate, A mulch pruning only once
   a year is the right measure. Yet this would not have anything to do with
   I the conservation of a traditional cultural landscape with a high
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{While there has been much debate on the role of landscape corridors or
   linkages for animal movement and residency, there is little information
   on their role in maintaining ecological associations. We assess here the
   arthropod assemblages on flowers, seed heads and leaves of indigenous
   plants in a network of remnant grassland corridors across an alien
   pine-planted landscape in southern Africa. The results showed that the
   arthropod-plant (flowers, seed heads and leaves) associations remained,
   and were mostly quantitatively similar throughout the network of
   corridors. Narrow corridors (20-100 m wide) deep within the
   plantation-grassland mosaic still had high biodiversity value. The most
   threatening factor to flower-arthropod associations was disturbance,
   particularly cattle grazing. That the host plants were actually present
   was, in itself, an indicator that disturbance nevertheless was low. The
   associations are only lost when the plants are lost, and not when the
   plants are present but under some disturbance pressure. Although these
   corridors, which amount to about a third of the total area, mitigate the
   effects of pine afforestation, they can also be conduits for heavy human
   impact. This means that these corridors, even narrow and deep ones, are
   only of maximum value when there is minimal anthropogenic impact.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands resulting from traditional land use practices
   (mowing and grazing) are severely endangered throughout Europe due to
   the intensification of agriculture. The ecological impact of mowing and
   grazing on grassland butterflies was studied in eight mown meadows and
   eight grazed pastures under traditional animal husbandry in NW Russia
   and adjacent Finland. Transect count data over 3 years (1997-1999)
   covered a total of 48 species and 5742 individuals. The butterfly fauna
   was rather similar under both management forms; species richness,
   diversity and total abundance did not differ significantly between
   meadows and pastures, yet meadows were preferred by more species. In
   both groups, the most abundant species were Aphantopus hyperantus,
   Pieris napi and Thymelicus lineola. Of 37 species observed as a minimum
   of five individuals, Polyommatus amandus, Ochlodes sylvanus and A.
   hyperantus showed a significant preference for mowing management.
   According to the ordination, butterfly communities were affected more by
   the origin and age of the grassland than the present management method.
   Landscape factors (meadow or pasture surrounded by forests or open
   environments), the abundance of nectar plants and the intensity of
   tilling were the most important factors differentiating older grasslands

Abstract = {{Upland hay meadows conforming to MG3 in the National Vegetation
   Classification of the UK are a rare habitat in Britain and are largely

   intensification, particularly ploughing and reseeding and a shift from

   large losses of species-rich upland hay meadows. Remaining species-rich
   meadows have been the focus of much nature conservation effort resulting
   in many of the species-rich sites being protected by statutory
   designations or through voluntary agri-environment scheme agreements.
   Research and monitoring has tended to confirm that species richness is
   maximized by management involving spring and autumn grazing, a mid-July
   hay cut, no inorganic fertilizer and possibly low levels of farmyard
   manure. Deviations from this regime result in a loss of species
   richness. Restoration of semi-improved grassland to swards resembling
   species-rich MG3 also requires a similar regime but is also dependent on

Volume = {{42}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. In Panama, abandoned agricultural lands that supported tropical rain
   forest are invaded by the exotic invasive grass Saccharum spontaneum,
   which precludes native forest regeneration. This study aimed to evaluate
   the importance of several barriers to forest regeneration and highlight
   mitigation opportunities.
   2. We examined four barriers to natural regeneration: Saccharum
   competition, seed dispersal limitation, fire and soil nutrient
   deficiency. Tree and shrub regeneration was measured in a factorial
   experiment combining Saccharum cutting treatments, distances from
   adjacent forest and a prescribed burn to assess the first three
   barriers, respectively. We compared soil nutrients in Saccharum plots
   with those from adjacent forest. Additionally, we determined the
   importance of distance to remnant vegetation (large-leaved monocots,
   shrubs and isolated trees) on forest regeneration.
   3. Fire significantly decreased plant species richness of forest
   regeneration. Fire inhibited the germination of most species; the effect
   was exacerbated by cutting the Saccharum.
   4. Grass competition significantly decreased seedling growth, while soil
   nutrient deficiency did not affect forest regeneration.
   5. Seed dispersal limitation affected density and species richness.
   Significantly more species (3x) regenerated at 10 m compared with 35 m
   from the forest. Mean seedling densities were, respectively, four, three
   and two times higher under large-leaved monocots, isolated trees and
   shrubs than in open Saccharum. When seed input was experimentally
   equalized, large-seeded species had the highest establishment rate,
   suggesting that if their propagules were dispersed to the site they
   would regenerate in high proportions. However, under natural conditions
   they regenerated poorly and represented the most dispersal-limited
   species group.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that facilitation of
   natural regeneration may be a feasible, low-cost management option for
   restoring native forest cover to large areas. Firebreaks must be
   established to promote biodiversity of forest regeneration. We do not
   recommend Saccharum cutting or fertilization as site treatments. Shading
   effectively eliminates Saccharum. Planting a variety of tree species in
   clumps throughout the Saccharum may overcome dispersal limitations and
   catalyse natural regeneration. Trees that attract different frugivores
   are recommended, especially large-seeded forest species.}},

Abstract = {{1 Associational resistance is a grazing avoidance mechanism resulting
   from herbivores being less inclined to eat palatable plant species when
   these species grow in association with unpalatable species. Such
   facilitative interactions between plant species may have important
   consequences for patterns of relative abundance and reproduction in
   plant communities.
   2 We studied the relationship between abundance and flowering success of
   palatable species and the cover of three unpalatable species (Senecio
   jacobaea, Iris pseudacorus and Lysimachia vulgaris) in a grassland where
   moderately intense grazing (0.17-0.42 grazers ha(-1)) had been ongoing
   for 3 years. Plots were selected so that there were no systematic
   differences in microenvironmental conditions associated with the level
   of cover of unpalatable species.
   3 Several palatable species had a higher frequency, cover and/or
   flowering success when they grew in the neighbourhood of an unpalatable
   species.
   4 Several species (both palatable and unpalatable) were significantly
   taller in the vicinity of a large unpalatable species, probably due to
   the combined effects of grazing avoidance and increased light
   competition.
   5 These facilitative effects, however, have not yet resulted in a higher
   local species richness or plant community evenness. It is nevertheless
   likely that more pronounced effects will be seen if grazing is
   continued, because facilitative interactions between plant species
   induced by grazing have already led to a shift in patterns of abundance
   and flowering success.}},

Abstract = {{Machair grassland uniquely occurs over sandy, calcareous soils of
   coastal sand-plains in dune systems of north-western Scotland and
   Ireland. This study assesses the plant species composition of Irish
   machair grassland at a landscape-scale. Machair sites were sampled with
   quadrats and multivariate analysis was used to assess relationships
   between species abundance, soil physical variables, livestock grazing
   and recreation activity. Grazing by cattle and sheep was recorded at
   most sites, with recreation activities at nearly half the sites.
   Detrended and Canonical Correspondence Analysis ordinations showed that
   the main gradients of community composition were related to the key
   variables of soil calcium carbonate content, soil organic matter
   content, livestock grazing intensity and recreation pressure. Partial
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that livestock grazing
   intensity and recreation pressure explained about twice as much
   variation as the key soil variables and that rabbit grazing had a much
   smaller but significant effect. Livestock grazing and recreation
   activities were shown to be ecologically damaging in terms of having a
   larger area of bare sand and a lower species diversity. Bare sand can
   increase the risk of storm damage and reduce habitat heterogeneity by
   sand-plain deflation. Controls on livestock density, the length of the
   grazing season and recreation activities are proposed, which we suggest
   would facilitate vegetation recovery. We highlight the need for local
   planning authorities, who control coastal development in Ireland, to
   include agricultural management prescriptions in their machair site

Abstract = {{In 1996, an old forest pasture grazed from the 1960s to 1988 was
   restored by coppicing, fencing and grazing by cattle to protect a local
   population of the endangered butterfly Euphydryas aurinia. An adjoining
   ungrazed meadow provided a control. In the first years, the butterfly
   became almost extinct due to the nearly complete consumption of the host
   plant of the larva, Succisa pratensis, by cattle. The butterfly
   population quickly recovered when the grazing pressure was lowered.
   Thus, the intensity of management should be adjusted by continuous
   monitoring of the target species. In the 2000s, the annual population
   was about 50 butterflies, but marked fluctuations took place, probably
   caused by natural factors. Grazing benefited the meadow flora and
   improved the habitat of butterflies in general. Extensive forest grazing
   clearly has the potential for enhancing biodiversity. The value of the
   experiment is, however, limited because only a single pair of meadows
   was available for comparison. In the future, it will be even more
   difficult to arrange a similar experiment due to the great decline in
   the numbers of traditional meadows and forest grazing in SE Finland.}},

Abstract = {{High small-scale species richness of calcareous grasslands is generally
   thought to result from evening of species competitive potentials by
   limited N availability, because of relatively low herb N/P ratios in
   these Communities. However, P mobility is low in alkaline soils as well.
   We studied soil chemistry and productivity of herb and moss layers in a
   very diverse calcareous meadow (up to 76 vascular plant species per in
   2) to test the hypotheses of a co-limitation of herb productivity by
   both soil N and P availabilities and moss productivity primarily by P
   availability. The effect of nutrient supply on productivity was
   investigated using both a natural productivity gradient as well as
   fertilization experiments. We observed strong positive correlations of
   soil P availability and total soil N with the above-ground productivity
   of herb layer. A long-term fertilization experiment demonstrated that P
   alone and N and P together increased productivity of vascular species,
   and that the productivity continuously declined after cessation of
   fertilization with the effect of previous fertilization occasionally
   visible even 14 years after treatment termination. A short-term
   fertilization experiment further demonstrated that N and P when supplied
   alone increase productivity of vascular plants, suggesting that both
   elements were limiting. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction
   between N and P on productivity, indicating that simultaneous N and P
   supply increased productivity more than separate nutrient additions.
   Moss productivity was negatively associated with vascular plant
   productivity. In particular, N addition decreased moss productivity, but
   moss productivity did not decline in P addition treatments. P
   requirements of mosses were larger than those of vascular plants. Our
   data indicate co-limitation of herb productivity by both soil N and P in
   this highly diverse grassland, while limitation of moss productivity
   mainly by P. We suggest that N and P co-limitations are common in
   calcareous diverse grasslands, and may partly explain the extreme
   small-scale species diversity in these communities. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   margin types were adjacent to intensively managed grass or cereal
   fields. Effects of eight variables on field margin vegetation were
   studied. Despite having many plant species in common, composition and
   species number differed between the two field margin types, due to
   different ecological conditions and margin management. Arable field
   margins were composed of tall and/or nutrient demanding ubiquitous
   species and were characterised by species of later successional stages
   than those of road verges. The vegetation of road verges was lower and
   species numbers were higher than in arable field margins. The road
   verges contained several semi-natural meadow species that are declining
   in abundance. A CCA ordination of the field margins and the recorded
   variables showed that plant species composition was significantly
   affected by thickness of litter, slope, width, moisture level and type
   of crop in the adjacent field. Number of plant species was significantly
   higher in mown than unmown margins and generally higher in margins
   adjacent to fields with mainly grass production than in margins adjacent

Abstract = {{Decision tree, one of the data mining approaches, was used to model the
   relative abundance of five functional groups of plant species, namely
   high fertility response grasses (HFRG), low fertility tolerance grasses
   (LFTG), legume, moss and flatweeds in a New Zealand hill-pasture
   ecosystem using aboveground biomass. The model outputs were integrated
   with a geographic information system (GIS) to map and validate the
   predictions on a pasture. The decision tree models clearly revealed the
   interactions between the functional groups and environmental and
   management factors, and also indicated the relative importance of these
   factors in influencing the functional group abundance. Soil Olsen P was
   the most significant factor influencing the abundance of LFTG and moss,
   while soil bulk density, slope and annual P fertiliser input were the
   most significant factors influencing the abundance of legume, HFRG and
   flatweeds, respectively. Generally, slope and soil Olsen P were the two
   key factors underlying the patterns of abundance for these five
   functional groups. For the five functional groups studied, there was an
   overall predictive accuracy of 75\%. Modelling functional group
   abundance simplified the investigation of the complex interrelationship
   between species and environment in a pasture ecosystem. The integration
   of the decision tree with GIS in this study provides a platform to
   investigate community structure and functional composition for a pasture
   over space, and thus can be applied as a tool in pasture management. (c)

Abstract = {{Effects of grassland management type and intensity on carabid species
   richness, number of individuals and species composition were studied in
   the Swiss Prealps. Carabids were censused in 2001 and 2002 in 21 mown
   and 20 grazed meadows by means of pitfall traps.
   Mean species richness was significantly higher in mown plots than in
   grazed plots and species composition was significantly different between
   these two management types. Additionally, different species
   characteristic for mown and grazed plots were found. These results
   suggest that mown meadows and grazed meadows represent two habitat types
   for carabid beetles.
   Within both habitats, management intensity was quantified by fertilizing
   intensity, the number of cuts, cattle density and/or grazing intensity.
   The relationship between management intensity and the number of
   individuals and species was positive. Higher fertilizing intensity was
   the most important factor for higher species richness and had a
   significant influence on species composition in both habitats. Other
   variables positively related to the number of individuals, were the
   number of cuts in mown meadows and grazing intensity and altitude in
   grazed meadows. Additionally to fertilizing intensity, cattle density
   was positively related to the number of species in grazed meadows. These
   results illustrate that in the extensive management systems found in the

Abstract = {{Question: What is the importance of the seed bank in the maintenance of
   the restoration potential of a 60-year-old abandoned calcareous
   grassland overgrown by Pinus trees?
   Location: `Les Pairees', province of Luxembourg,Belgium.
   Methods: The seed bank and the above-ground vegetation were surveyed in
   three adjacent stands, previously forming a unique calcareous grassland:
   a 60-year-old Pinus forest, a four-year-old clear-cutting and a typical
   calcareous grassland. Floristic diversity was compared among stands and
   between vegetation and seed bank.
   Results: The species richness of the vegetation and the seed bank was
   significantly lower in the Pinus forest. More floristic similarities
   were found between the clear-cutting and the calcareous grassland. Seed
   bank was essentially transient, dominated by annual species. Its
   correspondence with the above-ground vegetation was weak.
   Conclusion: Very few calcareous grassland species have persisted in the
   Pinus stand. Four years after clear-cutting, the stand was nearing
   restoration towards a calcareous grassland. Seed longevity in the soil
   was not the most explicative factor. Dispersal of propagules from
   adjacent sources was also important.}},

Abstract = {{The Khangchendzonga Biosphere Reserve in the Sikkim State, India, with
   an area of 2620 km(2), forms an important reserve to protect
   biodiversity, habitats, and landscapes of the eastern Himalayan region.
   More than 18\% of the area supports alpine vegetation, which is
   extensively used as summer grazing grounds by transhumance and nomadic
   graziers. Despite the global recognition of the region, unfortunately no
   report has so far been rnade available oil the vegetation composition of
   the reserve. The present paper reports on floral diversity, economic
   use, and nutrient contents of selected alpine pastures at elevations
   between 3800 and 4800 in above sea level in the Khangchendzonga
   Biosphere Reserve. The growing season lasts from April to October, and
   during the rest of the months, the area remains under snow. The
   pastureland showed high species richness: as many as 202 plant species
   were present. These belong to 38 families, of which 90\% of the species
   are dicotyledons and 9\% are rnonocotyledons. Plant diversity and
   density increased from April until August and decreased thereafter.
   Monocotyledon species, Such as Poa angustifolia, show high dominance
   during the early and late parts of the growing season, whereas dicot
   species proliferate mainly during the middle part of the growing season.
   Asteraceae, Ranunculaceae, Ericaceae, Primulaceae, and Rosaceae are
   dominant plant families in the area. Life-form distribution patterns
   showed that > 50\% of the species were chamaephytes, showing high
   adaptation by the plants. Besides using the area for grazing, the local
   people also collect various species for medicine, incense,
   tea-substitute, and aesthetic purposes. The belowground plant parts
   contributed nearly 90\% of total plant biomass, whereas the aboveground
   biomass contributed just 10\%. Such partitioning of biomass is
   considered beneficial in pastureland, as the belowgroud biomass helps
   the immediate recovery of vegetation after grazing as well its at the
   start of the growing season. Most of the species are highly nutritive
   and have high mineral contents, and animals showed a preference for
   species with low lignin content. In order for the area to continue to
   provide an important pasturage for animals in the future, the grazing
   pressure must not exceed an optimum level so that the high species
   diversity can be conserved.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive exotic plants are a significant threat to areas of conservation
   value, with endangered ecological communities being especially
   vulnerable. We assessed the role of different anthropogenic disturbances
   in determining the success of exotic plants in the endangered Cumberland
   Plain Woodland community of western Sydney and examined the impact of
   these disturbances on soil characteristics that are likely to impact on
   vegetation, including total P, pH, water retention capacity, organic
   matter content and electrical conductivity. The disturbance types were:
   (i) land use incorporating clearing, agriculture and grazing by stock;
   (ii) creeks draining a developed catchment; and (iii) roads. Remnants
   that had been cleared and grazed had higher exotic and lower native
   species richness and cover than all other disturbance types. Areas that
   had been grazed but not cleared did not have more exotic species
   richness or cover than uncleared/ungrazed areas, thus retaining high
   conservation value. Areas within 2 m of a creek edge had higher exotic
   species richness and cover than areas further from the creek edge. Areas
   downslope of sealed roads had significantly higher exotic species
   richness and cover than areas below unsealed roads. No single soil
   attribute or combination of soil attributes was consistently able to
   account for variation in exotic species cover under the different
   disturbance types. Thus it appears that other factors such as site
   history and propagule pressure may be more important in determining
   exotic species success than soil characteristics alone, in this
   vegetation community.}},

Abstract = {{Surrogate taxa as indicators for biodiversity are widely used in
   conservation biology and ecology. However, available studies on the
   congruence of species diversity patterns in different taxa yielded
   inconsistent results, and correlations between taxa were few. To
   conserve or restore biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, knowledge
   on the response of different taxa to management regimes is crucial. In
   the present study we evaluated the congruence of diversity and
   similarity patterns among three insect taxa, i.e., bees, grasshoppers,
   and aculeate wasps, in a mosaic landscape in the Swiss Alps comprising
   extensively used grassland under different management regimes. In
   addition, we studied the influence of land use on the diversity and
   species composition of the three taxa. While species numbers were not
   significantly correlated between any pair of taxa, community
   similarities were positively correlated between bees and grasshoppers.
   The number of red-listed species was not correlated with the total
   number of species in bees and in grasshoppers. None of the investigated
   taxa reflected the species numbers or community similarities of the
   other taxa well enough to qualify as a general indicator for
   biodiversity. Remarkably, land use clearly influenced species
   composition, while its effect on species numbers was not significant.
   All management regimes of the grassland in the study area contribute
   substantially to the overall diversity of the three insect taxa.
   Conserving the variety of agricultural land uses will be the most
   promising step towards the conservation of biodiversity in the study
   area. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aim To determine the environmental factors associated with bryophyte
   diversity in remnants in a fragmented, agricultural landscape.
   Location Eighty-two remnants of tussock grassland, eucalypt woodland and
   eucalypt forest in the subhumid Midlands region of Tasmania, Australia.
   Methods Remnants were surveyed for bryophytes and predictor variables,
   such as vascular plant cover, climate, and topography. Management
   histories for each remnant were compiled using both site observation and
   landowner surveys. Bryophyte cover, richness, and composition were
   related to the independent variables using simple correlation and
   general linear models.
   Results We found weak relationships between the dependent variables and
   the fragmentation variables (remnant area, remnant perimeter to area
   ratio, distance to nearest remnant, distance to nearest larger remnant,
   and remnant age). Instead, climatic variables were important in
   predicting bryophytes, in particular those affecting humidity (minimum
   temperature of the coldest month, precipitation). Despite extensive
   sheep grazing in this landscape, grazing was not correlated with
   bryophyte diversity. Bryophyte diversity was not explained by vascular
   plant richness and was only weakly explained by composition, but was
   predicted by the cover of vascular plants. There was greater bryophyte
   cover and richness and different composition where the cover of native
   vascular plants was lower.
   Main conclusions The implications of our results are that all remnants,
   regardless of area, age and isolation, appear to be valuable for
   bryophyte conservation in this highly altered landscape. Our results
   also suggest that the cover of the vascular plant community, rather than
   its diversity, holds promise as a guide to bryophyte diversity.
   Bryophyte composition was similar between sites and a focus on the most
   species-rich sites may be the best conservation strategy in this
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper describes vegetation heterogeneity at contrasting
   spatial scales in order to analyse patterns of floristic diversity and
   vegetation-environment relations in the Flooding Pampa grasslands of
   Argentina. The overall grassland flora contains a large proportion of
   exotic species, which are mostly annual forbs. At a regional scale,
   there is a latitudinal turnover in relative abundance of major grass
   tribes, and C-3 grasses become increasingly common in grasslands at
   higher latitudes. The principal gradients in overall vegetation
   composition were associated with landscape-level changes in topography
   and soil chemistry. Both native and exotic species richness increased
   with topographic elevation, and markedly decreased in flood-prone
   habitats with acidic or saline soils. In remnants of tussock grassland,
   the predominant physiognomy of the Pampas in pre-settlement times, the
   presence of the tall native grass Paspalum quadrifarium is a strong
   determinant of local community structure, reducing the percentage of
   exotic species. Heterogeneity analysis at the community scale revealed a
   fine-grained species packing that was in sharp contrast with spatial
   mosaics observed in other grasslands under livestock grazing. At this
   scale, spatial variation in floristic composition correlated with
   changes in various soil parameters, but not with subtle differences in
   topographic relief. The studied grasslands possess some unique features
   that contribute towards a better understanding of how current vegetation
   heterogeneity is controlled by historical, environmental and management
   factors.}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral imagery of the Konza Prairie Biological Station in
   northeastern Kansas was used to evaluate upwelling spectral radiance,
   prairie spectral reflectance and band ratios of each as potential
   indicators of vascular plant species richness in a mesic grassland. The
   extent to which spatial variability in these parameters related to plant
   species richness also was investigated. A 224 channel hyperspectral data
   cube acquired in June 2000 by the Airborne Visible and Infrared Imaging
   Spectrometer (AVIRIS) provided complete coverage of the 400-2500 nm
   range at approximately 10 run per channel. After band deletions
   accounted for detector overlap and strong atmospheric attenuation
   features, 176 bands were retained for analysis and spanned the 404-2400
   nm range. Prairie reflectance was estimated via radiative transfer
   modeling and scaling to a library spectrum of highway construction
   material. Data were sampled from pixels having a 19 m ground sample
   distance (GSD) to represent each of 93 vegetation sampling transects.
   Reflectance and radiance at mid-infrared wavelengths (e.g., 1553 nm),
   and band ratios that were based on atmospheric windows in the red,
   near-infrared and mid-infrared spectra estimated species richness to
   within 6 to 7 species per transect. The 856 to 780 nm radiance or
   reflectance ratio yielded maximum adjusted coefficients of determination
   (r(2)) of approximately 0.4 in regressions with richness when data from
   bison-grazed and ungrazed areas were combined. These regressions
   remained significant (p <= 0.001) when only ungrazed areas were assessed
   although r(2) reduced to approximately 0.2. Richness was related
   significantly also to the 433 to 674 nm reflectance ratio for
   grazed-plus-ungrazed and ungrazed-only areas. In contrast, the
   effectiveness of the 433 to 674 nm radiance ratio was reduced by
   atmospheric backscatter. Species richness did not correlate strongly or
   consistently with transect spatial variability (coefficient of variation
   or range) in radiance, reflectance or band ratio value, apparently as a
   consequence of the relatively small area sampled for each transect
   (approximately 0.5 ha). Relationships between richness and prairie
   spectral features were explained by the influence of soil exposure on
   both parameters. Richness and estimated soil exposure tended to increase
   from ungrazed lowlands, to ungrazed slopes, to ungrazed uplands to
   grazed areas. Remotely sensed estimates of soil exposure may be
   particularly useful in addressing plant species richness on grazed
   grasslands owing to an overall similarity in spectral reflectance among
   dominant plant species. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews recent work carried out by the Institute of Grassland

   diversity and the abundance of positive indicator species of nature
   conservation value over a 5-year period and also enhanced faunal
   diversity and abundance reflecting improvements in spatial,
   architectural and temporal structure. However, there was no enhancement
   in positive indicator species and there was also an increase in
   pernicious weeds suggesting that grazing alone may not surface to
   deliver all the biodiversity goals for these grasslands and that
   additional management interventions may be required. For species-poor
   grassland, results indicate that distinctive differences in structure
   can lead to differences in faunal diversity. There is also some

Abstract = {{Recent changes in agriculture (intensification or abandonment) have
   resulted in a critical reduction of steppe-like grasslands in Eastern
   Europe. These grasslands harbor an extraordinarily high diversity of
   plants and invertebrates, including endemics, and are considered refugia
   for numerous threatened open-land species. We examined species richness,
   and abundance, proportion of open-land, endemic and threatened vascular
   plants, gastropods, and diurnal and nocturnal Lepidoptera in six
   different vegetation types all originating from steppe-like grasslands
   in Transylvania, Romania. Vegetation types included extensively grazed
   pastures (initial stage), three seral stages of succession (early stage
   of abandoned grassland, abandoned grassland with shrubs, and mature
   forest), and two human-made grassland alterations, namely abandoned
   vineyards and Pinus plantations. A total of 852 species (291 vascular
   plants, 24 gastropods, 129 diurnal and 408 nocturnal Lepidoptera) were
   found in the 22 study sites. The four taxonomic groups differed in their
   response to the abandonment of steppe-like grassland, except that
   species richness of plants and diurnal Lepidoptera were positively
   correlated. The complementarity of species composition increased with
   successional age in all taxonomic groups examined. The number of
   characteristic open-land species decreased with successional age in
   plants and gastropods. All investigated vegetation types harbored
   threatened (red-listed) species. Endemic species were found in all
   vegetation types except mature forests and Pinus plantations. All
   Transylvanian endemics and the majority of threatened species found were
   open-land species. Extensively cultivated vineyards, which have been
   abandoned for two to three decades, also maintained high plant and
   invertebrate diversities, comparable to those of the corresponding
   stages of grassland succession. In contrast, Pinus plantations (a recent
   grassland alteration) have changed habitat quality and will have a
   devastating effect on the unique, indigenous diversity of these
   steppe-like grasslands as soon as the canopy closes. To prevent losses
   of characteristic species, we suggest a rotational grassland management
   program that maintains different seral stages. Succession to mature
   forest and additional Pinus plantations should be prevented.}},

Abstract = {{Cattle are usually thought of as a threat to biodiversity. In regions
   threatened by exotic species invasion and lacking native wild grazers,
   however, cattle may produce the type of disturbance that helps maintain
   diverse communities. Across 72 vernal pools, I examined the effect of
   different grazing treatments (ungrazed, continuously grazed, wet-season
   grazed and dry-season grazed) on vernal-pool plant and aquatic faunal
   diversity in the Central Valley of California. After 3 years of
   treatment, ungrazed pools had 88\% higher-cover of exotic annual grasses
   and 47\% lower relative cover of native species than pools grazed at
   historical levels (continuously grazed). Species richness of native
   plants declined by 25\% and aquatic invertebrate richness was 28\% lower
   in the ungrazed compared with the continuously grazed treatments.
   Release from grazing reduced pool inundation period by 50 to 80\%,
   making it difficult for some vernal-pool endemic species to complete
   their life cycle. My results show that one should not assume livestock
   and ranching operations are necessarily damaging to native communities.
   In my central California study site, grazing helped maintain native
   plant and aquatic diversity in vernal pools.}},

Abstract = {{Comparisons between how bison and cattle grazing affect the plant
   community are understood poorly because of confounding differences in
   how the herbivores are typically managed. This 10-year study compared
   vegetation changes in Kansas (USA) tallgrass prairie that was burned and
   grazed season-long at a moderate stocking rate by either bison or
   cattle. We held management practices constant between the herbivores and
   equalized grazing pressure by matching animals so that the total body
   mass in all pastures was similar each year. Trends in species cover and
   diversity indices in the bison and cattle pastures were compared with
   ungrazed prairie that also was burned annually. We found that little
   bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) cover decreased over time in bison
   pastures, and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii) cover increased over
   time in cattle pastures. Grazing by either herbivore increased the
   canopy cover of annual forbs, perennial forbs, and cool-season
   graminoids, but both annual and perennial forb cover increased at a
   greater rate in bison pastures than in cattle pastures. Missouri
   goldenrod (Solidago missouriensis) and heath aster (Symphyotrichum
   ericoides) were primarily responsible for the increased forb cover in
   grazed pastures. Species richness at both small (10 m(2)) and large (200
   m(2)) spatial scales increased at a greater rate in bison pastures than
   in cattle pastures, but richness did not change through time in ungrazed
   prairie. The number of annual forb species was significantly higher in
   bison pastures than in pastures grazed by cattle. Residual graminoid
   biomass at the end of the grazing season was lower in bison pastures
   than in cattle pastures, whereas forb residuum increased over time at a
   greater rate in pastures grazed by bison than in pastures grazed by
   cattle. Although bison and cattle differentially altered some vegetation
   components, the plant communities in bison and cattle pastures were 85\%
   similar after 10 years of grazing. We conclude that most measurable
   differences between bison-grazed and cattle-grazed pastures in tallgrass
   prairie are relatively minor, and differences in how the herbivores are
   typically managed may play a larger role in their impact on prairie
   vegetation than differences between the species.}},

Abstract = {{Roadless habitats are commonly found to be less invaded than habitats
   near roads, but few studies have tested whether this pattern is due to
   propagule limitation or to greater invasion resistance of roadless
   sites. We examined reasons for the lower frequency and cover of yellow
   starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis) in grassland sites > 1000 m vs. 10
   m from roads in an inland California, USA, foothill landscape. During
   winter 2001 and 2002, we planted 100 Centaurea seeds in 64 pairs of 30 x
   30 cm plots (uncleared and cleared of aboveground plant material) at
   sites stratified by distance from roads (10 m and > 1000 m), soil type
   (nonserpentine and serpentine), and aspect (cool, warm, and neutral
   slopes). In nonserpentine grasslands, Centaurea survival was greater in
   uncleared (but not cleared) near (10 m) plots than in distant (> 1000 m)
   plots. These findings suggest that the effect of distance from roads on
   survival corresponds with higher aboveground biotic resistance in
   distant sites than in near sites. Centaurea biomass was greater in near
   than in distant plots (both uncleared and cleared) on nonserpentine
   soil, suggesting that either abiotic resistance or below ground biotic
   resistance could limit its growth in distant sites. These distance
   effects were no longer significant in models that included two biotic
   covariates: native grass cover (which was higher in distant sites and
   negatively correlated with Centaurea performance) and bare ground (which
   was lower in distant sites and positively correlated with Centaurea
   performance). On serpentine soil, there was no effect of road proximity
   on the performance of planted Centaurea. Our results suggest that
   Centaurea seeds can germinate in nonserpentine and serpentine grasslands
   regardless of distance from roads. Beyond the seedling stage, however,
   biotic resistance associated with higher native grass cover and lower
   levels of disturbance may inhibit Centaurea invasion of nonserpentine
   grassland sites-that are distant from roads.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. In the face of large-scale environmental changes, predicting the
   consequences for species composition from species' traits can be a major
   step towards generalizing ecological patterns and management. Few
   studies, however, have explored the applicability of this tool in
   relation to different climatic conditions. Here, the changes in species
   composition along a gradient of sheep-grazing pressure (high, low,
   abandonment) were used to test whether a common set of plant functional
   traits (PFT) would provide consistent predictions of species' responses
   to grazing in different biogeographical regions.
   2. Data were collected across an altitudinal and climatic gradient from
   Mediterranean rangelands to subalpine grasslands in north-eastern Spain.
   Species' responses were calculated using partial constrained ordination
   to account only for the effect of grazing intensity. Regression trees
   and general linear models were applied to identify traits that could
   predict species' responses.
   3. Results were mostly consistent with the ruderal vs. competitive
   strategy (sensu Grime), in terms of life cycle, life form and plant
   height, and their expected responses to repeated disturbance.
   4. However, the predictive capacity of the investigated traits changed
   with climatic conditions. Traits generally related to grazing did not
   show a strong repeatability across the climatic gradient. Convergent
   selection of climatic conditions and grazing indicated that plant
   features might reflect an adaptation to multiple selective forces. The
   climatic conditions acted as filters on the pool of PFT available and
   shifted the relevance of plant traits as potential predictors. Results
   were not substantially different after applying phylogenetically
   independent contrasts (PIC).
   5. Synthesis and applications. At a local scale, plant functional traits
   are useful tools in predicting species' responses to grazing and, for
   conservation purposes, identifying species vulnerable to land-use
   changes. However, predictions cannot be extrapolated from one climatic
   region to another. The methodology proposed in this study to detect
   predicting traits can be applied more generally. Regression trees, in
   particular, appear to be a useful tool because they account for
   non-additive effects and allow visualizations of trait combinations.}},

Abstract = {{1. Biodiversity conservation of grasslands in the face of transformation
   and global climate change will depend mainly on rangelands because of
   insufficient conservation areas in regions suited to agriculture.
   Transformed vegetation (pastures, crops and plantations) is not expected
   to conserve much biodiversity. This study examined the impact of land
   use on the plant diversity and community composition of the southern
   Drakensberg grasslands in South Africa, which are threatened with
   complete transformation to pastures, crops and plantations.
   2. The main land uses in this high rainfall region are: ranching or
   dairy production under private tenure using indigenous grassland,
   pastures (Eragrostis curvula, kikuyu and ryegrass) and maize; plantation
   forestry; communal tenure (maize and rangelands); and conservation.
   3. Plant diversity and composition were assessed using Whittaker plots.
   Transformed cover types were depauperate in species and ranged from
   kikuyu (1.4 species m(-2)) and ryegrass (2.9), to pine plantation (3.1),
   E. curvula pasture (3.1), commercial maize (3.2) and communal maize
   (7.8). With the exception of pine plantations, these communities
   supported mostly exotic (50 of 70 species) or ruderal indigenous species
   and made little contribution to plant species conservation. Abandoned
   communal cropland reverted to an indigenous grassland almost devoid of
   exotic species within c. 20 years.
   4. It was predicted that frequently cultivated sites (maize and
   ryegrass) would support less diversity than long-lived pastures (kikuyu
   and E. curvula). This was contradicted by the relatively high species
   diversity of communal maize fields, which was attributed to a lack of
   herbicides, and the depauperate communities of kikuyu and of E. curvula
   pasture, which were attributed, respectively, to a dense growth form and
   a severe mowing regime.
   5. Pine plantations harboured fourfold more indigenous species per plot
   (27) than other transformed types. Species were mostly shade-tolerant
   grassland relics that had persisted for 12 years since planting, and
   some forest colonizers. Indigenous species were unlikely to be
   maintained because of aggressive invasion by the exotic Rubus
   cuneifolius and severe disturbance associated with tree harvest and
   replanting.
   6. The richness of indigenous grasslands was expected to differ in
   response to grazing pressure but they differed only in composition.
   Grasslands were dominated by grasses, despite the richness of herbaceous
   species. The dominance of Themeda triandra was reduced under livestock
   grazing in favour of more grazing-tolerant species. Exotic species were
   inconspicuous except for the dicotyledon Richardia brasiliensis, a
   subdominant under communal grazing.
   7. Southern Drakensberg grasslands are probably now stocked with
   livestock six- to 35-fold higher than during pre-settlement times. A
   grassland protected for c. 50 years supported twofold greater richness
   (101 species plot(-1)) than grazed grasslands, suggesting that a
   150-year history of increased mammalian grazing had already reduced
   plant diversity.
   8. Synthesis and applications. Land acquisition is costly, thus
   conservation of plant diversity in the southern Drakensberg requires a
   policy that inhibits transformation of rangelands. This can be achieved
   by enhancing their economic viability without changing the vegetation
   composition. Their inherent value must be recognized, such as for water
   production. The viability of commercial ranches can be improved by
   increasing their size. Conservation efforts need to be focused on plant
   taxa that only occur on unprotected rangelands.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Monocot and dicot perennial herbaceous species can be
   considered two a priori guilds, which interact in regularly mown
   grasslands. Complementary resource use in space is important for
   diversity and productivity of perennial herbaceous communities, yet
   small-scale spatial patterns of guilds and niche complementarity have
   rarely been linked explicitly. We ask: 1. Do guild interactions in our
   community generate small-scale patterns such as guild proportionality?
   2. Do these patterns coincide with overyielding of guilds, that is, can
   small-scale spatial patterns of guilds be experimentally linked to niche
   complementarity?
   Location: Georgia, central Caucasian mountains.
   Methods: We sampled randomly placed small quadrats and used
   presence-absence data to measure small-scale spatial patterns within
   plots. We experimentally tested overyielding of monocots and dicots
   grown separately and in mixtures.
   Results: We found measurable small-scale pattern of guilds in our
   community: monocots and dicots showed significant guild proportionality.
   However, variance deficit in the number of species per small quadrat was
   stronger in monocots than in dicots. Experiments found considerable
   overyielding, which was unaffected by water stress.
   Conclusions: Coincidence of measurable small-scale arrangements of
   guilds with robust overyielding indicates that spatial arrangement is an
   important manifestation of niche complementarity. Stronger variance
   deficit of monocot species at small scale suggests that monocots compete
   with each other more strongly and, as a consequence, are more regularly
   dispersed at small spatial scale. Conversely, morphologically more
   diverse and more plastic dicots may more easily fit within the
   neighbourhood patchwork created by monocots.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment commenced in 1998 to test the effects of superphosphate
   fertiliser application and grazing on production and botanical
   composition of a native grassland in south-eastern Australia.
   Superphosphate application resulted in an increase in sheep production
   but a decline in native perennial grasses and an increase in exotic
   annual grasses. The study reported here aimed to determine if arthropod
   assemblages showed changes in community composition on the same
   experimental plots. The experiment was conducted in grassland dominated
   by the native perennial wallaby grass, Austrodanthonia duttoniana, and
   consisted of six replicated treatments that were designed to improve
   grassland and domestic livestock productivity. Treatments consisted of a
   control (no fertiliser), three levels of annually applied superphosphate
   (62.5, 125, and 250 kg ha(-1)), and two treatments aimed to raise soil
   pH (superphosphate plus lime, and sewage ash). Soil properties were
   measured annually and sheep stocking rates were increased over the
   duration of the experiment according to increases in available forage.
   Soil and ground-active arthropod populations were sampled from all plots
   in spring 2001. Fertiliser application and grazing increased the
   relative abundance of introduced Acari and Collembola, and changed the
   community composition of Formicidae and Coleoptera. Lime and sewage
   treatments had variable effects on taxa. Improving the productivity of
   native grassland with superphosphate led to a decline in plant and
   arthropod biodiversity through reduced abundance and/or local extinction
   of native species and increased dominance of introduced species. These
   findings support the need to protect and restore a representative
   network of native grassland ecosystems within the agricultural zone of
   south-eastern Australia. Crown Copyright (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Some producers believe that planting pastures to several forage species
   benefits sustainability of grazing systems. We conducted a grazing study
   to determine if forage species diversity in pastures affects herbage
   productivity and weed invasion. One-hectare pastures were planted to
   four mixtures in August 2001 and then grazed with lactating dairy cattle
   during 2002 and 2003. The mixtures were two species {[}orchardgrass
   (Dactylis glomerata L.) and white clover (Trifolium repens L.)], three
   species {[}orchardgrass, white clover, and chicory (Cichorium intybus
   L.)], six species {[}orchardgrass, tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea
   Schreb.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), red clover (Trifolium
   pratense L.), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), and chicory],
   and nine species {[}the six-species mixture plus white clover, alfalfa
   (Medicago sativa L.), and bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.)]. When rainfall
   was plentiful (2003), there were no differences in herbage yield among
   the mixtures; all averaged 9800 kg ha(-1) dry matter. During 2002, which
   was dry, the two-species mixture produced less herbage than the other
   mixtures (4800 vs. 7600 kg ha(-1) dry matter). The proportion of nonsown
   species in the sward was lower for the six- and nine-species mixtures
   than the two-and three-species mixtures, indicating less weed invasion
   for these complex mixtures. Red clover and chicory proportions decreased
   by 80\% after 2 yr, and orchardgrass dominated in all pastures by May
   2004. We conclude that planting a mixture of grasses, legumes, and
   chicory will benefit herbage production during dry years and will reduce
   weed invasion for a few years after planting under management similar to
   ours. Producers would have to reestablish the chicory and legume
   components relatively frequently to maintain these benefits.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated what factors lead to invasion of exotics or
   re-colonization of native perennial grasses in the South Australian
   mid-north grasslands. We manipulated 160 experimental quadrats by
   clipping, irrigation and seed addition and assessed recruitment by
   exotics in an area dominated by perennial grasses and perennial grass
   recruitment in an area dominated by exotics. Treatment effects differed
   with season for exotics: their biomass increased with irrigation in
   autumn and seed addition in winter. However, in both periods other
   factors, probably soil properties, also had a strong effect. We detected
   no perennial grass seedlings in the quadrats over 1 year, possibly due
   to unsuitable environmental conditions or persistent high competition
   levels. Under controlled conditions the presence of the invasive annual
   Avena barbata had a strong negative effect on the recruitment of the
   native perennial Austrodanthonia caespitosa at any moisture and nutrient
   availability. Avena also germinated faster and more frequently than
   Austrodanthonia, especially at low soil moisture. During an imposed
   drought Austrodanthonia seedlings survived longer in the absence of
   Avena. The results suggest that annual exotics are highly responsive to
   resources and can quickly invade areas, while the re-colonization of
   invaded areas by native grasses requires a complex (and less likely)
   rainfall regime.}},

Abstract = {{Calcareous grasslands are an important habitat for floral and faunal
   communities in the UK and Europe. Declines due to changes in management,
   scrub invasion and agricultural improvement have left much of the
   remnants of this habitat in a degraded and fragmented state. Grazing, by
   cattle or sheep, is one of the main management practices used to
   maintain and improve the floral and faunal quality of calcareous
   grassland. The long-term impacts of different grazing regimes, however,
   are poorly understood, particularly in terms of the invertebrate
   communities. This study contrasted the impacts of recently introduced
   and long-term sheep or cattle grazing on beetle communities present on
   one of the largest areas of calcareous grassland in Europe, the
   Salisbury Plain military training Area, UK. No effects of grazing
   management on beetle abundance, species. richness or evenness were
   found, but plant diversity and overall percentage cover of grasses did
   influence beetle diversity. Proportions of the total number of
   individuals and overall species richness within beetle guilds
   (predatory, phytophagous, flower/seed feeders, root feeders and foliage
   feeders) were strongly influenced by both the duration and type of
   grazing animal. At the species level, beetle community structure showed
   significant differences between ungrazed, long-term cattle and long-term
   sheep grazing treatments. Changes in plant community structure were
   found to influence beetle community structure. The significance of these
   results is discussed in terms of the long-term impacts of grazing on
   beetle community structure, and the benefits of different grazing
   regimes for the conservation management of calcareous grasslands. (c)

Abstract = {{The potential environmental effects of livestock farming are mainly
   associated with intensification of poultry, pig and dairy cow production
   systems. The major impacts are mainly caused by housing of livestock,
   which can lead to air and water pollution associated with nitrogen and
   phosphorus emissions and losses from manure. European countries regulate
   the potential for these types of pollution through a number of
   mechanisms, which have received wide public acceptance. In grazing
   systems, nitrogen pollution, associated with the use of nitrogen
   fertilizer, is also the subject of legislation. Perhaps because of this
   regulatory approach, surveys of the public have found that human food
   quality and animal welfare are more important issues than effects on air
   and water quality when considering livestock systems.
   Variation in stocking rates of grazing ruminants can change the
   structure and composition of pastures with potential impacts on
   biodiversity and the production of methane, a greenhouse gas. In
   European countries, maximum stocking rates have been set to reduce these
   impacts. Surveys of the European public have suggested that they are
   willing to pay for the mitigation of these environmental effects but
   that they also value strongly the cultural component of grazed livestock
   systems. There are few underlying concepts about how society views the
   environmental impacts of livestock systems. These are used to conclude
   that current attitudes are likely to prevail in the next decade. (c)

Abstract = {{French wet grasslands support important populations of lapwings and
   other waders. Grazing management is a key issue in the use of grasslands
   by these birds since they are very sensitive to sward structure (height
   and heterogeneity). To assess the impact of different grazing regimes on
   sward structure during spring, sward height was repeatedly measured in a
   coastal marsh for 2 years. Sward structure was characterised by
   variables related to height classes and an index of heterogeneity.
   Grazing regimes were described by stocking rates per period and N
   fertilisation level. Heterogeneity index was quadratically related to
   mean sward height both years. Four types of sward structures were
   characterised through principal component analysis. Coinertia analysis
   showed a strong relationship between grazing regimes and sward
   structure. However, during spring, the relationship between stocking
   rate and sward structure differed according to year, impact of grazing
   being greater during drought year. Suitable sward structures were
   observed for both lapwings and redshanks. Wader habitat management
   through grazing calls for more attention to be paid to the delayed
   effects of autumn and winter grazing regimes. Sward heterogeneity
   emerges as a new characteristic to control, because it may introduce new
   constraints for livestock production. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We studied an alpine herbivory gradient established by collared pikas, a
   small central place foraging lagomorph, to examine the effects of
   multiple grazing levels on above-ground live biomass (AGB) and species
   richness (SR) in alpine tundra. The effects of within-season (four
   sampling periods), multi-season (across three summers) and longer-term
   dynamics (inferred from spatial location of vegetation with respect to
   pika haypiles) were examined. Along the grazing gradient, we found
   support for and against hypotheses that propose biphasic, increasing, or
   decreasing responses to herbivory, both in terms of AGB and SR. Our
   results suggest that plant-herbivore predictability is still weak. To
   further examine the impact of herbivory, we experimentally removed pikas
   using mesh exclosures placed at increasing distance from the edge of
   talus occupied by pikas. AGB after the second consecutive year of
   herbivore exclusion increased by 125\% compared to control plots in
   highly grazed areas adjacent to talus ( <1 m). In more lightly grazed
   sites at distances 1-6 in from talus, AGB increased by more than 40\%
   after pikas were removed. No differences were observed in the ungrazed
   sites > 6 in from talus. AGB was highest in meadow patches previously
   grazed by pikas compared to those with little grazing history, but this
   response was only observed after two seasons following release from
   herbivory. Grazed sites at distances of 1-6 m had the highest SR. These
   results indicate that multi-year measurements of growth are particularly
   relevant in ecosystems dominated by long-lived perennials in regions
   where productivity is low. Infrequent herbivore vacancies may provide
   local short-term release from pika grazing, thereby contributing to the
   persistence of productive, highly palatable vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The cover of Festuca gracillima (coiron fueguino), a native tussock
   grass that dominates grass steppes of Southern Patagonia and Tierra del
   Fuego, has diminished under continuous sheep grazing. This loss is a
   concern, because it also reduces forage availability in winter,
   biodiversity, and soil stability. In the present study, the hypothesis
   that tussock grass birth and mortality rates are balanced only under
   moderate-grazing or exclusion regimes was tested with two 5-year records
   of demographic data obtained from 3 sheep grazing regimes: exclosure (no
   grazing), low (0.0348 AU center dot ha(-1)center dot y(-1) where AU
   represents animal units equivalent to the consumption of a 450-kg cow),
   and high (0.1043 AU center dot ha(-1)center dot y(-1)). Tussocks were
   outlined in photographs and marked in the field at two 5-year intervals.
   The initial total number of plants for the 3 grazing regimes (n = 358)
   increased to 384 plants at the end of the 10-year period. No recruitment
   from seed was observed; plant number changed as a balance of yearly
   rates of tussock mortality (1.48\%), amalgamation (0.75\%), and
   subdivision (2.04\%). Intensely grazed populations showed greater
   (2.13\%) mortality rates than ungrazed (1.20\%) or moderately grazed
   (0.78\%) populations. Tussocks in intensely grazed populations were
   smaller (167 cm(2)center dot plant(-1)) than those in moderately grazed
   (197 cm(2)center dot plant(-1)) or ungrazed (300 cm(2)center dot
   plant(-1)) populations. Transition matrices showed eigenvalues of 0.701
   (high grazing), 0.794 (exclosure), and 0.876 (low grazing). All growth
   rates of demographic models were negative; the largest rate of
   population decrease was found under high-intensity grazing, for which
   projections show that half the tussocks would be lost in 37 years. Under
   low-intensity grazing and exclosure, a similar tussock loss would take
   place in 87 and 74 years, respectively. Results show 1) the importance
   of vegetative processes for tussock demography, 2) the extremely slow
   dynamics of population changes, and 3) that tussocks may suffer
   increased mortality as a consequence of subdivision or fragmentation, a
   process that can be viewed as a small-scale example of the generalized
   effect of patch subdivision under grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Prescribed burning is an important tool for managing and restoring
   prairies and other ecosystems. One effect of fire is plant litter
   removal, which can influence seedling establishment. Four experimental
   treatments (burned, clipped and raked to remove litter, burned with
   litter reapplied, and unmanipulated) were applied to 2 X 2.5-m plots in
   three western Oregon, United States, upland prairies to determine how
   burning affects seedling establishment. Seeds of common exotic and
   native prairie species were sowed into the experimental plots after
   treatments. Seedlings were censused the following spring. The experiment
   was repeated on each of the three sites, representing three common types
   of prairie vegetation: an Annual Exotic Grass site, a Perennial Exotic
   Grass site, and a Native Bunchgrass site. In both the Annual Exotic
   Grass and the Perennial Exotic Grass sites, burning significantly
   improved native, but not exotic, seedling establishment over those on
   unburned plots. Litter removal was a significant component of this burn
   effect, particularly on the Perennial Exotic Grass site. In these
   winter-moist systems, the net effect of litter is to inhibit seedling
   establishment. Burning treatments on the Native Bunchgrass site
   significantly increased seedling establishment only of short-lived
   exotic species. These results suggest that in prairie ecosystems similar
   to the Annual and Perennial Exotic Grass sites, prescribed burning
   followed by sowing native seeds can be an effective restoration
   technique. Burning alone or sowing alone would be counter-productive, in
   the first case because increased establishment would come from exotic
   species and in the second case because establishment rates are low in

Abstract = {{The characteristic vegetation of Mediterranean seasonal oligotrophic
   pools is dominated by aquatic and amphibious annual plant species.
   Temporary flooded pools in southern France have experienced during the
   last decades a progressive decline of grazing, notably by sheep,
   favouring the encroachment of shrubs (Ulmus minor and Fraxinus
   angustifolia). A major consequence of this colonisation is the
   regression of the aquatic and amphibious annual plant species, resulting
   from shading by dominant vegetation and from litter accumulation. A
   restoration experiment has been established on 6 pools in southern
   France testing the impact of shrub clearing on vegetation dynamics. The
   objective of this project was to evaluate the feasibility of the
   restoration of the community dominated by aquatic and amphibious annuals
   and to identify indicators for success (restoration of the target
   vegetation). This project hypothesized that recruitment from seed bank
   is the dominant mechanism for regeneration and that seed bank of the
   target species persisted in shrub-dominated areas of the pools. The seed
   bank was analysed by the germination method. Our analysis showed that
   seed banks for the annual amphibious and aquatic species were present in
   shrub dominated areas of the pools. Shrub clearing was followed in 2
   pools by a significant increase in the richness of the vegetation in
   aquatic annual species. Among the other 4 pools the abundance of
   perennial herbaceous species and of annual terrestrial species were
   significantly negatively correlated with the number of aquatic annual
   species. Preliminary indicators for the success of restoration by shrub
   clearing are proposed based on existing vegetation, seed banks and
   hydrology. The importance of perennial grasses suggest that grazing
   combined with shrub clearing should achieve better results for the
   restoration of these annual dominated temporary pools.}},

Abstract = {{Partial harvesting of forest for biofuel and other products may be less
   harmful to biodiversity than clear-cutting, and may even be beneficial
   for some species or groups of organisms such as herbs. There are,
   however, few well-controlled experiments evaluating positive and
   negative effects, such as species losses directly after harvest. In
   closed canopy mixed oak forest in Sweden, about 25\% of the tree basal
   area and 50-90\% of the understory was removed (mainly spruce, birch,
   aspen, lime, rowan and hazel). In each of six forests, we studied herbs
   in an experimental (cutting) plot and a control plot (undisturbed)
   before, and in the first summer, after the harvest (conducted in
   winter). Losses of species were similar in experimental and control
   plots (15-16\%). The harvest increased species richness by 4-31\% (mean
   18\%); also species diversity (H) increased. Several ruderals increased
   in experimental plots, but most changes occurred in grassland and forest
   species; partial cutting led to complex, partly unpredictable early
   changes in the herb community. A review of early effects of partial
   cutting (eight experiments) indicated that it increases herb species
   richness in stands of broadleaves, but apparently not in conifer stands;
   there was no evidence that partial cutting increases species losses.
   Thus, with respect to early changes after harvest, we found no negative
   effects of partial cutting on herbs. We suggest, however, that some
   proportion of closed-canopy mixed oak forest should not be harvested, to
   protect rare, potentially sensitive herbs, and to create stand
   diversity. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the multi-scale effects of farmland management on
   the assemblages of grassland wintering birds in Southern Portugal,
   evaluating the potential influences on bird conservation of ongoing
   transformations in agricultural landscapes. The bird assemblages of 42
   grassland fields were characterised and related to three sets of
   variables reflecting field management, landscape context and large-scale
   spatial trends. Birds showed responses to the three sets of variables,
   with variation partitioning indicating that species richness was
   primarily influenced by landscape context, whereas abundances were
   mostly determined by field management. In general, high species richness
   was associated with small patches of arable land, diverse landscapes,
   high stream density and forest and shrub cover, which probably acted as
   sources of non-agricultural species to grassland fields. In contrast,
   fields located in homogenous arable landscapes tended to be species
   poor, though they were the most favourable for open farmland species of
   conservation concern (e.g. skylark, calandra lark and little bustard).
   Old grazed fallows were generally associated with the highest abundances
   of both invertebrate and seed-eating birds, particularly that of winter
   visitors. Seed-eating winter visitors were also associated with stubble
   fields. The results indicated that conservation of Iberian grasslands
   for wintering birds requires management at both the landscape and field
   scales. At the landscape level, large blocks of open farmland habitat
   need to be maintained. At the field level, conservation management
   should strive to maintain both stubble fields and old grazed fallows.
   The application of such prescriptions would require a combination of
   agrienvironmental programs and land planning policies, whereby the
   financial support to individual farmers should be conditional on the
   maintenance of adequate landscape contexts at larger spatial scales. (c)

Abstract = {{Presence of higher plant species was recorded in 1455 permanently marked
   quadrats located across Britain in 1978, 1990 and 1998 in a stratified,
   random sample of 259 1 km squares. Significant increases and decreases
   in frequency of each species were summarised as changes in the
   representation of simple traits, each of which had an established
   relationship with varying levels of fertility or disturbance. By testing
   the null hypothesis that the trait values represented among increasing
   or decreasing species were a random draw from the 1978 species pool, we
   determined the consistency of botanical change with changes in land-use
   in different vegetation types and landscape locations across Britain.
   Overall, 63\% of significant changes in species occupancy were decreases
   and 37\% increases. Trait changes were largely consistent with the
   impact of increased nutrient availability across vegetation types
   associated with inherently low fertility, such as infertile grassland,
   heath, bog and moorland. Linear habitats in lowland Britain saw trait
   changes consistent with secondary succession. Although trait changes
   were highly consistent with eutrophication in upland vegetation, the
   identity of the changing species left open the possibility that
   increased N deposition, sheep grazing intensity and local improvement
   could all have played a part.
   Recent changes in common plant species across Britain suggest that
   objectives for large-scale restoration and maintenance of plant
   communities must address four problems: (a) the increasing scarcity of
   stress-tolerant species in lowland species pools, (b) exploitation and
   maintenance of species populations on habitat fragments and linear
   features in the lowlands, (c) the spread and persistence of generalist
   species in upland Britain, (d) systemic nutrient enrichment in both
   lowland and upland environments. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Arthropod abundance has been hypothesized to be correlated with plant
   diversity but the results of previous studies have been equivocal. In
   contrast, plant productivity, vegetation structure, abiotic site
   conditions, and the physical disturbance of habitats, are factors that
   interact with plant diversity, and that have been shown to influence
   arthropod abundance. We studied the combined effect of plant species
   diversity, productivity and site characteristics on arthropod abundance
   in 71 managed grasslands in central Germany using multivariate
   statistics. For each site we determined plant species cover, plant
   community biomass (productivity), macro- and micronutrients in the soil,
   and characterized the location of sites with respect to orographic
   parameters as well as the current and historic management regimes.
   Arthropods were sampled using a suction sampler and classified a priori
   into functional groups (FGs). We found that arthropod abundance was not
   correlated with plant species richness, effective diversity or Camargo's
   evenness, even when influences of environmental variables were taken
   into account. In contrast, plant community composition was highly
   correlated with arthropod abundances. Plant community productivity
   influenced arthropod abundance but explained only a small proportion of
   the variance. The abundances of the different arthropod FGs were
   influenced differentially by agricultural management, soil
   characteristics, vegetation structure and by interactions between
   different FGs of arthropods. Herbivores, carnivores and detritivores
   reacted differently to variation in environmental variables in a manner
   consistent with their feeding mode. Our results show that in natural
   grassland systems arthropod abundance is not a simple function of plant
   species richness, and they emphasize the important role of plant
   community composition for the abundance patterns of the arthropod
   assemblages.}},

Abstract = {{Question: What is the relative importance of area- and edge-effects on
   woody seedling diversity in old Afromontane forest fra-ments?
   Location: Mistbelt Afromontane forests, KwaZulu-Natal midlands, South
   Africa.
   Methods: Woody seedling abundance and species richness in 590 1-m(2)
   plots were sampled at the forest edge (< 10 m from the edge) and
   interior in 31 old (> 60 a) Afromontane forest fragments (0.05 - 328.5
   ha) with closed edges in an ancient grassland matrix.
   Results: Unlike young (< 20 a) Amazonian fragments, there was no edge-
   or area-effect on sample plot seedling density and species richness,
   although these increased significantly with increasing herb cover (less
   disturbance). Seedling density, but not species richness, declined
   significantly with herbivory of seedlings, regardless of forest size or
   plot location. Seedling community composition and richness did not
   differ significantly between the edge and interior of forests across the
   range of forest sizes (i.e. no edge-effect). Community composition was
   nested with small forests retaining a subset of the seedling flora of
   larger forests. Overall, cumulative seedling species richness increased
   with forest area (i.e. area-effect).
   Conclusions: Holocene climatic extinction filtering events and
   area-dependent species relaxation have potentially selected for tree
   species with convergent life histories adapted to local
   fragmentation-effects. Stable environmental conditions at old edges in
   these naturally fragmented forests cause similar regeneration conditions
   and seedling species composition between edge and interior.
   Consequently, seedling density and species richness are controlled more
   by response to gradients of local disturbance (habitat area, herb cover,
   herbivory) than by proximity to the edge. Large patches (> 50 ha) with
   intact edges had the highest tree seedling diversity and are a
   conservation priority. Although small patches contain no unique species
   they preserve landscape processes, have conservation value, and require
   protection. Conservation principles derived from recently created
   Amazonian fragments and that emphasize edge-effects, require critical
   evaluation for application to old Afromontane patches.}},

   km(2)) sheep densities in an alpine habitat of Norway (1050-1300 in
   a.s.l.). The increased vulnerability hypothesis (HI) predicts that the
   more folivorous invertebrates, the higher the grazing pressure by sheep,
   as large herbivore grazing may stress the plants so they are more
   vulnerable to insect herbivory. The increased defence hypothesis (H-2)
   predicts increased levels of general anti-herbivore defences, and thus a
   lower abundance of invertebrates with increasing sheep densities.
   Contrary to both predictions, no evidence was found that sheep grazing
   affected invertebrate richness, or abundance of folivorous, predatory or
   detritivore invertebrates - in a community dominated by Diptera and
   Hemiptera. Demonstrating an effect will always be a function of sample
   size, but at least our study shows that other environmental variables
   (such as plant species richness and functional plant richness) are more
   important determinants than sheep grazing for the selected invertebrate
   groups. Our study was short-term (first year of grazing) mainly designed
   to test specific hypotheses related to induced plant defences; long-term
   effects are probably owing to the impact sheep may have on vegetation
   composition, primary production, litter cover and soil properties.}},

Title = {{Local and regional processes in low-productive mountain plant
   communities: the roles of seed and microsite limitation in relation to

Abstract = {{It is becoming widely accepted that plant community structure is
   determined not only by local scale factors, but that regional factors
   may play considerable role. The research studying the associated
   processes in different environments with different species assemblages
   is still limited. We conducted a two-year seed sowing experiment to test
   whether a plant community in a low-productive mountain snowbed is
   limited by seed or microsite availability and how these variables depend
   on natural grazing. In a factorial design, half of the plots received a
   mixture of seeds of fourteen species naturally occurring at the study
   site and above ground biomass was removed from half of the plots. These
   treatments were applied to plots with long term grazer exclosures and to
   plots accessible to grazers. Both sowing and biomass removal increased
   the number of seedlings, the species richness of seedlings and total
   species richness. The number of seedlings was higher in open plots than
   in exclosures in the second year. Both seedling richness and total
   species richness were higher in open plots. Seedling recruitment was
   negatively related to the amount of above ground biomass and positively
   to the initial species richness. These results suggest that even fairly
   low-productive environments can be both seed and microsite limited and
   that these depend on grazing pressure. Natural grazing by mammal
   herbivores (e.g. lemmings and reindeer) favours species colonization and
   seedling emergence. Low-productive mountain snowbeds are prone to
   colonization from the local species pool and even high species richness
   may not constrain ingression of new species.}},
