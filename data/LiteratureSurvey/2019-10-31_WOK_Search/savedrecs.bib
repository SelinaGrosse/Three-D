Title = {{Breeding populations of a declining farmland bird are dependent on a
   burrowing, herbivorous ecosystem engineer}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{140}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In recent decades, numerous farmland birds have experienced considerable
   population declines. The loss of nutrient-poor habitats with short
   vegetation due to land-use intensification, abandonment or nitrogen
   deposition helps account for this decrease. Soil-disturbing ecosystem
   engineers can naturally create short and sparsely vegetated swards with
   beneficial effects for biodiversity.
   The aim of this study is to examine the influence of the European rabbit
   (Oryctolagus cuniculus) as an ecosystem engineer on breeding populations
   of the severely declining northern wheatear (Oenanthe oenanthe) on the
   East Frisian Islands (Lower Saxony, northern Germany). Rabbits were
   found to have had a considerable influence on the structure of the dune
   grassland, the main breeding habitat of the wheatear: high rabbit
   abundance resulted in greater burrow density and more bare ground.
   Wheatears were also more abundant on islands with larger rabbit
   populations. At the plot level, wheatear abundance increased with burrow
   density and the cover of potential foraging habitats (short vegetation).
   In addition, the likelihood of nest-building increased with burrow
   density and decreased with vegetation height.
   We thoroughly investigated the dependence of the northern wheatear on
   large populations of the ecosystem engineer European rabbit. Through
   their digging and grazing activities, rabbits create two key resources
   for breeding wheatears: (i) sufficient burrows as potential nesting
   sites and (ii) the availability of short vegetation as foraging
   habitats.}},

Title = {{Effects of different grazing intensities on the composition and

Volume = {{144}},

Abstract = {{Most studies evaluating the effects of grazing intensities on soils in
   Brazilian grasslands have focused on abiotic parameters, especially
   chemical or physical properties. In this context, soil arthropods have
   been largely unexplored, especially Collembola. This research addressed
   the effect of different grazing intensities on the composition and
   structure (abundance, richness, diversity, and evenness) of Collembola
   communities under different grazing intensity levels. Collembola were
   collected at different cattle grazing intensity level treatments (high,
   moderate, and low) in southern Brazilian native grasslands (also known
   as Campos). Our findings indicated significant changes in the
   composition of Collembola communities through grazing intensities. The
   treatment with the lowest grazing intensity was found to be
   substantially different from all others, probably because of a high
   abundance of some taxa (i.e. Entomobrya spp). We also observed that
   morphospecies richness and diversity tended to peak at moderate grazing
   intensities, whereas total abundance was higher in the lowest grazing
   intensity treatment. This study provides experimental evidence that
   disturbances caused by cattle grazing in native grasslands might impact
   soil faunal communities: increases in grazing intensity affected soil
   arthropod composition and structure by reducing their abundance,
   richness and diversity. It is important to highlight taxonomical
   richness and diversity as an intrinsic characteristic of communities
   insuring their functionality as a consequence of niche occupation and
   complementarity.}},

Title = {{Riparian forest recovery following a decade of cattle exclusion in the
   Colombian Andes}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{452}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{To meet their large-scale forest and landscape restoration targets,
   countries must find ways to accommodate areas for conservation alongside
   agricultural production. In some pasture-dominated regions of Latin
   America, intensive silvopastoral systems (SPS) are being promoted to
   increase cattle productivity on certain lands while facilitating the
   removal of cattle from marginal areas for forest restoration. However,
   the recovery of these forests and their contribution to the overall
   conservation value of the landscape has not been assessed rigorously. We
   evaluated forest structure and composition in 20 sites in a region of
   the Colombian Andes where a decade ago farmers transitioned to SPS and
   fenced off riparian areas to enable forest recovery. We compared these
   restored forests to a reference model based on the remaining riparian
   forest across the region, all of which has been subjected to human
   management. We found that woody species richness was higher in restored
   than in reference forests, and the proportion of large-seeded, later
   successional, animal-dispersed species were similar in both forest
   types. Whereas we found a similar suite of dominant tree species in
   restored and reference forest, Guadua angustifolia, a native giant
   bamboo was more abundant in the reference forests due to human
   management. Total tree basal area was higher in restored forests due to
   a small number of very large trees likely present in the pastures at the
   time of site protection. These findings highlight (1) the potential for
   recovery of diverse forests in riparian sites despite previous grazing
   use and (2) the role of remnant trees in facilitating natural
   succession. Overall, rapid forest recovery with minimal intervention in
   previously fanned lands is good news for conservation in a region that
   still harbors significant biodiversity despite high levels of
   fragmentation and the influence of human management.}},

Abstract = {{Plant populations can exhibit local adaptation to their abiotic
   environment, such as climate and soil properties, as well as biotic
   components such as the chemical signatures of dominant plant species and
   mutualistic and pathogenic microbial populations. While patterns of
   local adaptation in individual species are widely recorded, the
   importance of microevolutionary processes for plant community assembly
   and function is poorly understood. Here, we examined how a history of
   long-term co-existence, and thus potential for local co-adaptation,
   influenced the process of plant community assembly. Soil inocula and
   seeds of eight plant species were collected from three calcareous
   grasslands with a long history of grazing within a single geographical
   region. Mesocosm communities were established using local genotypes from
   a single site or an artificial mixture of genotypes from two different
   sites. To investigate the role of root exudates and local ('home') and
   non-local ('away') soil biota as mediators of plant species
   co-existence, the population origin treatment was combined with the
   addition of activated carbon, which is known to adsorb exudates from
   soil, and sterilization of soil inocula. Individual-, species- and
   mesocosm-level responses were measured over the course of three growing
   seasons. We found that root exudates promoted seedling survival, species
   co-existence and productivity in assemblages of genotypes originating
   from the same community but had a weak impact in mixed, novel
   communities. Soil biota promoted the growth of subordinate forbs and
   restrained the growth of dominant graminoids, particularly in
   communities composed of local genotypes. The effects of population
   origin were significant in the first 2 years of the experiment but were
   not detectable in the third year when interbreeding and new seedling
   establishment took place. Plant genotypes coupled with `home' microbial
   inoculum experienced a stronger reduction in growth compared with
   genotypes exposed to `away' inoculum, indicating that plants experienced
   home-field disadvantage in interactions with soil biota. Synthesis. Our
   study demonstrates that the mechanisms of initial grassland community
   assembly depend on community history, with below-ground chemical
   interactions and plant interactions with soil biota becoming stronger
   drivers of dynamics in established and potentially co-evolved
   communities.}},

Title = {{Microsymbionts of forage peanut under different soil and climate

Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{201-212}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The use of mixed pastures of grasses with forage peanut (Arachis pintoi)
   is growing and offers promising results. This leguminous forage plant
   has a stoloniferous growth habit and tolerates more intense defoliation
   and shading. However, there are few studies on its symbiosis with
   nitrogen (N-2) fixing bacteria and no studies on genetic identification
   of its native microsymbionts. The aim of this study was to evaluate
   phenotypic and genetic diversity and the symbiotic efficiency of
   bacterial strains isolated from nodules of forage peanut intercropped
   with grasses in pasture areas. Root nodules were collected from the
   Belomonte cultivar in Isabela, Bahia, and BRS Mandobi cultivar in
   Lavras, Minas Gerais, Brazil. The areas of sample collection had
   contrasting physical and chemical characteristics. Samples of 10 plants
   per area and 5 nodules per plant were taken. The strains isolated from
   the nodules were analyzed for culture characteristics (growth period and
   change in pH of the culture medium), their 16S rRNA, gyrB and nifH genes
   were partially sequenced, and authentication and analysis of symbiotic
   efficiency in forage peanut plants were carried out. Both the
   authentication and symbiotic efficiency experiments were carried out in
   a greenhouse under axenic conditions, using A. pintoi cv. BRS Mandobi in
   a completely randomized design with four replications. Authentication
   was performed in long neck bottles (500 mL) filled with nutrient
   solution, and symbiotic efficiency was performed in polypropylene
   seedling plug pots containing a mixture of sand and vermiculite with a
   nutrient solution. A total of 74 bacterial strains were obtained from
   isolation of the forage peanut nodules, 40 from Isabela, and 34 from
   Lavras. Partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was obtained for 48
   strains, 30 from Isabela, and 18 from Lavras. The strains isolated from
   nodules of forage peanut in pasture areas of Isabela, were identified in
   the following genera: Bradyrhizobium (21), Rhizobium (5), Burkholderia
   (2), Kocuria (1), and Paenibacillus (1). The strains coming from soils
   of Lavras, were identified in the following genera: Bradyrhizobium (13),
   Rhizobium (2), Burkholderia (1), Mucilaginibacter (1), and Enterobacter
   (1). In the authentication experiment, 17 strains from Isabela, and 13
   strains from Lavras, exhibited nodulation. From these authenticated
   strains, 18 were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing as belonging to the
   Bradyrhizobium genus. Of these strains, 11 from the two areas exhibited
   high symbiotic efficiency in A. pintoi, and their results were better
   than those of the strains currently approved as inoculants for this
   crop. The non-nodulating strains are probably nodule endophytes.
   Sequencing of the gyrB housekeeping gene, performed in 13 strains,
   confirms phylogenetic groups of potential new species among the strains
   isolated from A. pintoi, which include strains able to nodulate this
   species, belonging to a specific phylogenetic group of Bradyrhizobium.
   Sequences of nifH gene of efficient strains belonged to a group
   different from that formed by non-nodulating strains.}},

   Mediterranean geophyte Gagea lacaitae}},
Journal = {{BOTANY LETTERS}},
Abstract = {{Land use changes in the northern Mediterranean basin threaten our
   ability to conserve its habitats and species. Reduced grazing has led to
   local declines in grassland species and colonization by forest species
   leading to conservation actions aimed at restoring open habitats.
   Recently, populations of Gagea lacaitae, a bulbous species typical of
   Mediterranean open xeric grasslands, have been discovered in forest
   clearings, an unexpected habitat for this species. Here, we surveyed 48
   plots to characterize and compare the ecological niche of G. lacaitae
   growing in both open xeric and forest clearing habitats. We recorded
   floristic composition and plant cover and collected soil samples to
   measure water retention capacity, pH, organic matters and conductivity.
   Open xeric grasslands and forest clearings differ in plant cover,
   community composition, and microhabitat structure but not in plant
   diversity, mean soil conditions, or G. lacaitae cover. Key similarities
   in conditions allow this species to persist in woodlands that
   heterogenous enough to include clearings. Such habitats have value for
   conserving this species and should be sustained.}},

Journal = {{ECOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{In regions with a long-standing history of grazing pressure, vegetation

   dynamics. Although this type of trophic interaction has been recognised
   as being important for shaping how vegetation responds to climate,
   better knowledge about how this process occurs on the landscape scale

   To understand the relations among climate, plants and animal population,
   we fitted a Bayesian model to a combination of long-term (1995-2014)
   climate datasets, satellite greenness maps (NASA Landsat NDVI) and
   exotic Barbary sheep census data (breeding success and abundance of
   Ammotragus lervia). We also used the intrinsic mode function and Hilbert
   spectrum transformations to decompose NDVI time series and to evaluate
   their periodic oscillations. We found remarkable dissimilarities as to
   how climate affects the temporal oscillation of vegetation greenness
   between landscapes both with and without ungulates, albeit their
   similarities under environmental conditions. Vegetation responses to
   climate are particularly attenuated in landscapes with ungulates, an
   effect that depends on ungulate population abundance. In a world where
   extreme climate events are becoming frequent and intense, our results
   indicate that ungulates can strongly modulate how grasslands and
   scrublands respond to climate change. Increasing our knowledge as to how
   this type of trophic interaction affects vegetation responses to climate
   variability is of much importance for managing ungulate rewilding
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Food production processes may have both positive and negative
   environmental sustainability impacts. This makes decision-making
   challenging in the transition towards more sustainable food production
   systems. In this paper, a new method for presenting environmental
   impacts in the context of planetary boundaries is demonstrated. This
   will help food and agricultural producers compare the magnitudes of
   various environmental impacts.
   The environmental sustainability impacts of an organic sheep farm in the
   boreal climate zone in Finland are studied herein first using a life
   cycle assessment method. The results are then normalized and presented
   in a planetary boundary framework to ascertain the extent of different
   environmental impacts.
   The results show that in the planetary boundary context, there are
   positive impacts of sheep grazing on biosphere integrity (genetic
   diversity) and biogeochemical flows and negative impacts on climate
   change, land use or freshwater use. Magnitudes of the impacts greatly
   dependent on the assumptions made especially regarding biosphere
   integrity impacts. In the future, it is crucial that decision-making be
   based on the evaluation of various environmental impacts and that the
   focus be more on complex sustainability thinking, rather than on one
   single environmental impact.
   This research demonstrates that results from a life cycle assessment can
   be modified and presented in a planetary boundaries context. A planetary
   boundary framework approach similar to that proposed herein could be
   further used to identify different environmental sustainability
   perspectives and to help one better recognize the multifunctional
   aspects of the ecosystem processes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Ecological interactions between aquatic plants and sediment communities
   can shape the structure and function of natural systems. Currently, we
   do not fully understand how sea- grass habitat degradation impacts the
   biodiversity of belowground sediment communities. Here, we evaluated
   indirect effects of disturbance of seagrass meadows on meiobenthic
   community composition, with a five-month in situ experiment in a
   tropical seagrass meadow. Disturbance was created by reducing light
   availability (two levels of shading), and by mimicking grazing events
   (two levels) to assess impacts on meiobenthic diversity using high-
   throughput sequencing of 18S rRNA amplicons. Both shading and simulated
   grazing had an effect on meiobenthic community structure, mediated by
   seagrass-associated biotic drivers and sediment abiotic variables.
   Additionally, shading substantially altered the trophic structure of the
   nematode community. Our findings show that degradation of seagrass
   meadows can alter benthic community structure in coastal areas with
   potential impacts to ecosystem functions mediated by meiobenthos in
   marine sediments.}},

Title = {{Contrasting impacts of climate change on the vegetation of windy ridges

Journal = {{ALPINE BOTANY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{129}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{95-105}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The impacts of climate change on alpine summit floras have been widely
   investigated. However, only few studies included alpine grasslands and
   generally concluded that snowbeds, with a long snow cover duration and a
   short growing season, and windy ridges, with a short snow cover duration
   and strong winter frosts, are the most sensitive alpine grasslands.
   However, these habitats were mostly investigated in different regions,
   where local factors (e.g. nitrogen deposition, grazing) can co-vary with
   climate changes, potentially obscuring differences between habitats.
   Here, we focused on the Zermatt region (Swiss Alps) to investigate the
   impacts of climate change on snowbeds and windy ridges. Forty-three
   exhaustive historical plant inventories on windy ridges (acidophilic or
   basophilic) and 31 inventories in snowbeds (typical or wet) were
   repeated in quasi-permanent plots after approximately 23 years.
   Historical and recent records were compared with the Simpson index,
   Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, a PCA, ecological indicator values and the
   frequency and cover changes of species. There was a general increase in
   alpha-diversity and a decrease in beta-diversity (homogenisation). Most
   of the new species in the plots were generalists from surrounding
   grasslands. The plant composition tended to be more thermophilous on
   acidophilic windy ridges and in typical snowbeds. The flora of
   acidophilic windy ridges became more similar to that of basophilic windy
   ridges and more eutrophic. We interpreted this as possibly arising from
   fertilisation by the aeolian dust deposition coming from the expanding
   glacial moraine in the valley. In snowbeds, the species indicated
   increasingly drier conditions, especially in wet snowbeds. Warming
   climate induces lower snowfall and earlier snowmelt, leading to a
   shorter snow cover duration. Hence, wet snowbeds are certainly among the
   most threatened plant communities by climate change in the Alps.}},

Title = {{Restoration strategies for grasslands colonized by Asphodel-dominant
   communities}},
Journal = {{GRASSLAND SCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Grassland habitats are particularly threatened in Europe, especially in
   marginal areas where funds and manpower for their conservative
   management are limited. Knowledge of the vegetation dynamics is crucial
   for the timeliness and economy of any conservation actions. However,
   there is a lack of studies on effective and rapid containment of tall
   rhizomatous geophytes, such as asphodel (Asphodelus macrocarpus Parl.
   subsp. macrocarpus), which are particularly active in the earliest
   stages of the natural vegetation succession. We present an
   interdisciplinary study carried out on an abandoned semi-natural
   grassland (European Union habitat code 6210{*}) colonized by Asphodel
   within a Natura 2000 site in the central Apennines (Italy). This
   experimental trial lasted 4 years (2012-2015) and applied three
   different treatments (mowing with removal of cut material, mowing
   without removal of cut material and chopping), compared to the control
   (abandonment). The results highlight that the disturbance produced by
   biomass removal has positive effects on biodiversity. In particular,
   mowing (both with or without removal of cut material) provided better
   results for restoration of the grassland biodiversity, even over the
   short term. Chopping is not a viable alternative to mowing, especially
   because of the risk of eutrophication over time, and the consequent
   settlement and increase in nitrophilous species.}},

Title = {{Soil bacterial biodiversity is driven by long-term pasture management,
   poultry litter, and cattle manure inputs}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Soil microorganisms are important for maintaining soil health,
   decomposing organic matter, and recycling nutrients in pasture systems.
   However, the impact of long-term conservation pasture management on soil
   microbial communities remains unclear. Therefore, soil microbiome
   responses to conservation pasture management is an important component
   of soil health, especially in the largest agricultural land-use in the
   US. The aim of this study was to identify soil microbiome community
   differences following 13-years of pasture management (hayed (no cattle),
   continuously grazed, rotationally grazed with a fenced, un-grazed and
   unfertilized buffer strip, and a control (no poultry litter or cattle
   manure inputs)). Since 2004, all pastures (excluding the control)
   received annual poultry litter at a rate of 5.6 Mg ha(-1). Soil samples
   were collected at a 0-15 cm depth from 2016-017 either pre or post
   poultry litter applications, and bacterial communities were
   characterized using Illumina 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Overall,
   pasture management influenced soil microbial community structure, and
   effects were different by year (P < 0.05). Soils receiving no poultry
   litter or cattle manure had the lowest richness (Chao). Continuously
   grazed systems had greater (P < 0.05) soil community richness, which
   corresponded with greater soil pH and nutrients. Consequently,
   continuously grazed systems may increase soil diversity, owing to
   continuous nutrient-rich manure deposition; however, this management
   strategy may adversely affect aboveground plant communities and water
   quality. These results suggest conservation pasture management (e.g.,
   rotationally grazed systems) may not improve microbial diversity,
   albeit, buffer strips were reduced nutrients and bacterial movement as
   evident by low diversity and fertility in these areas compared to areas
   with manure or poultry litter inputs. Overall, animal inputs (litter or
   manure) increased soil microbiome diversity and may be a mechanism for
   improved soil health.}},

Abstract = {{Invasive plant species have become increasingly problematic in tropical
   and sub-tropical ecosystems, with the potential to decrease native plant
   diversity, increase fire occurrence, and cause ecosystem degradation.
   Numerous factors including disturbance due to fire, grazing, roads,
   human activities, reduction of native diversity, and soil fertility are
   known to influence invasibility of a habitat and/or promote the spread
   of invasive species. We studied invasive species distribution and
   abundance in a 519 km(2) wildlife reserve that has sub-tropical woodland
   and grasslands. We sampled 134 plots of size 30 x 30 m(2) and found that
   Mikania micrantha (a climber) and Chromolaena odorata (a shrub) were the
   most prominent invasive plants. We then tested the influence of eleven
   environmental variables that are either direct measures or proxies of
   resource availability, vegetation density, disturbance, and moisture
   stress. Using these predictors, we performed a decision-tree-based
   regression and prediction to test the influence of these variables on
   invasive species abundance and to generate distribution maps. The model
   had significant predictive power in the case of Mikania (R-2 = 0.469)
   but was poor for Chromolaena (R-2 = 0.056). Annual precipitation, soil
   phosphorus, and vegetation attributes had a significant influence in
   Mikania, and fire frequency had the strongest influence on Chromolaena.
   We could not quantify direct disturbance such as cattle grazing and
   resource extraction, which could add to the predictive power for these
   species. Given that invasive species continue to expand in range and
   abundance, more directed ecological monitoring and analyses are needed
   to manage ecosystems under the threat of invasions.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how disturbances influence interaction networks is a
   central but still poorly explored issue in ecology and management. The
   goal of this study was to test how the structure of plant-pollinator
   networks and the structuring processes are influenced by grazing in a
   subtropical grassland community on the southern hemisphere. Twelve
   sampling plots were allocated in order to cover a grazing gradient
   ranging from overgrazed to ungrazed sites. For each plot, we created a
   quantitative matrix containing all observed pairwise insect-plant
   interactions and described morphology, phenology and abundances of each
   species. We fitted a series of models to test the influence of grazing
   intensity on metrics describing networks structure. We finally used
   probabilistic matrices, maximum likelihood and model selection to
   investigate the processes influencing frequencies of interactions across
   the gradient of disturbance. Grazing intensity influenced connectance,
   specialization and interaction evenness, while the number of species and
   links, nestedness and modularity were less variable. Species abundance
   was the most important determinant of interaction frequencies regardless
   of grazing intensity. In contrast to northern hemisphere pollination
   networks studied so far, these subtropical plant-pollinator networks and
   their structuring processes were remarkably consistent along the grazing
   gradient. We argue that this results from the dominance of generalist
   Asteraceae species, which are selectively avoided by cattle and play a
   core role in attracting a wide range of pollinators and thereby
   structuring plant-pollinator interactions, providing therefore
   stability.}},

Title = {{Suppresive plants as weed management tool: Managing Parthenium
   hysterophorus under simulated grazing in Australian grasslands}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},

Volume = {{247}},

Abstract = {{Parthenium hysterophorus L. is among one of the most problematic
   invasive grassland weeds in Australia, and in many other countries
   around the world. It can reduce pasture and livestock production,
   natural community biodiversity, and negatively affect human and animal
   health. Sowing of selected suppressive pasture plants in parthenium weed
   infested grasslands has shown potential to improve efficacy of
   management. However, such species need to be tested for their ability to
   suppress weed growth under grazing conditions. The parthenium weed
   suppressive and fodder production capacity of six selected pasture
   species {[}purple pigeon grass (Setaria incrassata), buffel grass
   (Cenchrus ciliaris), butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea), Kangaroo grass
   (Themeda triandra), bull Mitchell grass (Astrebla squarrosa) and Indian
   bluegrass (Bothriochloa pertusa)] was tested under no (0\%), low (25\%),
   moderate (50\%) and heavy (75\%) simulated grazing pressures in a
   grassland area of south-central Queensland, Australia. Purple pigeon
   grass, buffel grass and butterfly pea legume suppressed the growth of
   parthenium weed by > 50\% under low and moderate simulated grazing
   pressures, as well as generating moderate to high amounts of fodder
   biomass (up to 5.07 t ha(-1) per year). Native species, Kangaroo grass
   and bull Mitchell grass both suppressed the parthenium weed's growth by
   > 50\% under low simulated grazing pressure, however, they generated low
   to moderate amounts of biomass, 1.83 t ha(-1) and 2.7 t ha(-1) per year,
   respectively. The sowing of selected suppressive pasture species in
   parthenium weed infested grasslands with low-to-moderate grazing
   pressure, assuming this corresponds closely with the simulated
   treatment, would provide an additional tool to the best practice weed
   management strategy as well as sustaining fodder production.}},

Abstract = {{Wetlands are being increasingly affected by anthropogenic activities
   worldwide. The Lower Delta of the Parana River, one of the most
   important wetlands in Argentina, has been profoundly altered because
   most of the natural environments were drained or diked to make them
   suitable for different agricultural activities. As a result, the
   landscape is characterized by a mosaic of Salicaceae afforestations of
   different ages interspersed with patches of secondary forests and
   grazing grasslands. The high susceptibility of Carabidae and Aphodiidae
   to natural and human-induced disturbances and management practices is
   reflected by changes in their spatiotemporal distribution. We performed
   a 1-year study to analyze and compare beetle's communities inhabiting
   different habitat types in this modified wetland landscape. A total of
   58 beetle species were recorded, of which 48 were carabids and 10
   aphodids. Although species richness and diversity were higher in
   productive habitats (afforestations and grasslands) than in secondary
   forests, hydrophilic species were only found in the latter. Community
   parameters varied seasonally. Our results indicate a close relationship
   between wetland beetle communities and vegetation cover in each habitat
   type. Human activity increases heterogeneity across this landscape,
   which favors the colonization of new species but causes the loss or
   displacement of autochthonous species. The secondary forests could serve
   as alternative habitats for beetles typical of humid environments. We
   propose the maintenance of the current heterogeneous mosaic to favor the
   diversity of ground beetles and the implementation of changes in water
   management for the benefit of hydrophilic beetle species.}},

Abstract = {{Forests can be modified by fine-scale disturbances such as those
   prompted by cattle grazing, but their impacts on biodiversity are far
   from being understood. Here, we investigate the response of
   insectivorous bats to cattle-driven forest disturbances, using a
   savanna-like Mediterranean agroforestry system, the Portuguese montado,
   as study system. In doing so, we compared bat ensemble composition and
   activity levels of bats across sites that differed in how frequently
   they were used by free-ranging cattle. Specifically, we selected sites
   regularly used by cattle (central places) and sites seldom used (grazing
   sites). We found strong between-site differences in both bat species
   composition and activity levels, with lower diversity and activity in
   central places compared to grazing sites. These response patterns,
   corresponded to marked between-site differences in tree cover, seemingly
   driven by cattle use given the lower levels of tree regeneration and
   vegetation productivity in central places compared to grazing sites. Our
   work therefore demonstrates that it is not only severe forest loss and
   fragmentation that has an impact on insectivorous bats, but also when
   these processes operate at fine spatial scales. We thus suggest that
   fine-scale forest disturbances, particularly those driven by recurrent
   cattle use, cannot be neglected in the conservation management of
   agroforestry systems. In this context, we propose some management
   strategies aimed at counteracting the impact of cattle-driven
   disturbances on biodiversity in general, and on insectivorous bats in
   particular.}},

Title = {{Factors explaining the diversity of land cover in abandoned fields in a
   Mediterranean mountain area}},
Journal = {{CATENA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{181}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Abandoned fields form an integral part of the landscape of Mediterranean
   mountains. For centuries, very steep slopes with poor soils were
   cultivated to feed the local population. From the mid-20th century,
   agriculture on many slopes has been abandoned and secondary succession
   is taking place with environmental, socio-economic and landscape
   implications. This paper investigates the role of physical (climate
   variability and topography) and human (age of abandonment and field type
   - flat, sloping, terraced) factors in the process of secondary
   succession in abandoned fields in a representative Mediterranean
   mountain area. Aerial photographs from 1956 and 1978 were used to map
   the space-time process of land abandonment, and field types. Data on
   vegetation cover in abandoned fields was obtained in the SIOSE, the
   information system on land use in Spain (2006). The map was incorporated
   into a GIS and statistical analysis was done with R software (R, version
   3.2.3).
   The results show that altitude and climate variability are the principal
   factors explaining the distribution of areas of forest and shrub. The
   slope and solar radiation are less important. Human management, although
   apparently a lesser determinant, has a strong influence. Management
   before abandonment conditions the spatial distribution of the seed bank
   and the extent of soil degradation. Management following abandonment
   (afforestation of conifers, shrub clearings and livestock grazing)
   decides where pine forest and pastures are located. The results of our
   case study suggest, that unlike most of cases in the literature, the age
   of abandonment is not the main factor explaining the natural succession
   processes. The knowledge about how natural and anthropogenic factors
   affect secondary succession should be considered a tool for land
   management in mountain areas.}},

Abstract = {{Burrowing mammals through their digging activities are important
   ecosystem engineers and bioturbators in grassland ecosystems. Through
   habitat formation, they can have significant effects on other species in
   an ecosystem, structuring their abundance and diversity. We analysed the
   effect of the European ground squirrel (Spermophilus citellus) on spider
   (Araneae) and harvestman (Opiliones) communities, because these
   arachnids are the most abundant and dominant predators with a great
   variety of foraging strategies, and their community composition is
   strongly influenced by the physical structure of the environment. We
   established replicate mound plots positioned directly in the centre of
   ground squirrel mounds with paired off-mound control plots undisturbed
   by ground squirrels. We sampled spiders and harvestmen using pitfall
   traps on 30 ground squirrel mounds and 30 paired off-mound control plots
   at two study sites differing in grazing intensity and plant species
   richness. We found that the response of spiders was site-specific, while
   harvestmen responded consistently to disturbances by burrowing mammals.
   Mounds exhibited increased abundance and species richness of harvestmen
   at both study sites, while species richness of spiders was increased
   only in intensively managed grassland. We also detected compositional
   changes of the arachnid community on the mounds in comparison to the
   grassland matrix. Our findings indicate that burrowing mammals through
   physical state changes in abiotic and biotic material modulate the
   resources for other species and maintain a high diversity of biotic
   communities in intensively grazed grasslands.}},

Journal = {{BIODIVERSITY DATA JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{SEP 27}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The 150 grassland plots were located in three study regions in Germany,
   50 in each region. The dataset describes the yearly grassland management
   for each grassland plot using 116 variables.
   General information includes plot identifier, study region and survey
   year. Additionally, grassland plot characteristics describe the presence
   and starting year of drainage and whether arable farming had taken place
   25 years before our assessment, i.e. between 1981 and 2006. In each
   year, the size of the management unit is given which, in some cases,
   changed slightly across years.
   Mowing, grazing and fertilisation were systematically surveyed:
   Mowing is characterised by mowing frequency (i.e. number of cuts per
   year), dates of cutting and different technical variables, such as type
   of machine used or usage of conditioner.
   For grazing, the livestock species and age (e.g. cattle, horse, sheep),
   the number of animals, stocking density per hectare and total duration
   of grazing were recorded. As a derived variable, the mean grazing
   intensity was then calculated by multiplying the livestock units with
   the duration of grazing per hectare {[}LSU days/ha]. Different grazing
   periods during a year, partly involving different herds, were summed up
   to an annual grazing intensity for each grassland.
   For fertilisation, information on the type and amount of different types
   of fertilisers was recorded separately for mineral and organic
   fertilisers, such as solid farmland manure, slurry and mash from a
   bioethanol factory. Our fertilisation measures neglect dung dropped by
   livestock during grazing. For each type of fertiliser, we calculated its
   total nitrogen content, derived from chemical analyses by the producer
   or agricultural guidelines (Table 3).
   All three management types, mowing, fertilisation and grazing, were used
   to calculate a combined land use intensity index (LUI) which is
   frequently used to define a measure for the land use intensity. Here,
   fertilisation is expressed as total nitrogen per hectare {[}kg N/ha],
   but does not consider potassium and phosphorus.
   Information on additional management practices in grasslands was also
   recorded including levelling, to tear-up matted grass covers, rolling,
   to remove surface irregularities, seed addition, to close gaps in the
   sward.
   New information
   Investigating the relationship between human land use and biodiversity
   is important to understand if and how humans affect it through the way
   they manage the land and to develop sustainable land use strategies.
   Quantifying land use (the `X' in such graphs) can be difficult as humans
   manage land using a multitude of actions, all of which may affect
   biodiversity, yet most studies use rather simple measures of land use,
   for example, by creating land use categories such as conventional vs.
   organic agriculture. Here, we provide detailed data on grassland
   management to allow for detailed analyses and the development of land
   use theory. The raw data have already been used for > 100 papers on the
   effect of management on biodiversity (e.g. Manning et al. 2015).}},

Abstract = {{Forestry intensification in Central European lowland forests leads to a
   substantial increase in canopy closure, which causes biodiversity
   decline and functional homogenization across multiple trophic levels.
   Small-scale canopy interventions such as local clearings with few
   left-over adult trees are proposed to halt such a decline but the
   outcomes can be highly scale- and site-dependent. Here two types of
   experimental clearings were applied - clearings connected to alluvial
   meadows distributed along migration river corridors versus clearings
   inside the forest - in an attempt to restore thermophilous oak forest
   diversity at six woodland sites in Central Europe. Within each clearing,
   we studied vegetation changes at two spatial scales (1600 m(2) and 4
   m(2)) for six years in relation to composition of surrounding habitats
   (closed forests, relict open forests, meadows, forest edges), soil seed
   bank and plant functional traits in order to assess the relative role of
   species pool, dispersal limitation and niche-based competition processes
   for forest diversity restoration. In both types of forest clearings,
   plant species diversity substantially increased, peaking in the second
   and third years after cutting the trees when the vegetation was still
   sparse. Afterwards, when the vegetation was becoming dense and plant
   competition increased, the species richness in clearings decreased but
   was still higher compared to other forest habitats. Species composition
   changed from thin-leafed, wind dispersible early colonizers represented
   by light-demanding shortlived species towards shade-tolerant perennial
   species. Connected clearings were more species-rich than isolated
   clearings at the larger scale, but less diverse at the fine scale,
   indicating larger within-site heterogeneity caused by lower dispersal
   limitation but stronger competition compared to isolated clearings.
   Light and nutrient-demanding plants were more diverse and abundant in
   connected than isolated clearings while threatened species of relict
   open forests tended to establish more in isolated clearings. Our results
   show the important role of clearing location within the landscape
   context for restoring plant biodiversity of lowland forests.}},

Title = {{Ecological, biophysical and production effects of incorporating rest
   into grazing regimes: A global meta-analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Grazing can have considerable ecological impacts when managed
   inappropriately, however livestock production is a significant
   contributor to global food security and the removal of land from
   production is not always a viable option. Grazing management practices
   that incorporate periods of planned rest (i.e. strategic-rest grazing)
   may be an alternative to grazing exclusion or continuous grazing that
   could achieve ecological and animal production outcomes simultaneously.
   We conducted a meta-analysis of global literature to investigate how
   strategic-rest grazing mediates ecological (i.e., plant richness and
   diversity), biophysical (plant biomass and ground cover) and production
   response variables (animal weight gain and animal production per
   hectare) compared to continuously grazed or ungrazed areas. Overall,
   total ground cover and animal production per hectare were significantly
   greater under strategic-rest grazing than continuous grazing management,
   but biomass, plant richness, plant diversity and animal weight gain did
   not differ between grazing treatments. Increasing the length of rest
   relative to graze time under strategic-rest grazing was associated with
   an increase in plant biomass, ground cover, animal weight gain and
   animal production per hectare when compared to continuous grazing.
   Synthesis and applications. Understanding both the ecological and animal
   production trade-offs associated with different grazing management
   strategies is essential to make informed decisions about best-management
   practices for the world's grazing lands. We show that incorporating
   periods of rest into grazing regimes improves ground cover and animal
   production per hectare and that these benefits are more pronounced with
   increases in the length of time land is rested for. This extended rest
   also improves biomass production and weight gain compared to continuous
   grazing systems. Based on these meta-analyses, we recommend that future
   research considers the duration of rest compared to graze time in
   comparisons of grazing systems.}},

Abstract = {{To compensate for an airport expansion, including construction on
   valuable wet meadows of a Natura 2000 system, 1.3 ha of turf, cut into
   blocks, were transferred to artificial basins in a habitat garden. To
   evaluate the impact of translocation on this ecosystem, and thus the
   success of its preservation, we monitored fungal root colonisation of
   Molinia caerulea, the diagnostic plant species for wet meadows, along
   with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) species richness and composition
   in soils and soil microbial processes for three seasons: prior to the
   transfer (2013) and the two following years (2014-15). We observed few
   changes in the fungal colonisation of M. caerulea, suggesting that the
   fungal associations of this species were unaffected. The number of AMF
   species declined directly after the translocation; however, in 2015, an
   increased number of species was recorded. There were no differences in
   AMF species composition, nor did soil basal respiration rate,
   substrate-induced respiration (SIR), or substrate-active biomass (C-mic)
   change over the years. Only metabolic coefficient (qCO(2)) decreased
   after the transfer. The small number of effects in fungal root
   colonisation, AMF diversity, and microbial processes following the
   translocation of the ecosystem prove its success. This can be attributed
   to the deep turf translocation that kept the relevant microbial
   communities almost unaffected.}},

   a randomized block design (by topographic position) with repeated
   measures over time, using livestock exclusion as treatment. Results
   After 16 months, livestock exclusion affected vegetation species
   richness, but did not have a significant effect on diversity due to a
   slightly compensatory effect of evenness. Species composition differed
   markedly among treatments over time. There was an increase in dry and
   green vegetative biomass and litter content after eight months of
   exclusion, while changes in reproductive biomass occurred later. The
   increase in these variables was closely related to changes in biomass of
   species with erect habit and good forage quality. Conclusions Livestock
   exclusion increased the forage value for the studied wetland by the
   development of natural palatable species typical of these environments.
   This shift in species composition promoted a higher production in
   biomass in the ungrazed areas. This suggests a remarkable recovery of
   the structural and functional parameters of the vegetation communities
   in the short term (two years).}},

Title = {{Species and functional differences between subalpine grasslands with and
   without dwarf shrub encroachment}},
Journal = {{PLANT BIOSYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Diversity of subalpine semi-natural grasslands is threatened by both
   overgrazing and abandonment, resulting in degradation and woody plants
   encroachment, respectively. The effects of overgrazing, followed by a
   sharp decline of grazing are rarely assessed in uncontrolled conditions.
   We aimed at assessing plant species and functional diversity within the
   grass-dwarf shrub mosaic. Species abundance and selected plant
   functional traits (leaf, height, seed) were assessed within 16 m(2)
   plots in adjacent grass-dominated and low-cover dwarf shrub vegetation
   patches. Species-based and functional patterns were quantified by
   Simpson's diversity, Rao's quadratic entropy, the plot weighted mean of
   plant traits and analysed with nonmetric multidimensional scaling
   ordination and linear mixed-effect models. Despite the appearance of
   dwarf shrub canopy effect and light competition, higher species-based
   and functional diversity were found in the dwarf shrub patch. Our
   results point to the strong legacy of past overgrazing and the related
   filtering effects on the trait complex of assembling species, especially
   in the grass-dominated patches. We conclude that pastures incorporating
   dwarf shrubs at low cover are favourable in terms of species and
   functional diversity and recommend the maintaining of intermediate
   grazing intensity to support mosaic vegetation structures that are
   beneficial for biodiversity conservation in the study area.}},

Title = {{Structure and vulnerability of the multi-interaction network in
   macrophyte-dominated lakes}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Abstract = {{The network approach is crucial to understand how ecosystems are
   structured and how they will respond to the disturbances (e.g. the
   current global change). We have recreated the multi-interaction network
   of a shallow freshwater lake dominated by submerged macrophytes
   (Charophytes), a known system very vulnerable to environmental changes,
   considering both trophic and non-trophic relationships among its
   elements. To minimize the environmental variability, we established it
   in an experimental mesocosm, including three habitats: the pelagic, the
   habitat around the meadow and the periphytic community living on
   macrophytes. We aimed to study the structure of this network and the
   roles of its elements, as well as the response of this system to a
   foreseeable decrease in charophytes due to the global change. Thus, we
   tested whether there are species in the system that, due to the
   connections they establish, have central or connecting roles and if the
   reduction of charophytes affects more the elements that live intimately
   associated with them. Our results confirm that charophytes are the most
   central node in the network and that the high-mobility large planktonic
   herbivores living within the meadow are acting as bridges between the
   conformant compartments. This suggests a structurally crucial tandem
   macrophytes-herbivores with the former playing a foundation role (i.e.
   basal and abundant species centralizing non-trophic interactions) and
   the latter being connectors in this network. Interestingly, we found
   that the periphytic elements where those with the highest capacity to
   affect the other elements of the network when being disturbed.
   Furthermore, an eventual decrease in the abundance of charophytes will
   cause a major direct damage to the meadow and periphyton, compartments
   to which they provide refuge and life support, respectively. Our study
   highlights the need of approaches encompassing the complex structure of
   the ecological networks to identify crucial species (such as foundation
   or connecting species) for their topology and vulnerability geared
   towards conservation biology.}},

   conservation}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{237}},
Pages = {{493-503}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Modem production forests in Europe have closed canopies. As a
   consequence, the biodiversity associated with open woodland is
   declining. Forest grazing that created open conditions was once
   widespread. It was largely abandoned during the 20th century but is
   currently receiving increasing attention as a tool in nature
   conservation. In order to elucidate the value of newly created wood
   pastures for the conservation of birds and grasshoppers we selected nine
   wood pastures (WP) in southern Rhineland-Palatinate (Germany). In most
   of them part of the trees had been removed to create more open
   conditions. We selected adjacent ungrazed forests (F) and open pastures
   (OP) for comparison. Birds were recorded via territory mapping,
   grasshoppers via standardised transect surveys. We found higher bird
   species richness in WP compared to F and OP and more breeding pairs per
   area compared to open pastures. Target species for conservation like
   European nightjar (Caprimuigus europaeus) were only recorded in WP.
   Grasshopper species richness in WP and OP was similar but low in F.
   Species with conservation relevance only occurred in WP and OP.
   Community composition of both taxa differed between habitat types and
   beta-diversity of birds was significantly higher among WP than among F
   and OP. We conclude that even in recently established sites, canopy
   opening in connection with grazing is a very effective tool in nature
   conservation, especially in order to promote species that favour open,
   structurally diverse forest habitats.}},

Title = {{Harvest Time Determines Quality and Usability of Biomass from Lowland
   Hay Meadows}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE-BASEL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Species-rich hay meadows are usually managed extensively to maintain
   their biodiversity, with the harvested biomass traditionally being fed
   to ruminants for milk or meat production. The quality of the biomass is,
   however, variable, difficult to predict and often does not fulfil
   today's requirements. This study established a field trial at two
   species-rich hay meadows to investigate the combined effect of
   fertilisation (none, phosphorus and potassium (PK), nitrogen, phosphorus
   and potassium (NPK)) and date of first cut (at different phenological
   stages) on biomass quality and quantity. In addition, the most suitable
   uses of the biomass were explored, including the alternatives biogas and
   combustion. After four years of the field trial, the stage of maturity
   at the time of first cut had a greater influence than extensive
   fertilisation on biomass quality. Dry matter yield (DMY) of the first
   cut was about 40\%-60\% of annual DMY (53.99 +/- 12.51 dt ha(-1) a(-1))
   depending on site, fertilisation and harvest time. Fertilisation had a
   stronger effect than harvest time on DMY and annual methane yield. In
   most cases, there was no significant difference in chemical composition
   between biomass harvested at the end of the grass-flowering stage and at
   the seed-ripening stage. Thus, a late cut for hay proved to be the most
   flexible option.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Biogas production is a key renewable energy pathway for a more
   sustainable future bioeconomy. However, there is a crucial trade-off
   between biomass productivity and social-ecological sustainability of
   available biogas cropping systems. Permanent grassland has been
   frequently promoted as a promising perennial cropping system for biomass
   production. Three- and four-cut regimes are usually the highest-yielding
   and thus preferable for biogas production. A three-year field trial in
   southwest Germany investigated biomass yield and biochemical composition
   of mesotrophic Arrhenatheretum grassland under three cutting regimes
   (two-, three- and four-cut). For the three-cut regime, a preliminary
   biogas batch test was conducted. The three-cut regime had the highest
   annual accumulated dry matter yield (11.8-14.8 Mg ha(-1)), an average
   specific methane yield of 0.289 m(N)(3) kg(-1) volatile solids(-1) and
   an accumulated annual methane yield of 3167-3893 m(N)(3) ha(-1). The
   four-cut regime performed least favorably due to a lower dry matter
   yield than the three-cut regime, the highest ash content and the highest
   nitrogen content. Thus, the three-cut regime promises the best yield
   performance, whereas the two-cut regime can potentially provide more
   ecosystem services such as biodiversity conservation and wild-game
   protection. Consequently, the two-cut regime could help improve the
   social-ecological sustainability of biogas crop cultivation.}},

Abstract = {{Soil seed bank is a reservoir for passive restoration of rangelands
   following bush clearance. This study was conducted to assess the effects
   of bush clearance on the seed bank size, composition, diversity and
   relationship between soil seed bank (SSB) and above ground vegetation
   (AGV) in Springbokvlakte thornveld. The study was conducted at Radi
   communal rangeland, Makapanstad in North-West Province, South Africa
   with an average rainfall of 459 mm annum(-1). The rangeland was
   encroached at an average density of 6908 woody plants ha(-1) by
   Vachellia tenuispina, Vachellia tortilis, Ziziphus mucronata and
   Asparagus laricinus, with V. tenuispina accounting for 92\% of the woody
   cover. All woody plants within 50 x 25 m plots were mechanically cut
   using manual saws and loppers followed by chemical stump treatment using
   picloram. The cleared and their adjacent uncleared microsites were
   marked in the middle of a large shrubland and were protected from
   grazing. Soil samples were collected at three depths (0-10, > 10-20 and
   > 20-30 cm) in April (pre-treatment), August, October, December 2016
   and, April and August 2017 in bush cleared and uncleared microsites. SSB
   was determined using the seedling emergence method. Vegetation surveys
   were conducted in February 2016 (pre-treatment) and 2017
   (post-treatment). Thirty-seven species from 16 families emerged from the
   SSB. Perennial species were the most abundant life-form until December
   2016, after which annuals increased to 70 and 71\% in April and August
   2017, respectively in cleared microsites. Eragrostis lehmanniana,
   Jamesbrittenia aurantiaca and Aristida bipartita were the most abundant
   species until December 2016, thereafter; Brachiaria eruciformis
   dominated by 55-61\% from April to August 2017 in cleared microsites.
   Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that most seed bank species
   correlated strongly with total soil nitrogen, C:N ratio and nitrates.
   Total seed densities remained similar from August to December 2016,
   thereafter; they were 2- to 3-fold higher in cleared compared to
   uncleared microsites. Seed densities declined significantly (p < .05)
   with burial depth in April and August 2017 in cleared microsites.
   Species diversity declined with time in cleared relative to uncleared
   microsites, mainly due to B. eruciformis homogenising the SSB in April
   and August 2017, respectively. In contrast, S(sic)rensen's similarity
   between SSB and AGV increased with time, being highest in cleared than
   uncleared microsites from December 2016 to August 2017. Large seed bank
   densities in cleared microsites indicated high potential for vegetation
   recovery following bush clearance. However, follow-up management to
   drive vegetation changes to perennial species dominated state is
   necessary. (C) 2019 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Free living nematodes are the most abundant and diverse metazoans in
   aquatic sediments. We used a framework of habitat types to reveal
   quantitative patterns in species richness (SR), beta-diversity, and
   biological traits (BT). Meiofauna was quantitatively collected from 60
   sites within nine habitat types and 24,736 nematodes were identified to
   species level. We reported a regional richness of 410 +/- 12 species for
   the Cuban archipelago; however, caves and deep waters need to be sampled
   more intensively. Relationships between SR and abundance supported the
   dynamic equilibrium model with habitats ordered across gradients of
   resource availability and physical disturbance. Seagrass meadows were
   the most specious and freshwater/anchihaline caves the least diverse
   habitats. Differences in beta-diversity likely were due to habitat
   heterogeneity and limitations for dispersal. The assemblage composition
   was unique in some habitats likely reflecting the effects of habitat
   filtering. However, coastal habitats shared many species reflecting high
   connectivity and dispersal capability of nematodes due to hydrodynamics.
   The BTs ``life strategy{''}, ``trophic group{''}, and ``tail shape{''}
   reflected ecological adaptations; but ``amphidial fovea{''} and
   ``cuticle{''}, likely reflected phylogenetic signatures from
   families/genera living in different habitats. Habitat type played an
   influential role in the diversity patterns of aquatic nematodes from
   taxonomic and functional points of view.}},

Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Most high value grasslands of south-eastern Australia are restricted to
   small fragmented areas of public land. However, a significant proportion
   of native grassland is privately owned, managed with grazing rather than
   fire and is rarely monitored. Hence, a better understanding of grassland
   management and conservation on the private estate is required.
   Eco-markets are policy instruments that incentivise private landholders
   to effectively manage and conserve native vegetation. However, short
   funding cycles restrict the capacity of monitoring programs to assess
   long-term vegetation changes. In this study, 17 native grassland
   remnants on private land managed with livestock grazing were monitored
   before and during a 4-year eco-market and 6 years after it ended to
   determine how composition had changed over 10 years of monitoring.
   Numerous grassland attributes were either maintained or improved over
   the 10-year period, which coincided with one of the most severe and
   long-lasting droughts in recent history (i.e. the Millennium drought).
   In addition, several threatened species were identified as part of the
   program. A decline in exotic forb richness, native grass cover and
   native forb richness suggests there is also some impact of the
   Millennium drought on plant mortality as evidenced by altered litter
   dynamics. Inherent variability year-to-year for most measures of
   grassland attributes over the monitoring period indicates that climatic
   conditions have a strong influence on grassland dynamics. Our ability to
   determine the driver(s) of grassland composition was limited by
   monitoring program design. Future eco-market monitoring programs should
   have adequate resources allocated to enable effective monitoring
   designs, that incorporate reference information and control sites, and
   should aim to be long-term (i.e. >10 years). This will provide clearer
   insights into the drivers of grassland dynamics and allow for refinement
   of management options for conservation of this threatened community.}},

Abstract = {{Animals are central to numerous ecological processes that shape the
   structure and function of ecosystems. It follows that species that are
   strongly linked to specific functions can represent these functions
   spatially and hence be useful in conservation planning. Here we test
   this notion of `functional species surrogacy' for the conservation of
   seagrass meadows that have been impacted by stressors. We measured algal
   herbivory and herbivorous fish assemblages across a range of seagrass
   meadows in the Moreton Bay Marine Park, Queensland, Australia. We
   determined the suitability of herbivorous fish to act as a surrogate for
   the function of algal herbivory and modelled the abundance of this
   surrogate, and thus herbivory, in seagrass meadows to compare the
   spatial distribution of this function within existing reserves. We used
   underwater video systems to determine the abundance of all herbivorous
   fish species in seagrass meadows. The abundance of the dusky rabbitfish
   (Siganus fuscescens) was the best predictor of algal herbivory in
   seagrass meadows, supporting the suitability of this species as a
   functional surrogate. The distribution of dusky rabbitfish, and
   therefore the ecological function of herbivory, was not well represented
   in the Moreton Bay Marine Park protected areas. Only 7\% of the
   equivalent area of seagrass meadows protected in marine reserves were
   found to have high abundances of dusky rabbitfish. We demonstrate that
   the abundance of functionally important herbivores can be suitable as a
   surrogate for herbivory in seagrass conservation. Our findings show that
   data on the spatial distribution of ecological functions can alter
   priorities for reserve design, and we suggest that our functional
   approach to species surrogacy is likely to improve conservation
   performance in seagrass ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Leucaena leucocephala has played a key role in the development of
   sustainable cattle ranching in Latin America. This species is the
   backbone of the so-called Intensive Silvopastoral Systems (ISPS) that
   combine high-density cultivation of leucaena as fodder shrubs
   (4,000-40,000 plants/ha) with grasses and trees. The layers of
   vegetation added by shrubs and trees increase the system's capacity for
   transforming solar energy into biomass and enhance habitat complexity.
   Although part of the biomass is transformed into livestock products, a
   significant amount is deposited as litter on the soil and, along with
   the nitrogen fixed by leucaena and other trees, has positive effects on
   soil properties and grass production. The increased complexity of the
   system has measurable effects on biodiversity. ISPS with leucaena
   support more species of birds, ants, dung beetles and woody plants than
   conventional pasture monocultures, contribute to landscape-scale
   connectivity and provide environmental services. They also enhance
   animal welfare through reduced heat stress and improved availability and
   quality of fodder resources. ISPS contribute to climate change
   mitigation by improving above- and below-ground carbon sequestration and
   by cutting down greenhouse gas emissions per units of dry matter
   consumed and cattle product. Although these systems have been
   successfully implemented in Colombia, Mexico and other countries, their
   adoption is still limited in relation to the area suitable for their
   introduction.}},

Abstract = {{1. Predicting changes in plant diversity in response to human activities
   represents one of the major challenges facing ecologists and land
   managers striving for sustainable ecosystem management. Classical field
   studies have emphasized the importance of community primary productivity
   in regulating changes in plant species richness. However, experimental
   studies have yielded inconsistent empirical evidence, suggesting that
   primary productivity is not the sole determinant of plant diversity.
   Recent work has shown that more accurate predictions of changes in
   species diversity can be achieved by combining measures of species'
   cover and height into an index of space resource utilization (SRU).
   While the SRU approach provides reliable predictions, it is
   time-consuming and requires extensive taxonomic expertise. Ecosystem
   processes and plant community structure are likely driven primarily by
   dominant species (mass ratio effect). Within communities, it is likely
   that dominant and rare species have opposite contributions to overall
   biodiversity trends. We, therefore, suggest that better species richness
   predictions can be achieved by utilizing SRU assessments of only the
   dominant species (SRUD), as compared to SRU or biomass of the entire
   community.
   2. Here, we assess the ability of these measures to predict changes in
   plant diversity as driven by nutrient addition and herbivore exclusion.
   First, we tested our hypotheses by carrying out a detailed analysis in
   an alpine grassland that measured all species within the community.
   Next, we assessed the broader applicability of our approach by measuring
   the first three dominant species for five additional experimental
   grassland sites across a wide geographic and habitat range.
   3. We show that SRUD outperforms community biomass, as well as community
   SRU, in predicting biodiversity dynamics in response to nutrients and
   herbivores in an alpine grassland. Across our additional sites, SRUD
   yielded far better predictions of changes in species richness than
   community biomass, demonstrating the robustness and generalizable nature
   of this approach.
   4. Synthesis. The SRUD approach provides a simple, non-destructive and
   more accurate means to monitor and predict the impact of global change
   drivers and management interventions on plant communities, thereby
   facilitating efforts to maintain and recover plant diversity.}},

Title = {{Plant species richness elicits changes in the metabolome of grassland

Abstract = {{1. Species-rich plant communities can induce unique soil biotic legacy
   effects through changing the abundance and composition of soil biota.
   These soil legacy effects can cause feedbacks to influence plant
   performance. In addition, soil biota can induce (defensive) secondary
   metabolites in shoots and roots and thus affect plant-herbivore
   interactions. We hypothesize that plant diversity-driven soil biotic
   legacy effects elicit changes in the shoot and root metabolome.
   2. We tested this hypothesis by establishing an experiment with four
   plant species. We grew plants in a sterile substrate inoculated with
   soil conditioned by different plant species communities: (a)
   monocultures of either of the four species, (b) the four species in a
   mixture, (c) an eight species mixture including all four species or (d)
   a sterile inoculum. After at least 8 weeks in the field, we estimated
   shoot herbivory. At the same time, we took root and shoot samples for
   metabolomics analyses by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight
   mass spectrometry.
   3. We found that shoot and root metabolomes of all plants grown in
   sterile soil differed significantly from those grown in living soil. The
   plant metabolomes in living soils differed by species and tissue. Across
   all species, shoots displayed a greater richness of secondary
   metabolites than roots. The richness of secondary metabolites differed
   by species and among living soils. The conditioning species richness
   significantly affected the Shannon diversity of secondary metabolites in
   Centaurea jacea. Shoot herbivory positively correlated with the richness
   and Shannon diversity of secondary metabolites in Leucanthemum vulgare.
   We detected multiple metabolites that together explained up to 88\% of
   the variation in herbivory in the shoots of C. jacea and Plantago
   lanceolata.
   4. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that plant diversity-driven shifts in
   soil biota elicit changes in the composition and diversity of shoot and
   root secondary metabolites. However, these plant responses and their
   effect on shoot herbivores are species-specific. Tracking changes in
   plant secondary chemistry in response to soil biotic legacy effects will
   help to understand the mechanisms that govern species-specific
   plant-plant and plant-herbivore interactions.}},

Title = {{Threatened and specialist species suffer from increased wood cover and
   productivity in Swiss steppes}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{258}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In Switzerland, steppe vegetation is restricted to inner alpine dry
   valleys in the West (Valais) and the East (Grisons). They harbour many
   specialist and threatened species. In 2011, a long-term program was
   established to monitor changes in Swiss habitats of national importance.
   Here, we studied patterns of vascular plant diversity in a subset of 148
   steppe plots of 10 m(2) from this program. Plots were either grazed or
   abandoned. On average, we found 23.3 species per plot. The proportion of
   steppe specialists and of threatened species out of the total species
   richness was 29.3\% and 12.2\%, respectively. The total number of
   species increased with elevation and peaked at intermediate productivity
   levels. In contrast, the proportion of threatened and steppe specialist
   species was generally negatively related to higher productivity and wood
   cover - two factors considered as indicators of habitat degradation.
   Abandonment vs. pasture had no effects on total species richness.
   Productivity was positively related to ecological indicator values for
   moisture, competition and ruderality, as well as the community mean
   traits of plant height and specific leaf area, but negatively with the
   indicator value for light. Similarly, wood cover was positively
   associated with higher ecological indicator values for productivity,
   moisture and competition, as well as the community mean trait of plant
   height, but negatively with the indicator value for light and
   ruderality. The negative response of threatened and steppe specialist
   vascular plant species to habitat degrading factors suggests their
   proportional richness to be a better indicator of habitat quality than
   the total species richness. We conclude that management regimes which
   guarantee low productivity and low wood cover and avoid intensification
   by fertilization and irrigation are essential for the conservation of
   steppe habitats. Beside periodic clearing of woody species,
   low-intensity grazing might prevent shrub encroachment.}},

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{A shortage of available livestock for utilizing grassland biomass in
   Central Europe is challenging for the management of both semi-natural
   grasslands and previously intensified (limed, fertilized and reseeded)
   upland grasslands. An alternative method of grassland management is
   mulching, in which aboveground biomass is cut, crushed and subsequently
   spread on the surface. This paper reports on an experiment to compare
   three different mulching frequencies (one, two and three times per year)
   with an unmanaged treatment and traditional management of two cuts per
   year (control) on a previously improved upland meadow. Plant species
   composition was monitored over 13 years. Traditional management of two
   cuts with biomass removal was the most suitable method for maintaining
   plant species richness and diversity, and both were reduced
   significantly in the once-mulched and especially in the unmanaged
   treatment. Tall dicotyledonous weeds such as Urtica dioica, Cirsium
   arvense and Aegopodium podagraria were promoted by the unmanaged
   treatment and by mulching once a year. Higher frequency of defoliation
   had positive effects on the spread of short forbs such as Taraxacum
   spp., Plantago lanceolata and Trifolium repens. After eight years, there
   were changes in sward structure in the unmanaged and mulched-once-a-year
   treatments, with increase in the tall/short species ratio. In
   conclusion, repeated mulching cannot substitute fully for traditional
   two-cut management in improved upland meadows without decreasing plant
   species richness and diversity, and changing the sward structure.
   Although mulching once a year may prevent invasion by shrubs and trees,
   it also supports the spread of weedy species similar to no management.}},

Title = {{Exploring park visitor perceptions of `flowering bee lawns' in

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{189}},

Abstract = {{Flowering bee lawns integrate low-growing flowers into mowed turfgrass
   to increase the availability of bee forage. They also maintain many of
   the aesthetic and recreational functions of the lawns in urban green
   spaces. Common cultural preferences for uniform, green,
   grass-monoculture lawns may pose a barrier to widespread adoption of
   flowering lawns. However, a growing body of literature suggests that
   there may be a higher degree of acceptance of lawn alternatives, such as
   grass-free lawns or urban meadows, than previously thought. We examined
   park visitors' perceptions of flowering lawns at four parks in
   Minneapolis, U.S. through an on-site questionnaire survey using photos.
   When first asked, 97.2\% of respondents supported implementing flowering
   lawns in public parks. Informing participants that flowering lawns are
   designed to provide bee forage had a polarizing effect where strong
   support increased yet overall support declined slightly. Positive
   perceptions of bees and of flowering lawn appearance were the only two
   significant factors associated with support for flowering lawns in both
   pre- and post-informational intervention logistic regression models.
   Similarly, aesthetics and benefits to bees were the most frequently
   stated perceived benefits. When asked about concerns, the most frequent
   responses were `no concerns' and `reduced recreational use of lawns'.
   For public land managers who wish to add flowering lawns to their suite
   of green infrastructure options to increase forage availability for
   bees, our findings suggest there is widespread public support. Public
   engagement should be carefully crafted to address concerns about
   flowering lawns and reinforce existing positive perceptions.}},

Journal = {{CATENA}},

Volume = {{180}},

Abstract = {{In the wider context of heathland restoration, we investigated how field
   scale experimental acidification with sulphur (sulfur) affected soil
   biodiversity, fertility and function over a period of 17 years. A field
   experiment was conducted in the Isle of Purbeck, England, using ferrous
   sulphate and elemental sulphur as acidifying agents. We tested the
   effects of acidification on soil fertility, plant communities, litter
   decomposition, microbiology (including fungi bacteria and
   actinomycetes), arbuscular and ericoid mycorrhizal colonisation, and
   soil fauna (including earthworms, nematodes, rotifers and tardigrades).
   We found that elemental sulphur had a considerable and persistent effect
   on soil pH, lowering it to levels found in the surrounding reference
   acid grassland and heathland sites. A newly adapted heathland
   restoration index based on soil chemistry, found that elemental sulphur
   was by far the most successful treatment leading to soil conditions
   similar to the heathlands. Overall, acidification caused a loss of base
   cations and an increase in toxic aluminium compounds. Consequently the
   more mesotrophic components of soil biology were reduced by
   acidification during the course of the experiment. This transformed the
   soil biological system into one typical of acid grasslands and
   heathlands. Concomitant litter decomposition was similarly inhibited by
   acidification, with the microbiota more strongly hindered in acidified
   soil than the macroscopic fauna. Acidification resulted in a reduction
   in nematode and rotifer abundance and earthworm biomass. The vegetation
   community was also strongly modified by the elemental sulphur treatments
   and, where grazing was restricted, soil acidification allowed a restored
   heathland community to endure. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonisation of
   grasses was reduced where heather plants were established, while ericoid
   mycorrhizas had developed sufficient populations in the acidified
   pastures to match the colonisation rate in the native heathlands.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem restoration can play a vital role in conserving biodiversity,
   but its effectiveness can be difficult to assess for hyperdiverse biota
   such as insects. Species traits of insects can be used to understand
   their functional responses to restoration, but their use often requires
   considerable effort, and few studies have examined what additional
   insight can be gained from this approach. We used a spatially and
   temporally controlled restoration experiment to examine beetle species,
   grouped by flight ability, family membership and feeding guild, as
   indicators of ecosystem functional change. We tested for the effects of
   reduced vertebrate grazing on beetle assemblages sampled from two
   different microhabitats (next to log and in open ground) one year prior
   and two years after a vertebrate grazing treatment was applied. We
   compared the responses of the different beetle functional groupings, and
   then related these to the effort involved in employing these indicators.
   We found that beetle species traits gave several functional insights
   into their responses to reduced grazing, including responses to changes
   in vegetation structure and biomass. Species richness indicators and
   abundance indicators of beetle functional groups showed similar
   responses in many cases, whereas biomass indicators gave additional
   insights related to the extra biomass of vegetation and detritus
   resulting from the reduction in grazing. We found that most results were
   revealed by using family groups as indicators for functional change.
   This is because the traits that often define beetle families, such as
   size, flight ability and feeding guilds each have distinctive functional
   roles, allowing a link from family to function, and supporting the idea
   that phylogeny is often a useful shortcut to species ecology. We
   conclude that in our study system, the least-cost approach to
   identifying functional responses of beetles to reduced vertebrate
   grazing, and possibly other restoration actions, is to use abundance
   indicators of the most common family groups.}},

Abstract = {{We present a rare long-term management project of annual cutting, hay
   removal and plant species survey on a small Danish freshwater meadow
   (0.6 ha) for an extended period of 21 years. We evaluate whether
   disturbance by hay-cutting could reduce the dominance of tall grasses,
   increase species richness and change the representation of growth
   strategies and Ellenberg indicator values among species. We also
   evaluate whether hay removal could reduce soil fertility and increase
   the proportion of oligotrophic species. We found that species richness
   increased 3-fold over time accompanying a marked decline of vegetation
   height and proportion of tall, clonal grasses. Comparison with an
   adjacent un-cut area confirmed that species richness and evenness
   increased extensively in the plant community by hay-cutting. During the
   first ten years of the restoration period, species richness increased
   for both oligotrophic and eutrophic species, while during the latter 11
   years only small oligotrophic species continued to increase. The
   proportion of Grime's competitive C-strategies and Ellenberg's N indices
   in the community declined over time in accordance with the 50\% decrease
   of organic matter, total and exchangeable phosphorus in the soils. We
   conclude that long-term hay-cutting by disturbance and nutrient removal
   can markedly increase plant biodiversity as well as the representation
   of orchids and small species by breaking the dominance of tall grasses.
   Focused effort over decades can ensure a remarkable high biodiversity
   even in a small area, which will go unnoticed in common short-term
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally managed mountain grasslands are biodiversity hotspots in
   central Europe. However, socio-economic trends in agriculture during the
   last decades have changed farming practices, leaving steep and remote
   sites abandoned. Especially the abandonment of meadows is well known to
   directly affect plant and insect diversity. However, not much is known
   about the effects on soil processes and soil biota. To assess this, we
   studied four extensively managed (mown once a year, no fertilization)
   and four abandoned (no mowing, no fertilization) semi-dry meadows in a
   mountain region in Austria. Plant species richness, plant cover, plant
   traits, plant biomass, litter decomposition (tea bag index), and
   earthworm species richness and density were assessed. Additionally, soil
   temperature, moisture and electrical conductivity were measured. Results
   showed that managed meadows contained more plant species than abandoned
   meadows (118 vs. 93 species, respectively). We also observed different
   plant species assemblages between the two management types. In managed
   meadows, hemirosette and ruderal plant species were more abundant, while
   more plant species without rosettes and a higher plant necromass were
   found in abandoned meadows. Additionally, decomposition rate was higher
   in abandoned meadows. There was a trend towards higher earthworm
   densities in managed meadows, but there was no difference in earthworm
   species richness. We conclude that meadow management has effects on both
   aboveground vegetation and belowground biota and processes. Both
   abandoned and extensively managed meadows were important to sustain
   overall biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in the study region.}},

Title = {{Integrating Surface-Based Temperature and Vegetation Abundance Estimates
   into Land Cover Classifications for Conservation Efforts in Savanna
   Landscapes}},
Journal = {{SENSORS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Southern African savannas are an important dryland ecosystem, as they
   account for up to 54\% of the landscape, support a rich variety of
   biodiversity, and are areas of key landscape change. This paper aims to
   address the challenges of studying this highly gradient landscape with a
   grass-shrub-tree continuum. This study takes place in South Luangwa
   National Park (SLNP) in eastern Zambia. Discretely classifying land
   cover in savannas is notoriously difficult because vegetation species
   and structural groups may be very similar, giving off nearly
   indistinguishable spectral signatures. A support vector machine
   classification was tested and it produced an accuracy of only 34.48\%.
   Therefore, we took a novel continuous approach in evaluating this change
   by coupling in situ data with Landsat-level normalized difference
   vegetation index data (NDVI, as a proxy for vegetation abundance) and
   blackbody surface temperature (BBST) data into a rule-based
   classification for November 2015 (wet season) that was 79.31\% accurate.
   The resultant rule-based classification was used to extract mean
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI values by
   season over time from 2000 to 2016. This showed a distinct separation
   between each of the classes consistently over time, with woodland having
   the highest NDVI, followed by shrubland and then grassland, but an
   overall decrease in NDVI over time in all three classes. These changes
   may be due to a combination of precipitation, herbivory, fire, and
   humans. This study highlights the usefulness of a continuous
   time-series-based approach, which specifically integrates surface
   temperature and vegetation abundance-based NDVI data into a study of
   land cover and vegetation health for savanna landscapes, which will be
   useful for park managers and conservationists globally.}},

Title = {{Amphibian responses to livestock use of wetlands: new empirical data and
   a global review}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Pastureland currently occupies 26\% of Earth's ice-free land surface. As
   the global human population continues to increase and developing
   countries consume more protein-rich diets, the amount of land devoted to
   livestock grazing will only continue to rise. To mitigate the loss of
   global biodiversity as a consequence of the ever-expanding amount of
   land converted from native habitat into pastureland for livestock
   grazing, an understanding of how livestock impact wildlife is critical.
   While previous reviews have examined the impact of livestock on a wide
   variety of taxa, there have been no reviews examining how global
   livestock grazing affects amphibians. We conducted both an empirical
   study in south-central Florida examining the impact of cattle on
   amphibian communities and a quantitative literature review of similar
   studies on five continents. Our empirical study analyzed amphibian
   community responses to cattle as both a binary (presence/absence)
   variable, and as a continuous variable based on cow pie density. Across
   all analyses, we were unable to find any evidence that cattle affected
   the amphibian community at our study site. The literature review
   returned 46 papers that met our criteria for inclusion. Of these
   studies, 15 found positive effects of livestock on amphibians, 21 found
   neutral/mixed effects, and 10 found negative effects. Our quantitative
   analysis of these data indicates that amphibian species that
   historically occurred in closed-canopy habitats are generally negatively
   affected by livestock presence. In contrast, open-canopy amphibians are
   likely to experience positive effects from the presence of livestock,
   and these positive effects are most likely to occur in locations with
   cooler climates and/or greater precipitation seasonality. Collectively,
   our empirical work and literature review demonstrate that under the
   correct conditions well-managed rangelands are able to support diverse
   assemblages of amphibians. These rangeland ecosystems may play a
   critical role in protecting future amphibian biodiversity by serving as
   an ``off-reserve{''} system to supplement the biodiversity conserved
   within traditional protected areas.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient addition and livestock exclosure are two strategies for
   restoring degraded grassland. Although their impacts on plant community
   properties are well understood, the effects of fertilization and
   livestock exclosure on belowground fauna community in degraded grassland
   remain largely unknown. We examined the main and interactive effects of
   nutrient addition and livestock exclosure on soil nematode community in
   a severely degraded grassland of northern China, by recording soil
   nematode community composition in 0- to 10-cm soil layer in the summer
   of 2017. Neither nutrient addition nor livestock exclosure had
   significant effects on the biodiversity of nematode community in this
   degraded grassland. Livestock exclosure significantly increased the
   abundances of total nematodes and the maturity index of the nematode
   community, mainly due to its positive effect on omnivorous + carnivorous
   nematodes. Nutrient addition weakened the positive effects of livestock
   exclosure on soil nematode community by reducing soil pH and enhancing
   soil ammonium concentration. Our results highlight that the positive
   effects of livestock exclosure on soil nematode community would be
   reassessed under the scenarios of nutrient enrichment. Given that most
   grasslands are used for livestock production, the interactive effects of
   grazing and nutrient enrichment on soil nematode community deserve more
   attention in further research.}},

Title = {{Smaller future floods imply less habitat for riparian plants along a
   boreal river}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Climate-change projections suggest large changes in riverine flow
   regime, which will likely alter riparian communities. In northern
   Europe, forecasts propose lower annual spring flood peaks and higher
   winter flows, resulting in narrower riparian zones. To estimate the
   impact of climate change on habitat extent of riparian plants, we
   developed a framework estimating the sensitivity and exposure of
   individual species to streamflow change, and surveyed five reaches along
   the free-flowing Vindel River in northern Sweden. We modeled the
   hydrologic niche of riparian plant species based on the probability of
   occurrence along gradients of flood frequency and duration and used
   predicted future water-level fluctuations (based on climate models and
   IPCC emission scenarios) to calculate changes in flow-related habitat
   availability of individual species. Despite projected increases in
   runoff, we predict most species to decrease in riparian elevational
   extent by on average 12-29\% until the end of the century, depending on
   scenario. Species growing in the upper, spring-flood-controlled part of
   the riparian zone will likely lose most habitat, with the largest
   reductions in species with narrow ranges of inundation duration
   tolerance (decreases of up to 54\%). In contrast, the elevational extent
   of most amphibious species is predicted to increase, but conditions
   creating isoetid vegetation will become rarer or disappear: isoetid
   vegetation is presently found in areas where ice formed in the fall
   settles on the riverbank during the winter as water levels subside.
   Higher winter flows will make these conditions rare. We argue that our
   framework is useful to project the effects of hydrologic change caused
   by climate change as well as other stressors such as flow regulation
   also in other regions. With few rivers remaining unaffected by dams and
   other human stressors, these results call for monitoring to detect
   species declines. Management to alleviate species losses might include
   mitigation of habitat degradation from land-use activities, more
   environmentally friendly flow schemes, and more intensive management
   options such as mowing riparian meadows no longer regularly maintained
   by recurrent floods.}},

Title = {{Stronger dung removal in forests compared with grassland is driven by
   trait composition and biomass of dung beetles}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{1. Ecosystem processes depend on the biomass of the involved organisms,
   but their functional diversity may play an additional role. In
   particular, the exclusion of key functional groups through habitat
   disturbance may lead to the breakdown of ecosystem functions. Dung
   removal is an important process contributing to nutrient cycling and
   thus productivity in grazed ecosystems. 2. This study investigated the
   role of different functional groups of dung beetles in dung removal in
   different habitats within a wood-pasture in two different seasons. An
   experimental setting with 12 blocks and 108 dung pads was used to
   investigate short-term dung removal over 1 week of exposure. 3. Dung
   removal was most strongly affected by habitat type, with almost 40\%
   lower levels in grassland than in adjacent forest and forest gaps. Of
   all assemblage characteristics, total biomass of tunneller species was
   the strongest predictor of dung removal, whereas functional diversity
   showed no significant effect. In accordance with the dung removal
   pattern at habitat type level, densities of large tunnellers were
   suppressed in grassland compared with forest. 4. It is concluded that
   dung removal is habitat-specific and large tunnellers play a
   disproportionate role in this important ecosystem function in temperate
   forests.}},

Abstract = {{Question Water availability is a primary regulator of plant productivity
   and species richness in arid and semi-arid ecosystems, but its influence
   in other habitats is much less clear partly because experimental
   manipulations of water are relatively rare. How important is soil
   moisture availability relative to other key environmental factors in
   determining plant species biomass and diversity in temperate mesic
   grasslands? Location An old-field meadow in southeastern Ontario,
   Canada. Methods We established a long-term factorial field experiment to
   investigate how variation in soil water (achieved by rainout shelters
   and water additions), nutrients (NPK fertilizer additions), and
   above-ground herbivory (deer fence exclosures), interact as regulators
   of plant production, species richness, and species composition.
   Above-ground biomass for each species was determined in replicate plots
   (1 m(2), n = 10) after five years of treatment applications. Results The
   rainout shelters reduced community shoot biomass by 35\% relative to
   ambient (control) plots, with no influence of the fertiliser. To our
   surprise, however, the fertiliser enhanced community biomass in the
   ambient and water addition plots to a similar extent. Species richness
   and Shannon diversity were increased by water addition, but reduced by
   the rainout shelters and by fertilisation. Total species richness across
   all replicate plots was 60\% higher in the water addition treatment, and
   almost halved in the water-reduced treatment. In contrast to the above,
   the exclosures had negligible impacts on these community variables.
   Conclusions Together, these results suggest that in old-field meadow
   grasslands: (a) shoot productivity is primarily limited by soil nutrient
   supply except under drought conditions when water availability becomes
   the primary constraint; (b) the two main soil resources for plants -
   water and nutrients - affect productivity and species
   richness/composition in fundamentally different ways; and (c) future
   increases in summer soil aridity and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition
   may interact to reduce vegetation productivity and diversity in
   temperate mesic ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Is the removal of aboveground shrub biomass an effective technique to
   restore a shrub-encroached grassland?}},
Journal = {{RESTORATION ECOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Encroachment of woody plants into grasslands is a global phenomenon that
   has substantial impacts on pastoral productivity and ecosystem services.
   Over the past half century, pastoralists and land management agencies
   have explored various options to control woody plants in order to
   improve ecosystem services in shrub-encroached grasslands. We examined
   the effectiveness of controlling the encroachment of the shrub Caragana
   microphylla into grassland in Inner Mongolia, China. We cut and removed
   all of the aboveground biomass from 450 shrubs, predicting that the
   effectiveness of this technique to control shrubs would depend on shrub
   morphology. Specifically, we expected that larger shrubs with more
   biomass would be more difficult to kill by cutting than smaller shrubs.
   A year after treatment, we found that cutting killed only 11\% of the
   450 treated shrubs, and of these, three-quarters of the locations that
   they occupied reverted to grasses and one-quarter to bare soil. Shrubs
   that survived the cutting treatment produced more stems and leaf
   biomass, and therefore had a greater leaf to stem ratio. Shrubs that
   died after cutting had a lower crown area and basal area, and less stem
   biomass than shrubs that resprouted within 12 months of cutting. There
   were no effects of shrub height on the fate of treated shrubs. Cutting
   had no effect on understory plant cover or richness, but reproductive
   plants were taller under shrubs that were not cut. Overall, our study
   showed that removing aboveground shrub biomass by cutting is an
   ineffective technique for ``restoring{''} the original grassland
   community unless shrubs are very small. Strategic targeting of small
   shrubs would be a more effective technique for controlling the spread of
   C. microphylla in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{Context Agricultural intensification has led to widespread declines in
   biodiversity. An important component of agricultural intensification in
   many regions, including eastern Ontario, is the shift from grazing lands
   and perennial forage crops to annual row crops, with associated
   increases in use of pesticides. Objectives We predicted that bat
   abundance and diversity would be lower in sites surrounded by landscapes
   with more agriculture and where the agriculture was dominated by annual
   row crops rather than perennial forage crops. Methods We assessed bat
   occurrence and relative bat abundance with acoustic bat recorders at the
   centres of 32 landscapes that varied in (1) the proportion of
   agriculture and (2) the proportion of agriculture that is in annual row
   crops versus perennial forages (pasture and hay). Results Consistent
   with our first prediction, the abundance or presence of four bat
   species, total bat abundance and bat species richness declined with
   increasing agricultural cover in the surrounding landscape. Inconsistent
   with our second prediction, the abundance of three bat species, total
   bat abundance and bat species richness were greatest where the
   proportion of agriculture in annual crops was about equal to the
   proportion in perennial forage in the surrounding landscape. Conclusions
   Based on these results, bat abundance and richness can be increased in
   agricultural landscapes by reducing the conversion of natural areas to
   agriculture and by maintaining a balance of perennial forage and annual
   crop types. We speculate that farmlands with a diversity of crop types
   provide a more temporally stable supply of insect food for bats.}},

Abstract = {{Context Insect herbivores comprise the majority of macroinvertebrate
   communities of temperate grasslands and act as drivers for important
   ecosystem functions. Landscape- and local-level land use may alter
   species pools and dispersal possibilities and act as local environmental
   filters, affecting insect trait composition. Objectives While
   environmental filtering by local land use has repeatedly been shown to
   affect insect community assembly, less is known about the role of
   land-use intensity at the landscape level. We studied the relative
   importance of both local- and landscape-level land use in shaping the
   functional diversity and composition as well as the functional
   beta-diversity among herbivore communities. Methods We used abundance
   data of three main herbivorous insect groups from grasslands across
   three regions in Germany and combined it with data on nine morphometric
   traits related to functions such as dispersal abilities to analyse the
   effects of different land-use components on community assembly. Results
   Land use at both the local and landscape level affected the functional
   composition of insect communities. Some trait combinations were
   particularly sensitive to changes in management intensity, whereas
   others reacted strongly to the availability of suitable habitats in the
   surrounding area. Simultaneously, functional diversity was not affected
   by land use at either spatial level. However, increasing local
   management intensity reduced functional beta-diversity. Conclusions We
   conclude that both local- and landscape-level land use shape the
   functional composition of insect communities. Our results highlight the
   importance of considering land use across multiple spatial scales to
   understand its effects on the functional integrity of herbivore
   communities in temperate grasslands.}},

Title = {{Impact of Year-Round Grazing by Horses on Pasture Nutrient Dynamics and
   the Correlation with Pasture Nutrient Content and Fecal Nutrient
   Composition}},
Journal = {{ANIMALS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary Horse grazing may benefit biodiversity. This study
   compared the effect of horses grazing year-round to that of mowing on
   pasture quality in a forest-grassland landscape in Sweden. Twelve
   Gotlandsruss stallions were kept in three enclosures (similar to 0.35
   horse/hectare) without supplementary feeding for 2.5 years. Each
   enclosure contained three exclosures where pasture was not grazed, but
   mown monthly. Horse grazing increased the diversity of pasture nutrient
   content. Moreover, energy and protein concentrations and grass
   availability increased in areas grazed by horses, but decreased where
   grass was mown. This indicates that year-round grazing can be used to
   increase biodiversity, a suggestion supported by botanical observations.
   Nutrient content in horses' droppings was found to correlate with
   nutrient content in pasture, so analysis of droppings may be used to
   roughly estimate the quality of pasture consumed by horses. Under the
   conditions studied, pasture protein content was sufficient to meet horse
   requirements year-round, while energy content and pasture availability
   may have been limited in winter. Monthly data presented here on the
   nutritive value of pasture can help guide the management of year-round
   grazing systems in the Nordic countries. Horse grazing may benefit
   biodiversity, but the impact of year-round grazing on nutrient dynamics
   has not been evaluated previously. This study compared pasture quality
   in a forest-grassland landscape grazed year-round by horses with that in
   exclosed mown areas. Twelve Gotlandsruss stallions were kept without
   supplementary feeding in three enclosures (similar to 0.35 horse/ha)
   outside Uppsala, Sweden, from May 2014 to September 2016. Each enclosure
   contained three mown exclosures, where grass sward samples were
   collected monthly and analyzed for chemical composition and vegetation
   density. Fecal grab samples were collected and analyzed for crude
   protein (CP) and organic matter (OM) content. There were no differences
   in exclosure pasture energy or CP content between enclosures (p > 0.05).
   In grazed areas, there were differences in grass energy and CP content
   (p > 0.05) between enclosures. During the three summers studied, energy
   and CP content increased in the enclosures, but decreased in the
   exclosures. By the end, biomass content/ha was greater in the enclosures
   than in the exclosures. Fecal OM and CP content showed moderate to
   strong correlations with pasture nutrient content (r = 0.3-0.8, p <
   0.05). Thus, in contrast to monthly mowing, horse grazing diversified
   pasture chemical composition and increased its nutritive value.}},

Abstract = {{Plantations of willow (Salix spp.) are today grown as short-rotation
   coppice (SRC) for the sustainable production of biomass. While
   developing these production systems in the past, much ecological
   knowledge on plant-plant, plant-environment and trophic interactions has
   been generated. This knowledge can contribute to the further development
   of biodiversity-ecosystem function (BEF) theory, which frequently lacks
   a sound understanding of the complex mechanisms behind the observed
   patterns of diversity-productivity relationships. Thus, willow SRC
   systems are suitable models to explore BEF theory; they are simple
   enough to allow the study of the complex ecological mechanisms involved
   and they have many similarities to grassland systems in which much of
   recent BEF theory development has been achieved. This paper briefly
   reviews the current observational and mechanistic knowledge on
   diversity-productivity relationships in willow SRC, as well as the most
   important above- and below-ground trophic interactions that are likely
   to affect them. If the available knowledge is integrated and combined
   with further experimental work targeting mechanisms behind patterns,
   research on willow SRC as a model offers a great opportunity for filling
   the gaps in the understanding what presently hampers the development of
   predictive BEF theory.}},

Abstract = {{Recent decades have seen increased awareness of the double-edged effects
   of grazing. Grazing is necessary for the long-term maintenance of relict
   steppic grasslands but is associated with adverse effects on arthropods.
   Data on spiders are conflicting, and data from steppic grasslands on
   igneous rocks are lacking. We performed a case study on the effects of
   sheep grazing on spiders that inhabit small acidophilous steppic
   grasslands on andesite bedrock. These rare and disappearing grasslands
   are present in central Europe on upper parts of andesite hills due to
   the presence of extreme geophysical conditions combined with the
   pressure of herbivores. Spiders were sampled using pitfall traps and
   sweeping, and the plant cover as well as vascular plant species
   composition were analyzed. We captured a total of 689 individuals of 79
   spider species. The Chao-1-estimated species richness reached 46.5 +/-
   11.6 species at grazed sites and 93.7 +/- 9.9 species at control sites;
   the abundance was also lower at grazed sites. The species composition
   differed in response to grazing (Sorensen similarity index 0.528). Most
   threatened species were present in lower abundance or completely absent
   at the grazed grassland, which was true for all vegetation-dwelling
   threatened spider species. In contrast to the negative response of
   spiders, all threatened plant species except Veronica prostrata were
   more abundant at the grazed grassland. It is likely that grazing as a
   conservation management led to a reduction in spider species richness
   and abundance at the examined central European acidophilous steppic
   grassland on andesite bedrock.}},

Title = {{Novel bird responses to successive, large-scale, landscape
   transformations}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Transformation of intact vegetation into new kinds and configurations of
   human-modified habitats is a well-established driver of biodiversity
   loss. Following initial conversion, many human-dominated landscapes are
   then subject to further large-scale changes in land use. The impacts on
   biodiversity of repeated changes in land use remain poorly known,
   particularly how changes in the matrix interact with initial patterns of
   vegetation clearing. We used an 18-yr study of birds in remnant patches
   of endangered temperate woodland in south-eastern Australia to quantify
   the spatial and temporal effects of successive land use transformation
   in the surrounding landscape. We examined bird response to (1) initial
   patterns of landscape modification (creating semi-cleared grazing land
   dominated by pastures that surrounded remnant woodland patches), (2)
   subsequent establishment and maturation of exotic tree plantations on
   the pastures surrounding woodland patches, and (3) additive and
   interactive effects of both types of landscape transformation. The
   majority of the 57 bird species modeled responded to conversion of
   grazing land to exotic plantations, either independently from initial
   patterns of landscape transformation (20 species), or interactively (18
   species) or additively (15 species) with initial landscape
   transformation. The occurrence of only one species (the Common
   Bronzewing) was related to patterns of initial transformation but not
   subsequent transformation due to plantation establishment. Thus, despite
   many characteristics of the woodland patches within the plantation
   remaining largely unaltered throughout our 18-yr investigation, the
   matrix had a profound effect on the kinds of species inhabiting them,
   with such impacts often magnified over time as the matrix continued to
   change. Plantation establishment triggered new regional-level spatial
   processes with effects on birds detected in woodland patches up to 2 km
   away from the plantation. Matrix conversion selected for species with
   different traits (size, diet and movement patterns) compared to the
   initial transformation, suggesting it is acting as a different filter on
   the bird community. New kinds of landscape transformation (such as
   plantation establishment on previously cleared land) can radically
   affect the species that have persisted for many decades in previously
   modified landscapes. This highlights the challenges, but also
   opportunities, for conserving taxa in ever changing human-dominated
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock is a major driver in most rural landscapes and economics, but
   it also polarises debate over its environmental impacts, animal welfare
   and human health. Conversely, the various services that livestock
   farming systems provide to society are often overlooked and have rarely
   been quantified. The aim of analysing bundles of services is to chart
   the coexistence and interactions between the various services and
   impacts provided by livestock farming, and to identify sets of ecosystem
   services (ES) that appear together repeatedly across sites and through
   time. We review three types of approaches that analyse associations
   among impacts and services from local to global scales: (i) detecting ES
   associations at system or landscape scale, (ii) identifying and mapping
   bundles of ES and impacts and (iii) exploring potential drivers using
   prospective scenarios. At a local scale, farming practices interact with
   landscape heterogeneity in a multi-scale process to shape grassland
   biodiversity and ES. Production and various ES provided by grasslands to
   farmers, such as soil fertility, biological regulations and erosion
   control, benefit to some extent from the functional diversity of
   grassland species, and length of pasture phase in the crop rotation.
   Mapping ES from the landscape up to the EU-wide scale reveals a frequent
   trade-off between livestock production on one side and regulating and
   cultural services on the other. Maps allow the identification of target
   areas with higher ecological value or greater sensitivity to risks.
   Using two key factors (livestock density and the proportion of permanent
   grassland within utilised agricultural area), we identified six types of
   European livestock production areas characterised by contrasted bundles
   of services and impacts. Livestock management also appeared to be a key
   driver of bundles of services in prospective scenarios. These scenarios
   simulate a breakaway from current production, legislation (e.g. the use
   of food waste to fatten pigs) and consumption trends (e.g. halving
   animal protein consumption across Europe). Overall, strategies that
   combine a reduction of inputs, of the use of crops from arable land to
   feed livestock, of food waste and of meat consumption deliver a more
   sustainable food future. Livestock as part of this sustainable future
   requires further enhancement, quantification and communication of the
   services provided by livestock farming to society, which calls for the
   following: (i) a better targeting of public support, (ii) more precise
   quantification of bundles of services and (iii) better information to
   consumers and assessment of their willingness to pay for these services.}},

Abstract = {{High-alpine ecosystems are strongly seasonal and adverse environments.
   In these ecosystems, the brevity of optimal breeding conditions means
   species must efficiently track spatiotemporal variations in resources in
   order to synchronise their reproductive effort with peaks in food
   availability. Understanding the details of prey-habitat associations and
   their seasonality in such ecosystems is thus key for deciphering
   species' ecological niches and developing sound conservation action.
   However, the ecological requirements of high-alpine avifauna remain
   poorly documented. Furthermore, mountain ranges in the Old World are
   affected not only by profound alterations of climate, but also by
   changes in land-use, the interaction of which hampers both proper
   forecasting of species' resilience to environmental change and delivery
   of evidence-based conservation guidance. Here, we investigate the
   prey-habitat associations of a high-alpine passerine, the White-winged
   Snowfinch (Montifringilla nivalis), by radio-tracking breeding adults in
   the Swiss Alps. In late spring and early summer, Snowfinches foraged
   preferentially next to invertebrate-rich, melting snow patches where
   Tipulidae larvae abound. Later, in mid-summer, they favoured flower-rich
   alpine meadows. When foraging, they always preferred short ground
   vegetation while avoiding rock and scree. Their pattern of foraging
   habitat selection reflects trade-offs between food abundance and
   accessibility, i.e. prey availability. The reliance of this passerine on
   a habitat mosaic where snow plays a major role questions its ability to
   cope with climate change due to future habitat loss and potential
   phenological mismatches. Targeted grazing could possibly help in habitat
   management by aiming at maintaining invertebrate-rich meadows with short
   vegetation. Yet, it remains an open question whether habitat management
   would suffice to compensate for the potentially detrimental effects of
   the progressive retreat of snow fields to higher elevations.}},

Abstract = {{1. It is hypothesised that ecological restoration in grasslands can
   induce an alternative stable state shift in vegetation. The change in
   vegetation influences insect community assemblages and allows for
   greater functional redundancy in pollination and refuge for native
   insect species. 2. Insect community assemblages at eight coastal
   California grassland sites were evaluated. Half of these sites had
   undergone restoration through active revegetation of native grassland
   flora and half were non-restored. Insects were collected from Lupinus
   bicolor (Fabaceae) within 2 x 2-m(2) plots in spring 2017. Lupinus
   bicolor is a common native species that is used in California
   restoration projects, and home and state landscaping projects. 3.
   Ordination demonstrated that insect community assemblages were different
   between restored and non-restored sites. These differences were seen in
   insect functional groups as well as taxa-specific differences and were
   found to be driven by environmental characteristics such as non-native
   forb cover. 4. Functional redundancy of herbivores decreased at restored
   sites, while pollinators became more redundant compared with
   non-restored sites. The assemblages of the common species found at
   restoration sites contained more native insects than those found at
   non-restored sites, including species such as Bombus vosnesenskii. 5.
   Local grassland restoration has the potential to induce an alternative
   stable state change and affect insect community assemblages.
   Additionally, it was found that grassland restoration can be a potential
   conservation tool to provide refugia for bumblebees (Bombus), but
   additional studies are required to fully understand its broader
   applicability.}},

Abstract = {{1. Dung beetles perform relevant ecological functions in pastures, such
   as dung removal and parasite control. Livestock farming is the main
   economic activity in the Brazilian Pantanal. However, the impact of
   cattle grazing on the Pantanal's native dung beetle community, and
   functions performed by them, is still unknown. 2. This study evaluated
   the effects of cattle activity on dung beetle community attributes
   (richness, abundance, biomass, composition, and functional group) as
   well as their ecological functions (dung removal and soil bioturbation)
   in the Pantanal. In January/February 2016, dung beetles were sampled and
   their ecological functions measured in 16 sites of native grasslands in
   Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, 10 areas regularly grazed by
   cattle and six control ungrazed areas (> 20 years of abandonment). 3. In
   all, 1169 individuals from 30 species of dung beetles were collected.
   Although abundance, species richness, and biomass did not differ between
   grasslands with and without cattle activity, species composition and
   functional groups differed among systems. Large roller beetles were
   absent from non-cattle grasslands, and the abundance, richness, and
   biomass of medium roller beetles was higher in those systems. 4. Despite
   causing changes in species/functional group composition, the results of
   this study show that a density compensation of functional groups in
   cattle-grazed natural grasslands seems to have conserved the ecological
   functions (dung removal and soil bioturbation), with no significant
   differences between systems. 5. Therefore, these results provide
   evidence that cattle breeding in natural grasslands of the Brazilian
   Pantanal can integrate livestock production with the conservation of the
   dung beetle community and its ecological functions.}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are related to plant community
   dynamics and ecosystem functioning. Overgrazing can negatively affect
   plant performance, and consequently unbalance the association with AMF.
   We studied the grazing effect on AMF colonization for preferred (Bromus
   pictus and Poa ligularis) and unpreferred grasses (Pappostipa speciosa
   and Pappostipa humilis) by sheep in the Patagonian steppe. For each
   species, AMF colonization in ungrazed, moderate and intense grazing
   sites was quantified. In ungrazed areas, B. pictus showed the highest
   extent of AMF colonization. Mycorrhizal colonization was higher during
   the active season, and largely reduced by intense grazing conditions.
   The decrease of AMF colonization was maximal for the most preferred
   species, but also significant for the unpreferred species. Our results
   suggest that overgrazing could reduce mycorrhizal benefits for the plant
   by reduction of AMF colonization, which can be a good indicator of
   ecosystem functioning, eventually revealing an increasing degree of
   environmental degradation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological

Title = {{Indirect effect of nitrogen enrichment modified invertebrate herbivory
   through altering plant community composition in an alpine meadow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{693-702}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Aims
   Nitrogen enrichment may affect `community invertebrate herbivory'
   (hereafter `herbivory') directly by changing plant species' specific
   herbivory, or indirectly by altering the composition of natural plant
   communities. Here, we investigated how community composition altered the
   community herbivory in natural ecosystems and compared the relative
   importance of direct and indirect effects of nitrogen addition on
   community herbivory.
   Methods
   We conducted a 7-year nitrogen addition experiment in an alpine meadow
   to evaluate the effects of fertilization on both herbivory frequency and
   severity, and we divided plants into four functional groups to
   investigate how changes in plant community functional composition affect
   community herbivory frequency. To separate the relative importance of
   direct and indirect effects of fertilization on community herbivory
   frequency, we build a serious of generalized models to select variables
   and used SEM methods to estimate relative contributions of the direct
   and indirect effects.
   Important findings
   We found that nitrogen addition increased community herbivory frequency,
   but not community herbivory severity in our 7-year nitrogen addition
   experiment. Although the most parsimonious model for explaining the
   variation in community herbivory frequency included fixed average of
   herbivory frequency and nitrogen addition, community fixed average of
   herbivory was the best single predictor for community herbivory
   frequency in our study. Changes in fixed average of herbivory frequency
   mediated by plant community composition (indirect effect) outperformed
   changes in species-specific herbivory frequency (direct effect) under
   fertilization in driving community herbivory frequency. Our research
   suggested that indirect effects caused by changes in plant community
   composition played a more important role in invertebrate herbivory under
   the condition of anthropogenic nitrogen enrichment.}},

Abstract = {{Soil and community characteristics, and their driving factors, were
   poorly understood in terms of grazing intensity in alpine meadow regions
   on the Tibetan plateau. We investigated the soil properties and plant
   communities between areas with long-term light grazing (LG), medium
   grazing (MG), and high grazing (HG) intensities. It was revealed that
   grazing activity decreased the soil organic carbon and total nitrogen
   and phosphorus. MG and HG significantly decreased the aboveground
   biomass and species biodiversity of alpine meadows compared with LG. A
   high grazing intensity significantly decreased the species richness
   compared with LG and MG. MG and HG coverage decreased relative to LG.
   The available phosphorus and nitrogen were the main direct positive
   influences stimulating the aboveground biomass of the grassland.
   However, the available nitrogen played an important direct role in
   priming the species richness. Grazing intensity decreased both biomass
   and richness. In conclusion, light grazing provides the most benefits
   for the biomass and species richness of the alpine meadows of the

Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{599-609}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The phryganic and maquis shrublands form the most typical vegetal
   formations in the Eastern Mediterranean that since thousands of years
   have been subject to various types of anthropogenic disturbance,
   including grazing. We studied the impact of sheep and goat grazing on 50
   assemblages of ground spiders (Araneae: Gnaphosidae) in phryganic,
   maquis and forest habitats from zero to 2000 m elevation on Crete,
   Greece using pitfall traps for one year at each sampling site. In total,
   58 gnaphosid species and 16,592 individuals were collected. Cretan
   endemic Gnaphosidae were negatively affected by intensive grazing and,
   contrary to findings on other taxa studied on the island, they were
   sparse and rare throughout the study area. The species composition of
   gnaphosid assemblages was primarily determined by elevation.
   Trachyzelotes lyonneti, Urozelotes rusticus, Zelotes scrutatus,
   Anagraphis pallens and Berinda amabilis proved to be significant
   indicators of overgrazing. The vast majority of spiders belonging to
   synanthropic and nationally red-listed species were found in overgrazed
   sites. Despite theoretical expectations, while the average activity
   density decreased, the number of species, evenness, rarity, taxonomic,
   temporal and functional diversity (FRic) indices increased with
   increasing grazing intensity. This was mainly due to the nature of
   disturbance itself, which probably allows equibalanced low abundances of
   indigenous or synanthropic species, rather than overdominance of few,
   thus partly refuting the opportunistic species hypothesis (OSH). Ground
   spider assemblages in overgrazed sites comprised sparse populations of
   mostly rare, opportunistic species with different combinations of
   life-history traits that partly replace other species more commonly
   found in the less degraded sites. Species of these assemblages shorten
   their phenologies to minimize temporal co-occurrence with each other due
   to resource limitation. These distinct community patterns highlight
   ground spiders as good indicators of grazing pressure on Crete, on
   species and assemblage level. To conserve the indigenous and potentially
   endangered invertebrate fauna, the spatiotemporal discontinuity of
   grazing including rested patches is important in order to maintain
   spatial variability and possibly lead to habitat restoration.}},

Abstract = {{The restoration of biodiversity within previously improved grasslands is
   an important objective worldwide. In some areas farmers receive
   remuneration for using specific strategies but the environmental
   responses to them are still uncertain. This study explored the short and
   long-term impacts of sheep grazing and/or hay cutting on arthropod
   foliage communities and flora within Welsh upland permanent pastures
   (UK). We measured arthropod abundance and diversity plus sward surface
   height, flower numbers and percentage of forbs and grasses. Data were
   collected during summer; twice before hay cutting and once shortly
   after. Total arthropod abundance was higher in grazed plots (due to
   Symphypleona flourishing) and family richness in hay cut plots, but
   taxa-specific responses occurred. Short-term effects reflected
   phenological changes (e.g. in Symphypleona or Cantharidae) and arthropod
   reductions after hay cut, when mostly Diptera remained. Arthropod
   communities were more abundant and diverse in flower-rich and
   forb-dominated plots managed by hay cutting and by hay cutting with
   aftermath grazing, although certain groups flourished in grazed only
   grass-dominated plots. The two managements based on a hay cut provided
   more heterogeneous environmental conditions than other management
   treatments, and these supported more diverse arthropod communities. The
   results make a valuable addition to the evidence base on which to base
   future land use policy at a time when tradeoffs between agricultural
   production and nature conservation are under scrutiny across Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing is an important modulator of both plant productivity and
   biodiversity in grassland community, yet how to determine a suitable
   grazing intensity in alpine grassland is still controversy. Here, we
   explore the effects of different grazing intensities on plant biomass
   and species composition, both at community level and functional group
   level, and examines the productivity-species richness relationship under
   four grazing patterns: no grazing (CK), light grazing (LG), moderate
   grazing, (MG) and heavy grazing (HG), attempt to determine a suitable
   grazing intensity in alpine grassland. The results were as follows. The
   total aboveground biomass (AGB) reduced with increasing grazing
   intensity, and the response of plant functional groups was different.
   AGB of both sedges and legumes increased from MG to HG, while the AGB of
   forbs reduced sharply and the grass AGB remained steady. There was a
   significant positive relationship between productivity and species
   richness both at community level and functional group level. In
   contrast, the belowground biomass (BGB) showed a unimodal relationship
   from CK to HG, peaking in MG (8,297.72 +/- 621.29 g/m(2)).
   Interestingly, the grassland community tends to allocate more root
   biomass to the upper soil layer under increasing grazing intensities.

Title = {{Urban meadows as an alternative to short mown grassland: effects of
   composition and height on biodiversity}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There are increasing calls to provide greenspace in urban areas, yet the
   ecological quality, as well as quantity, of greenspace is important.
   Short mown grassland designed for recreational use is the dominant form
   of urban greenspace in temperate regions but requires considerable
   maintenance and typically provides limited habitat value for most taxa.
   Alternatives are increasingly proposed, but the biodiversity potential
   of these is not well understood. In a replicated experiment across six
   public urban greenspaces, we used nine different perennial meadow
   plantings to quantify the relative roles of floristic diversity and
   height of sown meadows on the richness and composition of three
   taxonomic groups: plants, invertebrates, and soil microbes. We found
   that all meadow treatments were colonized by plant species not sown in
   the plots, suggesting that establishing sown meadows does not preclude
   further locally determined grassland development if management is
   appropriate. Colonizing species were rarer in taller and more diverse
   plots, indicating competition may limit invasion rates. Urban meadow
   treatments contained invertebrate and microbial communities that
   differed from mown grassland. Invertebrate taxa responded to changes in
   both height and richness of meadow vegetation, but most orders were more
   abundant where vegetation height was longer than mown grassland. Order
   richness also increased in longer vegetation and Coleoptera family
   richness increased with plant diversity in summer. Microbial community
   composition seems sensitive to plant species composition at the soil
   surface (0-10 cm), but in deeper soils (11-20 cm) community variation
   was most responsive to plant height, with bacteria and fungi responding
   differently. In addition to improving local residents' site
   satisfaction, native perennial meadow plantings can produce biologically
   diverse grasslands that support richer and more abundant invertebrate
   communities, and restructured plant, invertebrate, and soil microbial
   communities compared with short mown grassland. Our results suggest that
   diversification of urban greenspace by planting urban meadows in place
   of some mown amenity grassland is likely to generate substantial
   biodiversity benefits, with a mosaic of meadow types likely to maximize
   such benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland ecosystems are one of the most important terrestrial
   ecosystems in the world, producing essential both goods and ecosystem
   services (ES) for human beings. The Inner Mongolian steppe is a major
   grassland ecosystem in Northern China, covering 13.5\% of the northern
   Chinese grassland area, and playing important ecological roles for the
   adjacent region of the capital Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei. Quantification of
   grassland ES under the different utilization patterns is vital for the
   maintenance of multiple ES and mitigation against ES loss in this
   region. We made a manipulative experiment with four grazing intensities
   (grazing exclusion, GE; light grazing intensity, LG; medium grazing
   intensity, MG; heavy grazing intensity, HG). We then quantified the
   intensities of eight different grassland ES (1. herbage intake, HT; 2.
   biodiversity conservation, BI; 3. soil nutrient retention, SN; 4 soil
   carbon stocks SC; 5. soil erosion prevention, SEP; 6. soil water
   storage, SWC; 7. potential nutrient recycling, PNC; 8. carbon
   sequestration from atmosphere. CS) and total ES via a series of field
   measurements. Pearson coefficients and trade-offs index were used to
   access the above ES relationships and degree of trade-offs between ES.
   Grazing intensities significantly (p < 0.05) affected the grassland
   intensities of `egulating', `culture' and `provisioning' services, but
   the `supporting' services. We found three types of relationships
   (trade-offs, synergy or neutral) have been found in this study.
   Trade-offs occurred between `provisioning' and `regulating' services.
   Although GE management presented significantly higher intensity of total
   ES (0.64) than LG (0.52), LG management significantly weakened the
   trade-offs between `provisioning' and `regulating' services (Trade-offs
   index 0.22) in comparison with GE (Trade-offs index 11.02). Our study
   suggests, therefore, that LG is the most suitable grassland utilization
   practice in the Inner Mongolian steppe. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The interaction between plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in the
   rhizosphere plays a vital role in driving vegetation recovery and
   restoration of soil nutrients. However, how this interaction affects
   vegetation succession and how soil nutrient recovery is driven by
   vegetation restoration and rhizosphere processes are still largely
   unknown. In this study, a well-documented grassland restoration
   chronosequence on the Loess Plateau, China (fields at 0, 7, 12, 17, 22,
   and 32 years after farmland abandonment and a natural grassland
   reference) was selected. The species richness and diversity reached
   maximum values between 17 and 22 years after farmland abandonment,
   whereas the plant total above and belowground biomasses simultaneously
   peaked at 22 years and then remained stable. In the dominant plant
   rhizosphere and bulk soil concentrations of total glomalin-related soil
   protein (including both old and recently produced fungal proteins)
   substantially increased from 3.58 to 4.87 g kg(-1) and from 2.67 to 3.86
   g kg(-1), respectively, between 12 and 32 years after farmland
   abandonment. The concentrations of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total
   nitrogen (TN) in the plant rhizosphere and bulk soil significantly
   increased between 17 and 32 years and reached the levels of the natural
   grassland. The aboveground plant biomass, soil SOC, and TN
   concentrations were positively correlated with the glomalin-related soil
   protein (GRSP) concentration (p < .05). Our study suggested that
   interactions among plant-mycorrhizae association, plant diversity, and
   biomass promote GRSP and nutrient accumulation in the plant rhizosphere
   and bulk soil, and GRSP largely contributes to SOC stabilization and the
   accumulation of SOC and TN.}},

Title = {{Changes in bird assemblages because of vegetation homogenisation in
   communal vestock systems}},
Journal = {{KOEDOE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 17}},
Abstract = {{Protected areas are intended to promote biodiversity representation and
   persistence; yet, whether they are effective in degraded landscapes
   where much of the original vegetation structure remains intact has
   received relatively little attention. We test whether avian assemblages
   in communal rangelands in savannas differ from savannas supporting a
   full complement of native herbivores and predators. Birds were surveyed
   in 36 transect counts conducted over 18 days. We also compare the
   vegetation structure between the two land-use types to assess whether
   differences in bird assemblages could be attributed to changes in
   vegetation structure. Bird assemblages were richer, had greater
   abundances and different compositions inside protected areas than
   rangelands. The median body mass of birds was larger inside than outside
   protected areas, and rangelands supported fewer grassland specialists,
   but more closed-canopy specialists. However, no differences in feeding
   guild composition were found between protected areas and communal
   rangelands. Additionally, vegetation structure, but not richness,
   differed between protected areas and communal rangelands: communal
   rangelands had higher densities of woody vegetation and shorter grass
   height than the protected areas. Our findings suggest that the altered
   vegetation structure in communal grazing camps has led to changes in the
   species richness and composition of bird communities and has been
   selected by closed-canopy specialists at the cost of open grassy
   specialists. Hunting in communal rangelands is likely to have resulted
   in the loss of large birds and in reductions in bird abundance in the
   rangelands. Therefore, land-use management that does not lead to
   irreversible landscape transformation can nevertheless result in changes
   in the diversity, composition and functioning of native assemblages.
   Conservation implications: Savanna landscapes that are degraded, but not
   transformed, support fewer bird species, fewer open habitat specialists
   and smaller birds because of vegetation homogenisation.}},

Abstract = {{The microbes contained within free-living organisms can alter host
   growth, reproduction, and interactions with the environment. In turn,
   processes occurring at larger scales determine the local biotic and
   abiotic environment of each host that may affect the diversity and
   composition of the microbiome community. Here, we examine variation in
   the diversity and composition of the foliar fungal microbiome in the
   grass host, Andropogon gerardii, across four mesic prairies in the
   central United States. Composition of fungal endophyte communities
   differed among sites and among individuals within a site, but was not
   consistently affected by experimental manipulation of nutrient supply to
   hosts (A. gerardii) or herbivore reduction via fencing. In contrast,
   mean fungal diversity was similar among sites but was limited by total
   plant biomass at the plot scale. Our work demonstrates that distributed
   experiments motivated by ecological theory are a powerful tool to
   unravel the multiscale processes governing microbial community
   composition and diversity.}},

Title = {{Herbivore corridors sustain genetic footprint in plant populations: a
   case for Spanish drove roads}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to biodiversity
   conservation and ecosystem productivity mediated by direct human impact.
   Its consequences include genetic depauperation, comprising phenomena
   such as inbreeding depression or reduction in genetic diversity. While
   the capacity of wild and domestic herbivores to sustain long-distance
   seed dispersal has been proven, the impact of herbivore corridors in
   plant population genetics remains to be observed. We conducted this
   study in the Conquense Drove Road in Spain, where sustained use by
   livestock over centuries has involved transhumant herds passing twice a
   year en route to winter and summer pastures. We compared genetic
   diversity and inbreeding coefficients of Plantago lagopus populations
   along the drove road with populations in the surrounding agricultural
   matrix, at varying distances from human settlements. We observed
   significant differences in coefficients of inbreeding between the drove
   road and the agricultural matrix, as well as significant trends
   indicative of higher genetic diversity and population nestedness around
   human settlements. Trends for higher genetic diversity along drove roads
   may be present, although they were only marginally significant due to
   the available sample size. Our results illustrate a functional landscape
   with human settlements as dispersal hotspots, while the findings along
   the drove road confirm its role as a pollinator reservoir observed in
   other studies. Drove roads may possibly also function as linear
   structures that facilitate long-distance dispersal across the
   agricultural matrix, while local P. lagopus populations depend rather on
   short-distance seed dispersal. These results highlight the role of
   herbivore corridors for conserving the migration capacity of plants, and
   contribute towards understanding the role of seed dispersal and the
   spread of invasive species related to human activities.}},

Abstract = {{Conversion of natural woodlands to grazing pastures is a major driver of
   biodiversity loss. In response to this threat, regenerative management
   approaches have been proposed to balance agriculture with biodiversity
   conservation. Yet rigorous experiments investigating the effectiveness
   of such approaches are rare. We used time-series data from a broad-scale
   experiment in south-eastern Australian woodlands to explore the effects
   of agricultural practices and environmental factors on regeneration,
   bare ground, and native and exotic cover and richness. Our study
   included historical fertilization, three past grazing regimes
   (continuous, short-conversion rotational, and long-conversion
   rotational), two present-day grazing measures (grazing duration and
   stocking rate), and three environmental covariates (natural soil
   fertility, native woody cover, and rainfall). We found that fertilizer
   application was associated with altered trajectories of native
   overstorey cover, native plant richness, exotic cover, and bare ground.
   Changes in woodland condition also were associated with a combination of
   present-day grazing and environmental drivers. Natural regeneration,
   native plant richness, and native herb cover were negatively associated
   with increased grazing intensity. Conversely, increased landscape-scale
   native woody cover and local-scale natural soil fertility were
   associated with increases in native overstorey cover and native plant
   richness and decreases in exotic cover and bare ground. Our results
   indicate that land-use history, present grazing intensity, and landscape
   context alter woodland ecosystem responses to intervention. This may
   explain why some conservation actions fail to meet objectives. Our
   results indicate that the effectiveness of conservation actions can be
   improved by considering the combined influence of past and present
   agricultural management and landscape context on woodland condition.}},

Title = {{Testing relationship between plant productivity and diversity in a

Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{The rapid global plant diversity and productivity loss has resulted in
   ecosystem functional degeneration in recent decades, and the
   relationship between plant diversity and productivity is a pressing
   issue around the world. Here, we sampled six plant communities that have
   not been grazed for 20 years, i.e., Agropyron mongolicum, Stipa
   bungeana, Cynanchum komarovii, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Sophora
   alopecuroides, Artemisia ordosica, located in a desertified steppe,
   northwestern China, and tested the relationship between plant diversity
   and productivity in this region. We found a positive linear relationship
   between AGB (above-ground biomass) and BGB (below-ground biomass), and
   the curves between plant diversity and AGB were unimodal (R-2 = 0.4572,
   p < 0.05), indicating that plant productivity increased at a low level
   of diversity but decreased at a high level of diversity. However, there
   was no significant relationship between BGB and plant diversity (p >
   0.05). Further, RDA (redundancy analysis) indicated that soil factors
   had a strong effect on plant diversity and productivity. Totally, GAMs
   (generalized additive models) showed that soil factors (especially total
   nitrogen TN, total carbon TC, soil microbial biomass nitrogen SMB-N,
   soil microbial biomass carbon SMB-C) explained more variation in plant
   diversity and productivity (78.24\%), which can be regarded as the key
   factors driving plant diversity and productivity. Therefore, strategies
   aiming to increase plant productivity and protect plant diversity may
   concentrate on promoting soil factors (e.g., increasing TC, TN, SMB-N
   and SMB-C) and plant species, which can be regarded as an effective and
   simple strategy to stabilize ecosystems to mitigate aridity in
   desertified steppes in northwestern China.}},

Abstract = {{Subtropical Campos Sulinos grasslands, in South Brazil, are among the
   most biodiverse grasslands of the world. As climatic conditions lead to
   high productivity, disturbance are critical to maintain their diversity.
   Long-term exclusion, on the other hand, leads to plant species losses
   and changes in composition. No studies on the restoration of these
   grasslands after abandonment exist to date. We tested combinations of
   restoration techniques with the aim of increasing plant diversity in an
   abandoned and species-poor grassland in the South Brazilian highland
   region. In a bi-factorial experiment, we tested the effects of two
   different frequencies of mowing and of hay transfer. Mowing reduced
   plant cover, vegetation height, and abundance of erect grasses and
   shrubs, and increased species richness, diversity (Shannon diversity
   index) and prostrate forb and grass cover. No differences were found
   between mowing frequencies. Hay transfer was not effective at
   reintroducing species. The results of the present study provide further
   evidence that the reintroduction of plants is a major challenge in the
   restoration of subtropical and tropical grasslands. The study shows that
   mowing is a fast way to increase plant diversity in Campos Sulinos after
   long periods of abandonment.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{279}},
Pages = {{25-32}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{With rapid changes in climate conditions and grazing regimes, a decline
   in soil quality has become a main challenge for sustainability of
   Tibetan rangeland. Increasing evidence highlights the significance of
   plant biomass, but few studies test the role of realistic loss of plant
   diversity in impacting soil quality. We hypothesized that loss of
   species diversity will decrease soil quality, not only through lost
   standing biomass (i.e., ``mass effect{''}) but also directly via the
   loss of the ``diversity effect{''}. Considering the realistic loss of
   species diversity following overgrazing, grazing exclusion and climate
   change, we experimentally removed grass, sedge and various forb species
   from a Tibetan alpine meadow to test this hypothesis. After target plant
   species had been removed for five years, we examined the effect of the
   species removal on the plant community and soil quality with Bayesian
   linear mixed effect models and inferred potentially causal linkages
   between plants and soil with a Bayesian network. Results showed (i)
   overall, plant species removal not only significantly decreased plant
   diversity and standing biomass but also decreased soil organic matter
   and nutrients; (ii) the standing biomass decreased more pronouncedly in
   response to the removal of sedge and grass species, but plant diversity
   and soil nutrients decreased more pronouncedly in response to the
   removal of various forb species; and (iii) the loss of species diversity
   rather than standing biomass was directly associated with the decline in
   the-soil quality, especially a decrease in soil available P. In short,
   our results indicate that realistic loss of plant species diversity can
   decrease soil quality in a Tibetan alpine meadow through lost the
   ``diversity effect{''}. The functional significance of plant species
   diversity in maintaining soil quality supports the expectation of local
   pastoralists that diverse plants, promoted by traditionally rotational
   grazing, can ensure the sustainability of alpine soil and Tibetan
   rangeland.}},

Abstract = {{A great number of ecological conservation and restoration projects have
   been implemented to prevent the deterioration of alpine grasslands on
   the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. However, few researches have documented the
   effects of ecological projects on the improvement of ecosystem services
   of alpine grasslands based on field investigations. In this study, 24
   plots of alpine meadow along different succession times were
   investigated to estimate the impacts of ecological restoration on four
   key ecosystem services (i.e., soil organic carbon sequestration (SOCS),
   soil total nitrogen sequestration (STNS), biodiversity, and aboveground
   biomass) in the Glog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Qinghai Province,
   China. The results showed that STNS and biodiversity of degraded alpine
   meadows were significantly improved through restoration actions, while
   SOCS and aboveground biomass didn't change. The relationships of above-
   and belowground ecosystem services changed over restoration time.
   Trade-offs between aboveground biomass and biodiversity, between
   aboveground biomass and SOCS at stage III were significantly improved,
   in contrast to those at stage I. Trade-off between STNS and biodiversity
   at stage II was significantly increased, in contrast to those at stage
   I. Economic profit of ecological restoration was insignificantly changed
   along restoration time. Our results suggested that human-induced
   restoration was a feasible approach to improve the ecological and
   economical values of ``Black Beach{''} on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,
   and further restoration actions and long-term research are required to
   enhance the ecosystem services of revegetated degraded meadow.}},

Title = {{Impacts of holistic planned grazing with bison compared to continuous

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},

Abstract = {{We assess holistic planned grazing outcomes in shortgrass prairie of the
   Northern Great Plains of North America. We compared key ecosystem
   functions on the ranch managed using adaptive multi-paddocks (AMP)
   grazing by bison with those on neighboring ranch paddocks managed using
   set stocked light continuous (LCG) and heavy continuous grazing (HCG)
   grazed by cattle. Sites on the neighboring ranches in each grazing
   category were paired for sampling by soil type and landscape position.
   In all paddocks, management practices had been constant for more than a
   decade. Positive results with AMP grazing include increased fine litter
   cover (P < 0.05), improved water infiltration (P < 0.06), two to three
   times the available forage biomass (P < 0.001), improved plant
   composition (P < 0.05), decrease in invasive plants (P < 0.05), and
   decrease in bare ground (P < 0.05). Higher infiltration occurred with
   AMP on soils having higher permeability but not on soils having a high
   clay content. Differences were greatest between AMP and HCG management
   with LCG being intermediate. Counterintuitively, herbaceous biomass in
   LCG was less than that of the more heavily stocked HCG (P < 0.05). This
   was due to decades of heavy continuous grazing resulting in HCG being
   dominated by invasive herbaceous plants of no forage value in contrast
   to LCG paddocks that had a greater proportion of palatable forages. The
   HCG paddocks were dominated by unpalatable invasive plants that were
   avoided by cattle. Soil carbon stocks increased under the AMP grazing
   but not on all soils. Total carbon stocks (TC), summing organic carbon
   and inorganic carbon, were not different between the AMP and LCG grazing
   strategies (P > 0.63) but both had higher TC values across all soils
   than HCG (P < 0.001). There were no differences in TC among grazing
   treatments on the different soils (P > 0.46) except on the Norrest silty
   clay loam soil that had the highest permeability. On this soil there
   were differences between AMP and HCG (P < 0.0001) and LCG and HCG (P <
   0.0001). There were significantly lower TC levels at all soil depths
   with HCG than with AMP and LCG (P < 0.05). Using holistic planned
   grazing protocols with AMP grazing effectively limited overstocking and
   over-grazing by adjusting animal numbers to match available forage
   amounts and grazing for short periods followed by adequate recovery
   after grazing. This study indicated ecological improvements by AMP
   grazing on the 777 Bison Ranch compared to HCG pastures is contributing
   to improvements in this semi-arid short grass ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{The natural form of feeding for all herbivorous species is grazing.
   Primarily local breeds should be grazed on natural grasslands, as they
   are resistant to adverse weather conditions, are likely to get
   nutritional requirements fulfilled on the grazing, and are highly
   resistant to disease. The aim of the study was to determine the effect
   of the means and intensity of use of permanent grasslands on vegetation
   and its nutritional value in the context of animal welfare. We
   hypothesized that natural grazing of animals contributes to the
   preservation of high floristic diversity in areas of natural value. The
   research was conducted in 2016 in a mountainous region (500-600 m above
   sea level) directly adjacent to Magura National Park (Southern Poland,
   DMS: 49 degrees 31'47.944 `' N 21 degrees 30'25.747 `' E) and
   constituting its buffer zone. Extensive grazing of local livestock
   (sheep and cattle) was shown to have a positive impact on their welfare
   and on the biodiversity of grassland ecosystems by preventing secondary
   forest succession, and it can be used in areas of natural value for
   active nature conservation. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Under natural conditions, aboveground herbivory and plant-soil feedbacks
   (PSFs) are omnipresent interactions strongly affecting individual plant
   performance. While recent research revealed that aboveground insect
   herbivory generally impacts the outcome of PSFs, no study tested to what
   extent the intensity of herbivory affects the outcome. This, however, is
   essential to estimate the contribution of PSFs to plant performance
   under natural conditions in the field. Here, we tested PSF effects both
   with and without exposure to aboveground herbivory for four common grass
   species in nine grasslands that formed a gradient of aboveground
   invertebrate herbivory. Without aboveground herbivores, PSFs for each of
   the four grass species were similar in each of the nine grasslands-both
   in direction and in magnitude. In the presence of herbivores, however,
   the PSFs differed from those measured under herbivory exclusion, and
   depended on the intensity of herbivory. At low levels of herbivory, PSFs
   were similar in the presence and absence of herbivores, but differed at
   high herbivory levels. While PSFs without herbivores remained similar
   along the gradient of herbivory intensity, increasing herbivory
   intensity mostly resulted in neutral PSFs in the presence of herbivores.
   This suggests that the relative importance of PSFs for plant-species
   performance in grassland communities decreases with increasing intensity
   of herbivory. Hence, PSFs might be more important for plant performance
   in ecosystems with low herbivore pressure than in ecosystems with large
   impacts of insect herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Forest succession can influence herbivore communities through changes in
   host availability, plant quality, microclimate, canopy structure
   complexity and predator abundance. It is not well known, however, if
   such influence is constant across years. Caterpillars have been reported
   to be particularly susceptible to changes in plant community composition
   across forest succession, as most species are specialists and rely on
   the presence of their hosts. Nevertheless, in the case of tropical dry
   forests, plant species have less defined successional boundaries than
   tropical wet forests, and hence herbivore communities should be able to
   persist across different successional stages. To test this prediction,
   caterpillar communities were surveyed during eight consecutive years in
   a tropical dry forest in four replicated successional stages in Chamela,
   Jalisco and Mexico. Lepidopteran species richness and diversity were
   equivalent in mature forests and early successional stages, but a
   distinctive caterpillar community was found for the recently abandoned
   pastures. Species composition tended to converge among all four
   successional stages during the span of eight years. Overall, our results
   highlight the importance of both primary and secondary forest for the
   conservation of caterpillar biodiversity at a landscape level. We also
   highlight the relevance of long-term studies when assessing the
   influence of forest succession to account for across year variation in
   species interactions and climatic factors. in French is available with

Abstract = {{Aims To restore species-rich grasslands on former agricultural land,
   typically phosphorus-poor soil conditions need to be re-established.
   Here we assess the potential of phosphorus extraction by biomass
   production, i.e. phytomining. We compare two techniques: (i) `mowing',
   i.e. cutting and removing hay two or three times a year, and (ii)
   `P-mining', i.e. mowing with yield maximization by adding
   growth-limiting nutrients other than phosphorus (i.e. nitrogen and
   potassium).
   Methods In a five-year field experiment at three fields situated along a
   soil phosphorus gradient, we studied phosphorus removal through both
   biomass assessment and changes in two soil phosphorus pools:
   bioavailable phosphorus (P-Olsen) and slowly cycling phosphorus
   (P-Oxalate).
   Results Phosphorus-mining doubled the phosphorus removal with biomass
   compared to mowing, and phosphorus removal with biomass was lower at
   fields with an initially lower concentration of P-Olsen in the soil. The
   P-Olsen concentrations decreased significantly during the experiment
   with the largest decreases in phosphorus-rich plots. Changes in the
   P-Olsen and P-Oxalate stocks were correlated with the amount of
   phosphorus removed with biomass.
   Conclusions Phosphorus-mining effectively increases phosphorus removal
   compared to mowing, but becomes less efficient with decreasing soil
   phosphorus concentrations. Restoring phosphorus-poor soil conditions on
   formerly fertilized land remains a challenge: phytomining most often
   needs a long-term commitment.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands occur around the globe and, in temperate regions, their
   natural management by fire, drought and wild herbivores has largely been
   replaced by grazing with domestic livestock. Successful management for
   agriculture is not always suitable for conservation and can have a
   detrimental effect on biodiversity. Conservation grazing of saltmarshes,
   delivered through agri-environment schemes, may provide a solution to
   counteract biodiversity loss by providing farmers with financial
   incentives to graze these internationally important coastal wetlands
   more sensitively. To assess whether conservation grazing is being
   achieved and whether agri-environment schemes are effective in
   delivering this management, we conducted a national survey on English
   saltmarshes, scoring the management on each site as optimal, suboptimal
   or detrimental in terms of suitability for achieving conservation aims
   for five aspects of grazing: presence, stock type, intensity, timing and
   habitat impact. Although most saltmarshes suitable for grazing in
   England were grazed, conservation grazing was not being achieved. Sites
   under agri-environment management for longer did score higher and
   approached optimal levels in terms of grazing intensity in one region,
   but sites with agri-environment agreements were no more likely to be
   grazed at optimal conservation levels than sites without them overall,
   indicating that agri-environment schemes, in their current form, are an
   ineffective delivery mechanism for conservation grazing on saltmarsh.
   The low specificity of agri-environment prescription wording may
   contribute to this failure, with prescriptions either being vague or
   specifying suboptimal or detrimental management objectives, particularly
   for grazing intensity, timing and stock type. These objectives are often
   set too high or too low, during unsuitable periods or using stock types
   inappropriate for achieving conservation aims. Synthesis and
   applications. Our national survey indicates that agri-environment
   schemes are not currently delivering conservation grazing on English
   saltmarshes. Agri-environment schemes are the only mechanism through
   which such grazing can be implemented on a national scale, so improving
   their effectiveness is a priority. Policymakers, researchers and
   managers need to work together to ensure better translation of
   conservation guidelines into schemes, increasing the specificity of
   management prescriptions and improving understanding of the need for
   management measures. A more detailed and reliable system of auditing to
   ensure that management activities are taking place would be beneficial
   or alternatively moving to a results-based scheme where payments are
   made on desirable outcomes rather than on evidence of management.}},

Abstract = {{Mitigating the detrimental impacts of intensive farming on biodiversity
   requires the implementation of cost-effective conservation actions.
   Targeted agri-environment schemes (AESs) to enhance populations of
   threatened species inhabiting farmland have been proposed for this
   purpose, yet their effectiveness for nocturnal wildlife remains unknown.
   We assessed whether hedgerow management prescribed by targeted AESs to
   improve habitat conditions for the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus
   ferrumequinum) in England may positively influence the species, the
   entire bat assemblage and the insect prey of bats. We specifically
   investigated the responses of bats (occurrence, activity and species
   richness) and insects (biomass, abundance and diversity) to time since
   last trimming (from 1 up to 10 years). We explored the mechanisms
   underlying the effects of AES via changes in trimming regime on bats.
   Moreover, we investigated the effects of landscape context on bats as we
   expected that highly mobile species would benefit further from
   landscape-scale management. Bat species richness significantly increased
   with time since last trimming. Three bat taxa of major conservation
   concern in Western Europe substantially benefited from the targeted
   prescription, namely R. ferrumequinum, Rhinolophus hipposideros and
   Plecotus spp. Insect family richness and dipteran abundance were also
   significantly greater at hedgerows that were untrimmed for at least 3
   years. The activity of more common bat species (i.e. pipistrelle bats)
   was not influenced by time since last trimming. Changes in trimming
   regime strongly affected hedgerow height which directly and indirectly
   (by increasing prey abundance) influenced bat occurrence, activity and
   species richness along hedgerows. The activity of highly mobile bat
   species was mainly associated with a range of landscape attributes. The
   amount of semi-natural grassland within 0.5 km of the sampling sites
   positively influenced R. ferrumequinum while the presence of urban areas
   negatively affected light-sensitive bat species. Synthesis and
   applications. The implementation of targeted agri-environment schemes
   can include effective measures to enhance bats and their insect prey in
   farmland. Although we highlight the success of current prescriptions on
   hedgerow management, we suggest that their effectiveness can easily be
   optimized by encouraging farmers to keep hedgerows untrimmed for longer
   periods (>3 up to 10 years). We also highlight that a multi-scale
   management approach is required to successfully promote bats in
   farmland.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing at low stocking rates is widely recommended to
   maintain grassland biodiversity. However, empirical evidence of
   grazing-intensity effects on plant diversity is contradictory.
   Explicitly considering the small-scale heterogeneity of short,
   frequently grazed and tall, rarely grazed patches typical of low-input
   grazing systems may be crucial to the understanding of paddock-scale
   grazing effects. We studied three patch types (short, intermediate,
   tall) within an unfertilised long-term cattle grazing experiment in
   Lower Saxony, Germany, comparing three paddock-scale grazing
   intensities. We analysed soil nutrient concentrations and recorded
   vegetation composition at a total of 135 plots. We determined species
   richness, Simpson diversity, Simpson evenness and beta diversity of
   individual plots (plot scale) and patch types within paddocks (patch
   scale). To quantify paddock-scale diversity, we resampled plot-scale
   species composition across a gradient of relative proportions of short
   and tall patches within a paddock. Patch type, not paddock-scale grazing
   intensity, was the main driver of plant diversity at both plot and patch
   scale. Short patches were more diverse than tall patches, but the effect
   was not strongly mediated by the lower soil nutrient concentrations in
   the short patches. By contrast, both patch type and grazing intensity
   affected vegetation composition at plot and patch scale. Beta-diversity
   within and between patch types was independent of grazing intensity;
   consequently, paddock-scale diversity was determined by the relative
   proportion of short versus tall patches. Higher alpha diversity of short
   patches compared to tall patches was more important than beta diversity
   between the two patch types in shaping paddock-scale diversity.
   Consequently, with increasing short-patch proportion, paddock-scale
   diversity increased. Synthesis and applications. Our study identifies
   the grazing-induced patch structure as the most important driver of
   plant diversity across different grazing intensities in low-input, that
   is, unfertilised and continuously stocked, pastures. To optimise grazing
   management for biodiversity, understanding plant-diversity responses to
   grazing at the patch scale is indispensable. Our results suggest that,
   in unfertilised, continuously stocked European pastures, trade-offs
   between biodiversity and agronomic production may be small, as short
   patches, whose proportion increases with stocking rate, also had the
   highest plant diversity.}},

Volume = {{56}},

Abstract = {{Successful restoration of semi-natural grasslands on grasslands
   previously subject to intensive management needs to overcome manifold
   barriers. These include high soil fertility, the dominance of a few
   fast-growing plant species, degraded soil faunal communities and missing
   propagules of the targeted above- and below-ground flora and fauna. A
   combination of removing the topsoil and introducing propagules of target
   plants has become one of the major tools for nature conservation
   agencies and practitioners to reduce soil fertility and restore former
   species-rich grasslands in various European countries. Using topsoil
   removal as a restoration measure has provoked an ongoing debate between
   supporting nature conservation and rejecting soil protection agencies.
   Although it favours species-rich plant communities, it strongly disturbs
   soil communities and affects physical and chemical soil properties and
   processes. Currently, there is a lack of long-term data to assess how
   restored grassland ecosystems develop and recover after topsoil removal.
   Here, we used two well-established bioindicators, soil nematodes and
   plants, to quantify restoration success of topsoil removal in comparison
   with alternative restoration measures and target communities 22 years
   after intervention. The nematode community composition indicated reduced
   nutrient availability in the restored systems, as was aimed at by
   topsoil removal. Nevertheless, after this 22-year period following
   topsoil removal, nematode composition and structure revealed successful
   recovery. Plant communities benefitted from the reduction of soil
   nutrients after topsoil removal as indicated by higher numbers of plant
   species and higher Shannon diversity. Furthermore, topsoil removal
   strongly promoted the re-establishment of plant species of the target
   plant community. Synthesis and applications. Overall, our study
   demonstrates how a massive intervention by topsoil removal proved
   successful in converting intensively managed into species-rich
   grasslands. This contrasts with the mild intervention of repeated mowing
   and removing of the harvested plant material. We show that, in the long
   run, potential negative effects of topsoil removal on the soil fauna can
   be successfully overcome and plant communities can develop into targeted
   species-rich grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Marginal agricultural land, which in the UK refers to upland grazings in
   particular, is going to see changes in management driven by markets,
   subsidies, grants and environmental change with implications for
   biodiversity. Using a large-scale, long-term grazing experiment in the
   UK uplands we assessed the impact of intensification (tripling sheep
   numbers), abandonment (removal of sheep) and grazer diversification
   (partial replacement of sheep by cattle) on vegetation composition in a
   heterogenous area of grassland. Species benefiting from increased
   grazing included sweet vernal grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), mat grass
   (Nardus stricta) and deer grass (Trichophorum cespitosum). Species that
   benefitted from the removal of grazing included bog asphodel (Narthecium
   ossifragum), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and blaeberry (Vaccinium
   myrtillus). Responses differed between vegetation communities; more
   productive acid grassland communities showed little change when grazing
   was removed, whilst less productive mire communities contained species,
   capable of increasing after grazing removal. Increased grazing and, to a
   lesser extent, the introduction of cattle increased species diversity.
   Synthesis and applications. Marginal agricultural grassland will likely
   see management change driven by markets, subsidies and environmental
   change. Vegetation change in these relatively infertile grasslands is
   slow and features shuffling dominance amongst species in the initial
   vegetation. Initial structural changes affect other trophic levels in
   this experiment; the slow change in composition will affect the system
   over longer timescales. Management decisions in the uplands encompass
   complex trade-offs between production, biodiversity and a range of
   ecosystem services. Predicting the consequences of decisions is
   difficult given the slow dynamics of unproductive habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Grasslands have been pivotal in the development of herbivore
   breeding since the Neolithic and still represent the most widespread
   agricultural land use across Europe. However, it remains unclear whether
   the current large-scale genetic variation of plant species found in
   natural grasslands of Europe is the result of human activities or
   natural processes. Location Europe. Taxon Lolium perenne L. (perennial
   ryegrass). Methods We reconstructed the phylogeographic history of L.
   perenne, a dominant grassland species, using 481 natural populations,
   including 11 populations of closely related taxa. We combined
   Genotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) and pool-Sequencing (pool-Seq) to obtain
   high-quality allele frequency calls of 500 k SNP loci. We performed
   genetic structure analyses and demographic reconstructions based on the
   site frequency spectrum (SFS). We additionally used the same genotyping
   protocol to assess the genomic diversity of a set of 32 cultivars
   representative of the L. perenne cultivars widely used for forage
   purposes. Results Expansion across Europe took place during the Wurm
   glaciation (12-110 kya), a cooling period that decreased the dominance
   of trees in favour of grasses. Splits and admixtures in L. perenne fit
   historical climate changes in the Mediterranean basin. The development
   of agriculture in Europe (7-3.5 kya), that caused an increase in the
   abundance of grasslands, did not have an effect on the demographic
   patterns of L. perenne. We found that most modern cultivars are closely
   related to natural diversity from north-western Europe. Thus, modern
   cultivars do not represent the wide genetic variation found in natural
   populations. Main conclusions Demographic events in L. perenne can be
   explained by the changing climatic conditions during the Pleistocene.
   Natural populations maintain a wide genomic variability at continental
   scale that has been minimally exploited by recent breeding activities.
   This variability constitutes valuable standing genetic variation for
   future adaptation of grasslands to climate change, safeguarding the
   agricultural services they provide.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Intensification of land use strongly impacts plant communities by
   causing shifts in taxonomic and functional composition. Mechanisms of
   land use-induced biodiversity losses have been described for temperate
   grasslands, but a quantitative assessment of species-specific occurrence
   optima and maximum tolerance (niche breadth) to land-use intensity (LUI)
   in Central European grasslands is still lacking. Location Temperate,
   managed permanent grasslands in three regions of Germany. Methods We
   combined extensive field work with a null model-randomization approach,
   defined a ``habitat niche{''} for each plant species based on occurrence
   and abundance across 150 grassland sites differing in LUI (i.e., amount
   of fertilizer, mowing/grazing intensity and a compound index of these),
   and assessed their realized niche breadth (tolerance). Underlying
   mechanisms driving species' responses to LUI were assessed by relating
   plant functional traits, Ellenberg indicator values (EIV), Grime's
   ecological strategies (CSR) and Briemle utilization numbers. Results Out
   of 151 plant species, 34\% responded negatively, whereas 10\% responded
   positively to high LUI. This pattern was mainly driven by species'
   response to fertilization and mowing frequency; grazing intensity
   response was less pronounced. Positively reacting species, displaying
   broader niches, were associated with competition-related functional
   traits, high EIV for nutrient supply and moisture and high mowing
   tolerance under spatiotemporally variable conditions. Negatively
   responding species, displaying relatively narrow niches confined to
   spatiotemporally homogeneous low LUI sites, were associated with a
   nutrient-retentive strategy, under nutrient-poor, base-rich soil
   conditions. Conclusion Our analyses of individual species' reactions
   clearly demonstrate that species responding negatively to high LUI
   display little tolerance towards intensive fertilization and mowing,
   leading to plant diversity loss; whereas grazing partly thwarts these
   effects by creating new habitat niches and promoting ruderal species.
   Our approach can be applied to other habitat types and biogeographical
   regions in order to quantify local specific response or tolerance,
   adding to existing knowledge about local vegetation dynamics.}},

Title = {{Suitable exclosure duration for the restoration of degraded alpine

Journal = {{LAND USE POLICY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{86}},

Abstract = {{Exclosures erected to prevent grazing have been widely adopted as a
   measure for the recovery of degraded grasslands. Many studies have
   explored the effects of exclosure use on vegetation and soil; these
   studies, however, were carried out over relatively short-time periods.
   Given the length of time required for a grassland to fully develop,
   short-term studies result in a limited understanding of exclosure
   effectiveness. To address this challenge, this study will use 5-, 13-,
   22-, and 39-year exclosure times in an alpine grassland on the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China, to evaluate the influence of exclosure
   time on species number, aboveground biomass, including both living and
   dead biomass (i.e. standing dead biomass and litter), and soil water
   content. To explore the differences between traditional grazing activity
   and exclosures, seasonal grazing served as a control measure. The
   results show that species richness was at its lowest after a 39-year
   exclosure period while the most dominant species remained invariant for
   both seasonally-grazed and exclosed plots. The greatest increase in
   living biomass occurred after a 13-year exclosure time; in contrast, the
   greatest increase in dead biomass occurred after a 39 year exclosure
   time. Furthermore, the aboveground biomass did not vary with exclosure
   time. In terms of soil depths ranging from 0-0.30 m, there was little
   difference in soil water content between seasonally-grazed and exclosed
   plots. While the soil water content recorded at the 0-0.15m layer
   fluctuated somewhat. At the 0.15-0.30 m layer it presented a consistent
   decreasing trend as exclosure time increased. A 13-year exclosure period
   proved to be a suitable duration for alpine grassland recovery since, at
   this stage, living biomass, species richness and soil water content were
   greater than that of seasonally-grazed grasslands.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{175}},

Abstract = {{Pastures in the Appalachian region of the United States comprise a mix
   of grasses, legumes and forbs that tend to differ in productivity within
   and among years. A high degree of spatial variability in hill-land
   pasture creates microsite conditions that influence botanical
   composition of pasture. The variation in sward composition presents
   logistical challenges to livestock producers who rely on a dependable
   supply of herbage mass and nutritive value to meet production goals. Our
   objective was to determine if forage communities sown for specific
   functions, for example, superior dry matter productivity, resource patch
   exploitation or targeted seasonal production, adapted to changing
   growing conditions within and among years. Productivity of communities
   differed among years reflecting the cumulative influences of time,
   ontogenetic and environmental variations. Maximum productivity was
   influenced by the specific forage community and less so by simple
   clipping and fertiliser management. Naturalised swards clipped to
   emulate hay management tended to have sustained herbage productivity but
   lower nutritive value when compared to sown communities. Rankings of dry
   matter productivity of communities were similar for each year where
   bioactive composition, high productivity and warm season tended to
   produce the most, and stoloniferous-rhizomatous and naturalised pasture
   the least. Regardless of initial sward composition, effective number of
   species as an index of diversity increased when frequently clipped
   swards were not fertilised, and when infrequently clipped swards were
   fertilised. Dry matter production patterns were not influenced by the
   effective number of species in any forage community suggesting that key
   species sustained productivity with volunteer species making lesser
   contribution to total productivity. The species composition of forage
   plant communities appears to be more important than clipping or
   fertiliser management practices as a means to sustain forage
   productivity.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN FORESTRY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{82}},

Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{Multiple-species (floristically diverse) plantings of trees and shrubs
   in former agricultural landscapes to offset (sequester) emissions of
   carbon dioxide are a recent component of Australian landscapes. Although
   their potential to mitigate biodiversity loss is recognised, this
   ecological function has not been investigated, in particular with
   respect to insect diversity. Over two summers, we used light trapping to
   sample Lepidoptera (moths) and Coleoptera (beetles) in multiple-species
   plantings in two distinct locations in Victoria (plantings of four ages
   per location) as well as in nearby remnant forest and in pasture. At
   both locations, we found that plantings had a greater abundance of
   Lepidoptera than remnants but that the abundance in plantings was
   comparable to the abundance in pasture. The species richness of
   Lepidoptera in plantings did not differ significantly from that in
   remnants but was significantly greater than that in pasture. The
   abundance and species richness of Coleoptera in plantings was lower than
   in remnant forests but higher than in pasture. The community composition
   of Lepidoptera and Coleoptera in plantings was intermediate between that
   of remnant forest and pasture, i.e. possibly transitional between the
   two vegetation types. Dissimilarity between all vegetation types was
   nevertheless high, reflecting that the abundance of individual taxa
   reflects the influence of temporally and spatially dependent factors,
   e.g. host plant size and suitability. Greater abundances of
   grass-feeding Lepidoptera in plantings explained much of the
   dissimilarity between plantings and remnant forests. Proximity to
   remnant forest was an important determinant of the community composition
   of Lepidoptera but not of Coleoptera. Moth forewing length (relevant to
   vagility which is an indicator of dispersal capacity) appeared less
   important to proximity relationships than larval host plant specificity,
   i.e. whether grass or dicot-feeding. The location of sequestration
   plantings relative to remnant forest as well as their composition
   (including the persistence of pasture grasses) will determine the
   attractiveness of the resources provided to insect herbivores and hence
   the rate at which they are colonised. Plantings near remnant native
   forest benefit insect diversity but adoption of novel silvicultural
   practices could hasten the rate at which they become functional mimics
   of native forests and support more comparable communities of insect.
   Potential trade-offs between increased establishment costs and more
   complex carbon accounting might need to be investigated to cost
   biodiversity credits associated with dual accreditation schemes.}},

Title = {{The impact of plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae) on alpine grassland
   vegetation and soil is not uniform within the home range of pika
   families}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY \& DIVERSITY}},
Abstract = {{Background: Plateau pika (Ochotona curzoniae) is a small lagomorph
   mammal, common in alpine meadows. Previous studies show that pika
   activity is not uniform within a home range of a pika family. However,
   whether such small-scale differences in pika activities induce spatial
   patterns of soil and vegetation parameters is unclear. Aims: Our aim was
   to examine if the impact of pikas on the vegetation and soil was uniform
   within a pika family's home range. Methods: Vegetation and soil were
   sampled in eight individual pika family's home ranges and control areas.
   We divided each pika home range into three areas that differed in pika
   activity, the highest activity being in the central of the home range,
   declining further away from the central. Results: Vegetation cover,
   vegetation height, above-ground biomass the abundance of graminoids,
   root biomass, soil moisture, NO3-N, soil organic carbon, the soil
   pH,soil bulk density and NH4-N showed a clear pattern that correlated
   with pika activity levels. However, other soil nutrients showed no clear
   patterns. Conclusion: Because individual pika families do notuse their
   home ranges uniformly, their spatial pattern of activity intensity
   within a home range induce a spatial patchiness in boththe vegetation
   and the soil.}},

Abstract = {{As the world's sixth mass extinction continues, the loss of large
   animals has widespread effects on biodiversity and ecosystem processes.
   Research across disparate systems, such as grasslands, marshes, forests,
   and coral reefs, shows that the effects of defaunation manifest even at
   the microbial scale, affecting microbial communities, microbe-driven
   processes, and host-microbe interactions. Microbiomes of foundation
   species, such as corals, trees, and grasses, appear especially
   vulnerable to the loss of large consumers, often resulting in disease,
   mortality, and regime shifts in ecosystems. We use the concepts of
   cascading consumer-prey interactions, as well as the bottom-up roles of
   consumers in ecosystems, to outline how future research can fill gaps in
   the field. For example, consumer diversity and body size affect the
   strength of trophic cascades and likely shape how defaunation affects
   microbiomes. Ultimately, we argue that the connections between macrobes
   and microbes are likely common but underappreciated, as the impacts of
   losing large consumers radiate throughout ecosystems.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{133-141}},

Abstract = {{Although introduced pasture grasses are essential for forage production
   in current livestock farming, some species cause serious impacts on
   native biodiversity when naturalized. Information on the seed dispersal
   of invasive forage grasses from cultivated settings to surrounding
   environments can inform management efforts to prevent their
   naturalization. In this case study, we quantified the wind-mediated seed
   dispersal distance and amount of dispersed seed of invasive forage
   grasses from agricultural grasslands in Hokkaido, northern Japan. In
   total, 200 funnel seed traps were installed around three regularly mown
   grasslands and one unmown grassland where various forage grass species
   were grown in mixture. Seeds of each species dispersed outside the
   grasslands were captured from May to October 2017. Based on the trapped
   distances of seeds, the 99th percentile dispersal distance from the
   grasslands was estimated for six species, including timothy (Phleum
   pratense L.), orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.), and Kentucky
   bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.). For two dominant species, P. pratense and
   D. glomerata, the numbers of seeds dispersed outside the field under
   mown and unmown conditions were determined under various plant cover
   situations. The estimated dispersal distances ranged from 2.3 m (P.
   pratense) to 31.5 m (P. pratensis), suggesting that areas within
   approximately 32 m of the grasslands are exposed to the invasion risk of
   some forage grass species. For both P. pratense and D. glomerata, the
   number of seeds dispersed outside the unmown grassland exceeded 100
   seeds m-2 under high plant cover situations, while the number of seeds
   dispersed from the mown grasslands at the same plant cover level was
   less than one-third of that number. The results suggest that local land
   managers focus their efforts on frequent mowing of grasslands and
   monitoring of the areas within approximately 32 m of the grasslands to
   substantially reduce the naturalization of invasive forage grasses.}},

Title = {{Recovery of bird activity and species richness in an early-stage
   tropical forest restoration}},
Journal = {{AVIAN CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Bird habitat creation is often a goal of tropical forest restoration
   because bird-driven ecosystem services can accelerate forest recovery.
   However, resident tropical bird responses are not well characterized in
   the earliest years following restoration action. During a five-year
   study of the bird community in an experimental tropical forest
   restoration, we examined temporal trends in bird activity and diversity
   and the effects of habitat variables on the distribution of bird species
   within the site. Our site consisted of 16 replicate plots with 1, 2, 4,
   or 8 native tree species planted into former heavily-grazed pasture.
   Four years after tree planting, we observed a 3-fold increase in bird
   activity and 11-fold increase in species richness compared to
   preplanting. We also found changes in proportions of habitat guilds,
   with marked declines in open country birds and increases in birds
   associated with brushy, early secondary growth, and forest edge
   habitats. Number of bird species observed differed strongly between
   plots four years postplanting. Using a multispecies occurrence model
   under a Bayesian framework, we considered possible reasons for these
   differences related to plot content and context. Content features within
   plots ({''}content{''}), including number of tree species planted,
   canopy cover, tree species identity, and presence of legacy trees, did
   not explain differences in number of bird species observed, potentially
   because of small plot size relative to bird mobility. Neighborhood
   features ({''}context{''}) of each plot did explain differences; more
   bird species were detected in plots with more adjacent woodland and
   farther from actively grazed pasture. Our results demonstrate that
   planting native tree species in highly degraded sites can generate
   rapid, positive responses from tropical bird communities. These
   responses are likely mediated by surrounding habitat matrix, which
   influences rates of bird community recovery. Considering site context
   can improve predictions of fine-scale distribution of bird activity and
   diversity within restoration sites.}},

Title = {{Larval and phenological traits predict insect community response to
   mowing regime manipulations}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{For the restoration of biodiversity in agricultural grasslands, it is
   essential to understand how management acts as an ecological filter on
   the resident species. Mowing constitutes such a filter: only species
   that possess functional traits enabling them to withstand its
   consequences can persist in the community. We investigated how the
   timing of mowing modulates this filtering effect for insects. We
   predicted that two traits drive species responses. Species with larval
   development within the meadow vegetation will suffer more from mowing
   than species whose larvae develop in or on the ground, or outside the
   meadows, while species with a later phenology should benefit from later
   mowing. We conducted a five-year experiment, replicated at 12 sites
   across the Swiss lowlands, applying three different mowing regimes to
   low-intensity hay meadows: (1) first cut of the year not earlier than 15
   June (control regime); (2) the first cut delayed until 15 July; and (3)
   leaving an uncut grass refuge on 10-20\% of the meadow area (after
   earliest first cut on 15 June). Before the first cut in years 4 or 5, we
   sampled larvae of Lepidoptera and sawflies, and adults of moths,
   parasitoid wasps, wild bees, hoverflies, ground beetles, and rove
   beetles. Overall, before the first cut of the year, abundances of
   species with vegetation-dwelling larvae were higher in meadows with
   delayed mowing or an uncut grass refuge, with some taxon-specific
   variation. In contrast, species whose larval development is independent
   of the meadow vegetation showed no differences in abundance between
   mowing regimes. Species richness did not differ among regimes. For
   species with vegetation-dwelling larvae, a fourth-corner analysis showed
   an association between early phenology and the control regime. No
   associations were found for the other functional groups. Our results
   show that slight modifications of mowing regimes, easily implementable
   in agri-environmental policy schemes, can boost invertebrate abundance,
   potentially benefitting insectivorous vertebrates.}},

Journal = {{HELIYON}},

Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands cover a large portion of the terrestrial ecosystems, and are
   vital for biodiversity conservation, environmental protection and
   livestock husbandry. However, grasslands are degraded due to
   unreasonable management worldwide, i.e., soil erosion indirectly due to
   the damage of overgrazing on vegetation coverage and soil texture. An
   in-depth investigation is necessary to quantify soil erosion in alpine
   pastures, in order to manage grasslands more sustainably. In this work,
   we collected freely available satellite images and carried out intensive
   field surveys for the whole Autonomous Province of Trento (Northeastern
   Italian Alps) in 2016. The area (and volume) of soil erosions were then
   estimated and shown in maps. The average of the depths of soil erosion
   measured in field was used as a reference for estimating soil erosion of
   the entire study area. High-resolution DEMs difference in soil surface
   conditions was also computed in two representative areas between pre-
   and post-degradation to estimate the volume and the average depth of
   eroded soils. The degradation of soil in the study areas has been
   estimated in 144063 m(2) and an estimated volume of 33610 +/- 1800 m(3).
   Results indicate that our procedure can serve as a low-cost approach for
   a rapid estimation of soil erosion in mountain areas. Mapping soil
   erosion can improve the sustainability of grazing management system and
   reduce the risk of pastureland degradation at large spatial scales.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Grazing lands should be monitored to ensure their productivity and the
   preservation of ecosystem services. The study objective was to
   investigate the effectiveness of an Ecological Health Index (EHI) for
   assessing ecosystem ecological health in grazing lands. The EHI was
   developed by synthesizing existing vegetation and soil cover indicators.
   We implemented long-term transects at 44 farms from two ecological
   regions in Patagonia, the Humid Magellan Steppe (HMS) (n = 24) and
   Subandean Grasslands (SG) (n = 20), to collect data on established
   quantifiable vegetative and soil measurements and the EHI. Using known
   quantifiable measures, the HMS had numerically greater species richness
   compared to SG. Similarly, the average percentage of total live
   vegetation was more favorable in HMS. Correlating the EHI with these
   known quantifiable measures demonstrated positive correlations with
   species richness, the percentage of total live vegetation and carrying
   capacity and was negatively correlations with bare ground. These results
   suggest that EHI could be a useful method to detect the ecological
   health and productivity in grazing lands. Overall, we conclude that EHI
   is an effective short-term monitoring approach that ranchers could
   implement annually to monitor grazing lands and determine the impacts of
   ranch decision-making on important ecosystem indicators.}},

   predicted that 1) total AMF spore abundance (TSA) and diversity would
   decrease only under intense-grazing levels and 2) AMF species spore
   abundance would depend on their life-history strategies and on the GI.
   To test our predictions, we compared AMF communities among nongrazed
   (NG), moderately grazed (MG, 0.1-0.3 sheep ha(1)), and intensely grazed
   sites (IG, > 0.3 sheep ha(1)). GI was the most important factor driving
   changes in TSA and diversity, regardless of host plant identity. TSA,
   diversity, and evenness significantly decreased in IG sites but were not
   affected by MG. AMF species spore abundance varied depending on their
   life-history strategies and Gl. Families with high growth rates like
   Glomeraceae and probably Pacisporaceae showed the highest spore
   abundance in all sites but decreased under IG. Species with higher
   carbon demands like Gigasporaceae showed low spore abundance and
   frequency in NG and MG sites and were absent in IG sites. In contrast,
   species with low growth rates, but efficient carbon usage, like
   Acaulosporaceae, showed low spore abundance in all sites but increased
   in IG sites compared with NG or MG sites. We conclude that
   intensification of grazing reduces AN' diversity and abundance, with the
   likely loss of AMF benefits for plants, such as improved nutrient and
   water uptake and soil aggregation. Therefore, sustainable grazing
   systems should be designed to improve or restore AMF communities,
   particularly in degraded rangelands. like the Patagonian steppes. (C)

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Questions The hydrophilous tall herb community is an important refuge
   for grazing-sensitive broad-leaved flowering plants. It is distributed
   throughout upland Europe but overgrazing has contributed to an
   unfavourable conservation status. To guide tall herb restoration, we
   asked: (a) Does using grazing exclusion where the tall herb habitat is
   confined to cliff ledge patches promote an expansion into the grassland
   below? (b) Does this management negatively affect vascular plant
   diversity? Location Ben Lawers NNR, Scotland. Methods Large herbivores
   have been excluded from a 180-ha area containing patches of outcrops
   rich in tall herb habitat. Using 1999 and 2017 surveys of permanent plot
   transects located in the grassland below (Before-After design), we
   quantify impacts on community composition and tall herb abundance.
   Results Species diversity remained constant although total species
   richness declined slightly and tall herb species richness increased
   significantly. There was a large expansion in tall herb cover (+29.67\%)
   and a corresponding decrease in grass cover (-26.16\%), as well as
   smaller increases in bryophytes and small herbs and a reduction in bare
   ground. Community composition shifted significantly from species typical
   of upland calcareous grassland towards those found in tall herb
   habitats. Seven tall herb species were amongst those showing the
   greatest increase in cover, along with taller grasses and understory
   herbs. Grazing tolerant grasses and low-growing, prostrate and annual
   herbs decreased. Competition for light, rather than resilience to
   herbivory, now has a major influence on the vegetation. Conclusions
   Using grazing exclusion where the tall herb habitat is largely confined
   to patches on cliff ledges facilitates an expansion into the upland
   grassland below. Although this management favours species tolerant of
   shadier conditions, there is no evidence of a negative impact on
   vascular plant community composition. It is therefore an effective
   strategy for promoting the restoration and favourable condition of this
   grazing-sensitive habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Plant invasions result in biodiversity losses and altered ecological
   functions, though quantifying loss of multiple ecosystem functions
   presents a research challenge. Plant phylogenetic diversity correlates
   with a range of ecosystem functions and can be used as a proxy for
   ecosystem multifunctionality. Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands
   are ideal systems for testing invasive species management effects
   because they support diverse biological communities, provide numerous
   ecosystem services, and are increasingly dominated by invasive
   macrophytes. Invasive cattails are among the most widespread and
   abundant of these taxa. We conducted a three-year study in two Great
   Lakes wetlands, testing the effects of a gradient of cattail removal
   intensities (mowing, harvest, complete biomass removal) within two
   vegetation zones (emergent marsh and wet meadow) on plant taxonomic and
   phylogenetic diversity. To evaluate native plant recovery potential, we
   paired this with a seed bank emergence study that quantified diversity
   metrics in each zone under experimentally manipulated hydroperiods.
   Pretreatment, we found that wetland zones had distinct plant community
   composition. Wet meadow seed banks had greater taxonomic and
   phylogenetic diversity than emergent marsh seed banks, and high-water
   treatments tended to inhibit diversity by reducing germination.
   Aboveground harvesting of cattails and their litter increased
   phylogenetic diversity and species richness in both zones, more than
   doubling richness compared to unmanipulated controls. In the wet meadow,
   harvesting shifted the community toward an early successional state,
   favoring seed bank germination from early seral species, whereas
   emergent marsh complete removal treatments shifted the community toward
   an aquatic condition, favoring floating-leaved plants. Removing cattails
   and their litter increased taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity across
   water levels, a key environmental gradient, thereby potentially
   increasing the multifunctionality of these ecosystems. Killing invasive
   wetland macrophytes but leaving their biomass in situ does not address
   their underlying mechanism of dominance and is less effective than more
   intensive treatments that also remove their litter.}},

Abstract = {{Using multiple classification approach to examine plant traits response
   to grazing and fencing (as without access to grazing) is rare. Here we
   used multiple classification approach to examine plant diversity,
   productivity and species traits response to grazing and fencing over a
   three-year period on the eastern part of the Qing-Hai Tibetan Plateau.
   The results showed that most common species response to the fence was
   poorly noticeable. The fencing meadows compared to those under long-term
   free grazing are characterized by significantly higher total species
   richness, but species richness declined with sampling years gradually,
   regardless of grazing or fencing. The correlation showed that species
   richness was negatively associated with mean annual temperature
   significantly, suggesting that abiotic factors (e.g. annual temperature)
   could also play important roles in driving species richness in this
   subalpine meadow. Total aboveground biomass was not associated with mean
   annual temperature and rainfall. The fencing meadow demonstrated higher
   community aboveground biomass relative to the grazing ones, especially
   the abundance of legume and graminoids increased, while the proportions
   of sedge decreased, suggested that grazing disturbance favours the
   increase of reproductive success of sedge (e.g. Kobresia humilis) in
   this subalpine meadow. Growth form-based analyses combined with canopy
   height categories should be recommended to reveal general rules and
   mechanisms relating to grazing.}},

Abstract = {{In the Indian sub-continent Lantana has invaded vast tracts of dry-moist
   forests and other culturable wastelands, and has potentially altered
   biodiversity, landscape ecology and ecosystem services. It has invaded
   most Indian pasture lands (13.2 million ha) besides forest and fallow
   areas, and the cost of its control is estimated at US\$ 70 per ha. This
   invasive weed stands out because of its rapid spread, intensity of
   infestation, allelopathy, opportunistic growth behaviour, reproductive
   biology traits and tenacious resistance to cutting and burning. This
   paper reviews the current knowledge on L. camara with particular focus
   on its ecological attributes such as biomass productivity, reproductive
   biology, invasiveness, allelopathy, eradication measures and economic
   uses reported from India. Based on the literature review it can be
   pointed out that the positive impacts and economic uses of Lantana
   outweigh its negative impacts and require further studies on

Abstract = {{Environmental assessment of agricultural production systems is an
   increasing concern within the international community. When evaluation
   involves biodiversity indicators, as richness or diversity in certain
   taxa or their roles in ecosystems, the participation of specialists is
   required to identify, classify and interpret diversity at the level of
   species, communities and ecosystems. Due to costs and time demand, this
   can be an important obstacle when a widespread use of these assessments
   is needed to contribute to policy making and evaluation, field
   management decision-making or implementation of a specific technology.
   We developed a new index that combines different environmental
   characteristics which can be evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively
   with a basic training, can be implemented quickly and each index
   component is directly associated with key aspects for the assessment of
   ecosystem capacity to sustain wildlife and ecosystem services. The
   Ecosystem Integrity Index (EII) evaluates the status of a specific
   ecosystem under agricultural use, referred to an optimal condition that
   must be established for the ecoregion. Its application involves a
   qualitative and quantitative visual evaluation considering four
   components: vegetation structure, plant species, soil and riparian
   areas. Each component is valued on a 0-5 scale, where 5 is the best
   possible condition. EII is a simple and robust tool for evaluating and
   monitoring integrity of agroecosystems and the primary validation
   demonstrates good correlation with other environmental variables such as
   wildlife diversity and soil organic carbon.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining semi-natural open habitats requires biomass removal, which
   can be achieved by extensive grazing with livestock species. However,
   implementing this established conservation management strategy in large
   or access-restricted areas is often not possible. We investigated
   grazing by wild and free-ranging red deer Cervus elaphus as an
   alternative conservation management approach on an active military
   training area in Germany. In grasslands and heathlands protected under
   the EU Habitats Directive, we quantified above-ground net primary
   productivity, forage quality and forage removal by red deer over three
   successive years. To assess synergistic effects between wildlife grazing
   and additional grassland management measures removing vegetation biomass
   (i.e. burning, mowing), we conducted our grazing experiment in burnt,
   mown and untreated grasslands. Annual forage removal by red deer
   amounted to 35\%, 44\%, 48\% and 59\% of the above-ground net primary
   productivity in burnt, mown and untreated grasslands, and untreated
   heathlands, respectively. Theoretically, a similar annual biomass
   removal could be obtained by livestock grazing with 0.54 animal units
   ha(-1) in grasslands and 0.45 animal units ha(-1) in heathlands. In
   grasslands, daily rates of forage removal peaked in spring and early
   summer, whereas in heathlands, forage removal rates were only
   significant in winter. Forage removal rates in grasslands increased with
   productivity and forage quality, which were both enhanced in mown
   grasslands. This suggests mowing can increase grassland attractiveness
   to red deer. Forage removal rates in heathlands did not relate to
   productivity or forage quality but to standing biomass. Synthesis and
   applications. We demonstrate that the quantity of forage removed by wild
   red deer can be comparable to that of livestock in common conservation
   grazing systems. The seasonal patterns of forage removal by red deer in
   grasslands and heathlands coincided with the different grazing
   requirements of these habitats. Especially in large areas of
   conservation interest, we therefore encourage attempts to modify current
   wildlife management strategies to allow red deer to forage in open
   landscapes, which can contribute to the conservation of semi-natural
   open habitats and also help to reduce damage in forest stands.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning (BEF) is
   a central issue in ecology. Recent empirical and theoretical studies
   have shown that ecosystem functioning is strongly affected by the
   community-weighted mean (CWM) traits and functional traits diversity
   (FTD). However, little is known about the relative roles of CWM traits
   and FTD in explaining ecosystem functioning along a grassland
   restoration gradient on the Loess Plateau of China. We set up a
   grassland restoration gradient on the Loess Plateau of China applying
   the chronosequence approach. Using community biomass and soil carbon
   stock (SCS) as proxies for ecosystem functioning, we measured 13
   functional traits on 28 common plant species and identified the dominant
   functional traits through principal component analysis (PCA). Our
   results showed that: (1) Specific leaf area (SLA), mature plant height
   (MPH) and leaf dry matter content (LDMC) loaded on separate principle
   components, which could be regarded as dominant functional traits to
   assess ecosystem functioning. (2) The variation of species diversity was
   not obvious, but FTD changed significantly along the restoration
   gradient. Following initial increases, FTD, CWM-SLA and SCS then
   declined, with the threshold occurring at the 18-year restoration. (3)
   Community biomass increased significantly through more biomass
   allocation to the below-ground in the latter stage of restoration.
   Community biomass was significantly correlated with CWM-MPH while SCS
   was positively correlated with CWM-SLA. We conclude that community-level
   functional traits are better than species diversity and FTD in
   predicting ecosystem functioning, and specifically restoration for 18
   years could be the turning point for the degraded grassland ecosystem on
   the Loess Plateau of China.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Urban wastelands are important substitute habitats for many insect
   species, but their value for the protection of wild bees is still poorly
   studied. We assessed species richness, abundance, and the diversity of
   wild bees in wastelands that differed in area (2-35ha), stage of
   ecological succession, location (suburbs or closer to the city centre),
   and history of land use. In the investigated plots, we recorded 42\% of
   all bee species reported from Poland. The attractiveness of wastelands
   was positively correlated with the coverage of blooming herbs, coverage
   of shrubs and low trees, and the area of the wasteland. An increase in
   isolation of the habitat patches, the percentage contribution of alien
   species, annuals, and low grasses (<25 cm) negatively affected the
   diversity of Apiformes. Considering the history of land use, we found
   that the bees were most attracted to wastelands resulting from
   extractive industry (sand and clay pits), and grassy habitats located in
   the suburbs, e.g. at sites grazed earlier by sheep. Wastelands in areas
   directly influenced by the chemical industry were the least attractive
   to bees. Analyses of quantitative and qualitative similarity of bees in
   various habitat types showed that three habitat types were the most
   similar to grasslands in the suburbs (the least disturbed habitats):
   degraded grasslands located closer to the city centre, extraction pits,
   and old fields. The presented results indicate that urban wastelands,
   including some post-industrial sites, can be important secondary
   habitats for wild bees. Thus, proper management of urban natural
   resources should cover both the formally managed areas and the so-called
   unproductive spaces, which have been undervalued so far.}},

Abstract = {{Orchard grasslands in Central Europe are highly valued due to their
   contribution to the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes. Little is
   known about the factors that control the phytodiversity of orchards and
   the role of small scale vegetation heterogeneity. In our study, we
   address the role of (1) tree stock, (2) soil parameters and (3) site
   management on orchard grassland heterogeneity and diversity. For this
   purpose, we investigated species diversity in 32 orchards covering a
   broad range of orchard types in Central Germany. Each study site
   comprised 9x1m(2) plots, of which three were located beneath a tree
   canopy (trunk), three in the transition zone between canopy and open
   grassland (ecotone) and three in the open grassland (open). Results show
   (1) increasing vegetation heterogeneity induced by trees. On average,
   the ecotone and open hosted significantly larger species richness than
   the trunk. They also differed from the trunk in vegetation species
   composition. (2) Increasing phosphorous content and potassium
   contents>20mg/100g showed negative effects on species richness. Species
   richness generally increased with a soil pH until about pH 6.5. (3) We
   could not prove that grazing as compared to non-grazing increased
   vegetation heterogeneity; yet, the species composition was different.
   Species composition was further affected by vegetation height, which
   also showed a negative effect on high nature value species richness. To
   preserve orchard vegetation diversity, we recommend reducing the soil
   nutritional status of enriched soils by mowing or grazing in combination
   with night penning early in the vegetation season.}},

Abstract = {{Few studies document the impacts of conservation management practices
   such as extensive grazing or mowing on the new ecosystems created by
   industrial conversions. In southern France, the Rhone channelling led to
   the construction of dykes to protect the Tricastin industrialized area
   from floods. Aiming to control plant dynamics for safety reasons and to
   favour plant biodiversity, mowing or extensive grazing by cattle were
   recently tested. Monitoring from both permanent plots and aerial
   photographs shows that three years of extensive grazing and annual
   mechanical mowing have modified plant composition, significantly
   increasing plant species richness, evenness and heterogeneity. The
   increase in evenness and beta-diversity from grazing was significantly
   higher than from mowing. Only grazing was able to reduce the height and
   cover of the dominant tussock perennial grass species (Brachypodium
   phoenicoides), while increasing bare soil cover and thus the
   contribution of annual species. The Normalized Difference Vegetation
   Index (NDVI) obtained through aerial photographic analyses confirmed the
   correlation between NDVI, aboveground biomass and plant species richness
   for the grazed site alone, allowing the results obtained from quadrats
   to be generalized to the scale of the grazed site. On the Rhone's
   artificial dykes, extensive grazing appears to be a better management
   tool than mowing to enhance plant biodiversity and meet safety
   objectives.}},

Title = {{Expert-Based Evaluation of Ecosystem Service Provision in Coastal Reed
   Wetlands Under Different Management Regimes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 31}},
Abstract = {{A characteristic feature of lagoons and estuaries along the Baltic Sea
   is the dominance of reed (Phragmites australis) along their coasts. Reed
   wetlands are ecologically valuable ecosystems and play an important role
   for nutrient and matter cycling as well as for biodiversity. They
   provide a broad spectrum of ecosystem services and have been utilized by
   humans already for centuries. We assess the ecosystem service provision
   of reed wetlands and analyze how this is affected by different
   management scenarios and how the results of an expert-based ecosystem
   service assessment can be used in practice. Because of strong internal
   gradients and interactions with the surrounding, coastal reed belts show
   a higher ecosystem service provision compared to homogeneous inland
   reed. The three different coastal management scenarios are (1) winter
   harvest of reed, (2) summer harvest of reed, and (3) grazing by
   livestock. According to the views of 18 involved experts from Lithuania,
   Poland, and Germany, winter harvest is regarded as the scenario with the
   lowest conflict potential between nature protection and reed
   utilization. Experts expect no changes or even slight increases for
   regulating and cultural services. However, experts see the need to
   establish a sustainable and regionally anchored winter harvest concept.
   Summer harvest and grazing entail the risk to change the ecosystem
   structure and could lead to a shift in vegetation pattern toward short
   salt marsh grassland. Experts expect a slight decrease in regulating
   services. In particular, erosion control, biodiversity, and nutrient
   sequestration are rated controversially. To our experience, these
   expert-based ecosystem service assessments can support policy
   implementation (e.g., NATURA 2000, European Water Framework Directive or
   Marine Strategy Framework Directive). It can serve as a tool that allows
   stakeholders to visualize trade-offs, analyze patterns and processes at
   regional scales, and hence facilitate decision-making.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: The stoichiomernic characteristics of plant communities are
   important controller for several fundamental ecological processes. The
   effects of environmental changes on community stoichiometric
   characteristics are driven by intra- and inter-specific variation.
   However, the relative importance of both pathways has seldom been
   empirically examined.
   Methods: We quantified the relative contribution of intra- and
   inter-specific variation to the changes of community nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P) concentrations after seven-year factorial N addition and
   mowing treatments in a semi-arid grassland of northern China.
   Results: Nitrogen addition significantly increased community N and P
   concentrations and N:P ratio. Mowing significantly increased community N
   concentration and N:P. Intra-specific variation contributed more than
   inter-specific variation to the total variability of all the nutritional
   and stoichiometric characteristics, with intra-specific variation
   accounting for 68\%, 70\%, and 75\% of the total variation in community
   level N, P, and N:P, respectively. Negative covariations between the
   contribution of intra- and inter specific variation occurred for
   community N and P concentrations. Further, N addition and mowing
   interacted to affect the impacts of intra- and inter-specific variation
   on community N concentration and N:P stoichiometry.
   Conclusions: Our results highlight different ways of trait selection for
   N addition and mowing treatments. Interactions between those two factors
   make it more difficult to accurately predict the responses of
   plant-mediated biogeochemical cycles under co-occurrence of
   environmental changes. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Well-managed grassland heterogeneity promotes butterfly conservation in

Abstract = {{Habitat degradation is a major concern in transformed landscapes, as it
   reduces complexity by removing species, interactions, and ultimately
   biodiversity. Degradation is also of concern for ecological networks
   (ENs) composed of an interconnected system of conservation corridors
   among South Africa's commercial forestry compartments. These corridors
   are predominantly grasslands, and used as rangeland, so managed to
   optimize grazing conditions. Yet, how this management approach
   influences biodiversity remains unknown. Here, we studied how butterfly
   assemblages respond to local differences in rangeland quality (low, high
   and reference sites), and how this effect compared to that of local
   environmental variables (e.g. rockiness and bare ground), meso
   environmental gradients (e.g. topographic position and aspect), and
   landscape composition (i.e. proportion of different land cover types in
   the surrounding matrix). We calculated species richness and composition,
   Shannon's diversity index (H'), and the Butterfly Conservation Index
   (BCIn) representing the proportion of sensitive and range-restricted
   butterfly species per site. Rangeland quality was considered less
   important for butterflies than other environmental variables, but it was
   also significantly confounded with other environmental variables. At the
   landscape scale, proportion of grassland in the landscape matrix
   influenced butterfly assemblage composition, while proportion of thicket
   had a significant positive effect on BCIn. Moreover, the effect of
   elevation on assemblage composition emphasizes the value of maintaining
   environmental gradients within these conservation corridors. At the meso
   spatial scale, butterfly species richness and diversity (H') declined
   with increased dominance by a single plant species, which usually occurs
   late in a normal fire cycle. This suggests a reliance by butterflies on
   recurring natural disturbances for long-term persistence. We recommend
   moderate patch burning and grazing, as well as occasional hot burns to
   reduce thicket in Afromontane grassland. This approach would improve
   local scale vegetation patterns, and increase heterogeneity across the
   landscape for conserving these butterflies into the future.}},

Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{440}},
Pages = {{23-30}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{During the last centuries, land use in Europe intensified, which has led
   to a drastic decrease in the cover of semi-natural grasslands. In
   Sweden, much of the lost grasslands was turned into forest. This study
   investigated if species typical of managed grasslands could be found in
   coniferous production forests more than 80 years after grassland
   management ceased. Species and trait composition for plants was
   investigated in two types of forest differing in land use history
   (meadow in the 1870s or continuous coniferous forest), and in reference
   grasslands. The average plant species richness as well as the richness
   of grassland indicator species were 30\% higher in forests with a
   history as meadow compared to in forests with a history as forest, hence
   clear signs of historical grassland management in today's forests.
   Compared with forests with continuous coniferous history, vegetation in
   forests with a meadow history tended to be more similar to reference
   grassland regarding both plant species and especially plant trait
   composition. The study provides proof of remnant grassland populations
   in coniferous production as the source for the biodiversity of
   clearcuts, rather than seed dispersal or seed bank survival. The result
   highlights the importance of land use for biodiversity of clearcuts, and
   points to the potential value of forests with a history of meadow in
   grassland conservation and restoration.}},

Journal = {{NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Number = {{34}},

Abstract = {{The genus Opetiopalpus from the family of checkered beetles (Coleoptera:
   Cleridae) is represented by 28 species worldwide, with 11 species found
   in the Palearctic and only four sparsely in Europe prior to 1998. One
   species, Opetiopalpus sabulosus Motschulsky, 1840, was recently found in
   Eastern Europe (i.e. Ukraine, Bulgaria, and Moldavia), with the most
   recent record in 2015 in Eastern Romania: no data are available for
   Central Europe. During a comprehensive sampling survey in 2016 in the
   dry inner-Alpine Vinschgau Valley (South Tyrol, Italy), one individual
   of O. sabulosus was recorded from soil core samples on an extensively
   managed steppe-like dry pasture at 2000 m a.s.l. This was the first
   record of O. sabulosus for the European Alps and Central Europe. Further
   intensive samplings were conducted in 2017 and 2018, in which one
   additional specimen at a dry pasture at 2500 m confirms the presence of
   this checkered beetle. Opetiopalpus sabulosus seems to have a cryptic
   lifestyle and therefore a low detection probability. The locations from
   where the species was recorded, all steppe-like dry grasslands that are
   part of the LTSER area ``Val Mazia/Matschertal{''} within the
   LTER-Italia network, are characterized by low precipitation (730 mm at
   2000 m a.s.l.) and traditional low input management (grazing cattle,
   sheep, and horses). Beside O. sabulosus, other rare and new species for
   South Tyrol and Italy were found at the sampling area. Therefore, our
   records underline the high biodiversity and the high nature
   conservational value of these steppe-like dry grasslands and the
   importance of long-term research to monitor such species.}},

Title = {{Examining the assumptions of heterogeneity-based management for
   promoting plant diversity in a disturbance-prone ecosystem}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAY 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Patch-burn management approaches attempt to increase overall
   landscape biodiversity by creating a mosaic of habitats using a patchy
   application of fire and grazing. We tested two assumptions of the
   patch-burn approach, namely that (1) fire and grazing drive spatial
   patch differentiation in community structure and (2) species composition
   of patches change through time in response to disturbance.
   Methods: We analyzed species cover data on 100 m(2) square quadrats from
   128 sites located on a 1 x 1 km UTM grid in the grassland habitats of
   the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve. A total of 20 of these sites were
   annually sampled for 12 years. We examined how strongly changes in
   species richness and species composition correlated with changes in
   management variables relative to independent spatial and temporal
   drivers using multiple regression and direct ordination, respectively.
   Results: Site effects, probably due to edaphic differences, explained
   the majority of variation in richness and composition. Interannual
   variation in fire and grazing management was relatively unimportant
   relative to inherent site and year drivers with respect to both richness
   and composition; however, the effects of fire and grazing variables were
   statistically significant and interpretable, and bison management was
   positively correlated with plant richness.
   Conclusions: There was some support for the two assumptions of
   patch-burn management we examined; however, in situ spatial and temporal
   environmental heterogeneity played a much larger role than management in
   shaping both plant richness and composition. Our results suggest that
   fine-tuning the application of fire and grazing may not be critical for
   maintaining landscape scale plant diversity in disturbance-prone
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Declining biodiversity (BD) is affecting food security, agricultural
   sustainability, and environmental quality. Agroforestry (AF) is
   recognized as a possible partial solution for BD conservation and
   improvement. This manuscript uses published peer-reviewed manuscripts,
   reviews, meta-analysis, and federal and state agency documents to
   evaluate relationships between AF and BD and how AF can be used to
   conserve BD. The review revealed that floral, faunal, and soil microbial
   diversity were significantly greater in AF as compared to monocropping,
   adjacent crop lands, and within crop alleys and some forests. Among the
   soil organisms, arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi (AMF), bacteria, and enzyme
   activities were significantly greater in AF than crop and livestock
   practices. Agroforestry also creates spatially concentrated high-density
   BD near trees due to favorable soil-plant-water-microclimate conditions.
   The greater BD was attributed to heterogeneous vegetation, organic
   carbon, microclimate, soil conditions, and spatial distribution of
   trees. Differences in BD between AF and other management types
   diminished with time. Evenly distributed leaves, litter, roots,
   dead/live biological material, and microclimate improve soil and
   microclimate in adjacent crop and pasture areas as the system matures.
   Results of the study prove that integration of AF can improve BD in
   agricultural lands. Selection of site suitable tree/shrub/grass-crop
   combinations can be used to help address soil nutrient deficiencies or
   environmental conditions. Future studies with standardized management
   protocols may be needed for all regions to further strengthen these
   findings and to develop AF establishment criteria for BD conservation
   and agricultural sustainability.}},

Title = {{Trade-offs and synergies in a payment-for-ecosystem services program on

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Increasingly, agriculture is recognized as valuable not only for food
   production, but also for regulating and supporting ecosystem services
   such as those encompassing biodiversity and water. Various government
   programs provide incentives to farmers and ranchers to maintain
   ecosystem services, with an emerging focus on payment-for-ecosystem
   services (PES) programs. However, interactions among ecosystem services,
   including synergies or trade-offs, at spatial scales relevant to land
   managers are not well understood. Here, we examined how a PES program
   for enhanced water retention on subtropical ranchlands in the headwaters
   of the Everglades affected seven indicators of ecosystem services and
   three indicators of disservices within wetlands (local scale) and among
   wetlands (wetland scale) at four different ranches. We used general
   linear mixed models and model selection to evaluate the feasibility of
   explicit, a priori hypotheses using data from 15 wetlands sampled across
   four participating ranches. Our study indicated that managing for
   increased water retention could result in both synergies and trade-offs
   among ecosystem services. Higher water retention increased wetland
   plants at both local and wetland scales and was associated with reduced
   mosquitoes. Trade-offs included significant declines in forage plant
   cover and decreases in amphibian abundance with higher water retention.
   Unimodal non-linear relationships described responses of
   macroinvertebrates, fish, mosquito, and non-native plant abundance to
   increasing water retention. These complex relationships indicate that
   optimizing water retention, provisioning services, and wetland
   biodiversity in ranchlands may not be straightforward. Unimodal
   non-linear relationships among water retention and biodiversity suggest
   there is a threshold of water retention that represents a trade-off for
   also maintaining biodiversity. Land use was an important driver of
   ecosystem disservices, with more intensely managed ranches having a
   greater potential for ecosystem disservices such as increased cover of
   non-native plants, abundant mosquitoes, and lower amphibian abundance.
   Multidisciplinary collaboration was required to design, implement,
   monitor, and assess this PES program for trade-offs and synergies.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivory is one of the most important antagonistic insect-plant

   indirectly increase herbivory (i.e., releasing herbivores from top-down
   control). At a local scale, reduced plant diversity may enhance
   herbivory through lessened associated resistance, while resource
   availability (i.e., higher vegetation height and cover) may promote
   herbivory. Few studies have simultaneously considered the influence of
   local and landscape variables on insect herbivory. We evaluate effects
   of landscape (fragment size, connectivity, and arable land percentage)
   and local factors (plant cover and height and plant species richness) on
   insect herbivory in fragmented calcareous grasslands. Further, we ask
   whether these effects depend on feeding traits of herbivores (chewers
   vs. suckers) and habitat specialization of plants (specialists vs.
   generalists). Results show that herbivory was best explained by models
   including variables at both local and landscape scales. However, local
   factors were more important than landscape variables. Herbivory was in
   all cases positively related to height of herbs (i.e., taller and more
   heterogeneous food resources), whereas the effect of plant species
   richness varied with feeding traits of herbivores. Herbivory by chewers,
   which are commonly more generalist feeders, was negatively affected by
   plant species richness, supporting the idea of associated plant
   resistance. In contrast, herbivory by suckers, which tend to be more
   specialized, increased with plant richness. Although there was little
   influence of landscape scale, herbivory on specialist plants was
   significantly higher in smaller grasslands probably as a consequence of
   herbivore release from natural enemies. Functional redundancy among
   herbivore species would allow to maintain overall herbivory in
   fragmented calcareous grasslands. This study highlights the need to
   consider different herbivore and plant traits for a better understanding
   of herbivory responses to local and landscape factors.}},

Abstract = {{ContextGlobal change pressures (GCPs) imperil species and associated
   ecosystem functions, but studies investigating interactions of
   landscape-scale pressures remain scarce. Loss of species-rich habitat
   and agricultural expansion are major threats for biodiversity, but if or
   how these factors interactively determine community-level shifts and
   conservation outcomes remains unclear.ObjectivesWe tested whether matrix
   simplification (dominance of cropland) and reduced connectivity (i.e.
   landscape-scale habitat loss) either additively, synergistically or
   antagonistically cause community shifts in butterflies, a group of high
   conservation relevance.MethodsWe surveyed butterflies on 30 small
   calcareous grassland fragments (<1ha) in Central Germany, representing
   independent gradients in grassland connectivity (an index combining
   grassland area and proximity), and matrix quality (landscape proportion
   of cropland). Using proportional odds logistic regression, we assessed
   whether connectivity and matrix quality interactively altered the
   distribution of Red List statuses, and assessed effects of local scale
   management (mowing, grazing, short-term abandonment).ResultsWe found
   synergistic, conservation relevant effects: Connectivity boosted the
   proportion of red-listed species from 20 to 52\% in crop land poor
   landscapes, but not in crop land rich landscapes, particularly driven by
   endangered and critically endangered species. Grazed sites had the
   lowest species richness, abundance, and proportions of conservation
   relevant butterflies.ImplicationsMitigation measures targeting one
   landscape-scale pressure only may be inefficient, particularly for
   red-listed species. Increasing habitat connectivity bolsters butterfly
   communities and potential pollination services, but only if accompanied
   by measures to soften the matrix. Hence, halting biodiversity losses
   needs better understanding and implementation of complex conservation
   measures at the landscape scale.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to assess and highlight the significance of
   cultural landscapes in protected areas, considering both biodiversity
   and the delivery of provisioning ecosystem services. In order to do
   that, we analyzed 26 protected areas in Andalusia (Spain), all of them
   Natural or National Parks, regarding some of their ecosystem services
   (agriculture, livestock grazing, microclimate regulation, environmental
   education and tourism) and diversity of the four terrestrial vertebrate
   classes: amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. A cluster analysis
   was also run in order to group the 26 protected areas according to their
   dominant landscape. The results show that protected areas dominated by
   dehesa (a heterogeneous system containing different states of ecological
   maturity), or having strong presence of olive groves, present a larger
   area of delivery of provisioning ecosystem services, on average. These
   cultural landscapes play an essential role not only for biodiversity
   conservation but also as providers of provisioning ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding of the interaction of livestock grazing and rainfall
   variability may aid in predicting the patterns of herbaceous species
   diversity and biomass production. We manipulated the amount of ambient
   rainfall received in grazed and ungrazed savanna in Lambwe Valley-Kenya.
   The combined influence of livestock grazing and rainfall on soil
   moisture, herbaceous species diversity, and aboveground biomass patterns
   was assessed. We used the number of species (S), Margalef's richness
   index (D-mg), Shannon index of diversity (H), and Pileou's index of
   evenness (J) to analyze the herbaceous community structure. S, D-mg, H
   and J were higher under grazing whereas volumetric soil water contents
   (VWC) and aboveground biomass (AGB) decreased with grazing. Decreasing
   (50\%) or increasing (150\%) the ambient rainfall by 50\% lowered
   species richness and diversity. Seasonality in rainfall influenced the
   variation in VWC, S, Dmg, H, and AGB but not J (p=0.43). Overall, D-mg
   declined with increasing VWC. However, the AGB and D-mg mediated the
   response of H and J to the changes in VWC. The highest H occurred at AGB
   range of 400-800 gm(-2). We attribute the lower diversity in the
   ungrazed plots to the dominance (relative abundance>70\%) of Hyparrhenia
   fillipendulla (Hochst) Stapf. and Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. Grazing
   exclusion, which controls AGB, hindered the coexistence among species
   due to the competitive advantage in resource utilization by the more
   dominant species. Our findings highlight the implication of livestock
   grazing and rainfall variability in maintaining higher diversity and
   aboveground biomass production in the herbaceous layer community for
   sustainable ecosystem management.}},

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{697-706}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Soil nematodes are ubiquitous in terrestrial ecosystems. Nematodes are
   one of the most abundant groups of soil invertebrates, and they
   influence ecosystem processes and functions. Plant litter is a
   fundamental factor in controlling the structure of belowground
   communities. The addition of nitrogen (N) can restructure soil nematode
   communities by affecting the quantity and quality of litter input into
   soil. However, little is known about how N and litter interact to affect
   nematode communities. We examined the response of soil nematodes to the
   addition of N and litter manipulation (i.e. initial litter, removal,
   addition) in a 6-year field experiment in grassland, and quantified the
   effects of additions of N and litter on nematode abundance, diversity
   and community structure through the plant community and nutrients in
   soil. There were interactive effects between additions of N and litter
   on nematode numbers and trophic group abundance, the Shannon-Wiener
   index (H `) and the maturity index. The addition of litter without that
   of N increased the total and trophic group abundance, whereas the
   addition of N and litter decreased nematode H ` and the maturity index.
   Structural equation modelling (SEM) revealed that the addition of N
   decreased herbivore abundance through increasing plant N concentration,
   and directly decreased fungivore abundance and indirectly decreased
   bacterivore and omnivore predator abundance through fungivores. The
   positive effects of litter addition on nematodes without the addition of
   N and its negative effects on treatments with the addition of N
   suggested that without added N, increased litter accumulation could
   benefit the soil nematode community. However, under scenarios of N
   deposition, grassland management that reduced litter accumulation, such
   as grazing and mowing, could also benefit soil nematode communities.
   Highlights
   There were interactive effects between additions of N and litter on
   nematode community N addition decreased nematode abundance and diversity
   in litter addition treatments Without N addition, litter addition
   increased nematode abundance and diversity Nematodes were affected
   mainly through decreased fungivore abundance}},

Abstract = {{In Matsalu National Park a flood is a natural disturbance which shapes
   ecosystems and communities. The impact of human activities (e.g.
   extensive mowing once a year or low stress grazing) on the habitat in
   this area is low. The disturbances are caused by natural conditions such
   as melting snow, precipitation and brackish sea water and the presence
   of flood is supported by flat relief. The aim of the current study was
   to describe the Chilopoda and Diplopoda assemblages of semi natural
   meadows and to find out the effect of habitat conditions on these
   invertebrates. On the 12 studied meadows we sampled and analysed soil
   invertebrates by using pitfall traps in the non-flooded and flooded
   areas of meadows. The individuals of 10 Chilopoda species and 15
   Diplopoda species, which assemblages were more abundant and diverse in
   the non-flooded areas of meadows with trees and bushes nearby, were
   collected on semi natural meadows in Matsalu. Only a few species were
   represented in abundance on studied meadows including Leptoiulus
   proximus, L. cibdellus, Julus terrestris, J. scanicus. The species
   Pachymerium ferrugineum, Schendyla nemorensis, Julus terrestris, J.
   scanicus, Leptoiulus cibdellus, Xestoiulus laeticollis were also found
   in the areas flooded with brackish water. The activity density and
   species richness of Chilopoda and Diplopoda were significantly lower in
   the flooded areas of the meadow after flood water withdrawal compared to
   the non-flooded areas of the same meadows.}},

Abstract = {{The anthropogenic impact on natural environments and the loss of species
   diversity along with changes in functional diversity call for effective
   steps to ensure habitat conservation. The functional diversity in
   particular has suffered in recent decades due to investment and land use
   changes. The translocation of whole turfs of certain vegetation plots
   prior to being destroyed is one possible solution for maintaining
   habitat functional diversity. In the presented paper, we analyse the
   functional changes in adaptive, regeneration and urbanity plant traits
   for meadow, heath and fen that were translocated from a rural site to a
   post-industrial site in a city. After five years of monitoring, we
   checked the changes in the functional diversity (FD) and community
   weighted means with the adoption of nine traits and Rao's quadratic
   entropy for calculating the FD and the relative treatment effect (RTE)
   to evaluate the influence of time. We found that the overall FD of that
   trait set was not significantly changed. The FD of the seed dispersal
   type significantly increased. The means of autochoric, anemochoric and
   hemerochoric species decreased, and nautochoric and zoochoric species
   increased significantly, with respect to the frequency and abundance.
   The flowering season was shorter for meadows and heaths with earlier
   start and termination. The most important factors of the FD changes are
   probably linked to the microclimate of the urbanized area and the
   cessation of grazing. Our study demonstrated that translocation of
   vegetation plots from rural to urbanized environments can be a fairly
   effective measure in landscape shaping and in promoting biodiversity in
   urban ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Vegetation composition of Lolium perenne-dominated grasslands under
   organic and conventional farming}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{45-53}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification has caused a decline of semi-natural
   grasslands and loss of botanical diversity, making agricultural fields
   dominated by Lolium perenne the main grassland system in large areas of
   Europe. Increased insight into the factors determining their vegetation
   composition and plant species richness is needed to improve the
   effectiveness of agri-environment schemes and to substantiate the
   benefits of organic over conventional agriculture. Our aims were (1) to
   determine the difference in vegetation composition (including species
   richness) between Lolium perenne-dominated fields of conventional and
   organic farms in a case study region in The Netherlands, and (2) to
   identify the soil and management related drivers behind this difference.
   We collected vegetation, soil and management data in grasslands of dairy
   farms under conventional or organic management (45 fields in total), and
   used multivariate statistics to determine the effect of fertilisation
   rates, grazing and cutting regime, and soil properties on plant species
   composition. In a next step we determined to what extent these abiotic
   drivers differ between organic and conventional farms.
   On average the organic fields appeared to have a c. 30\% higher plant
   species richness compared to the conventional ones. Vegetation
   composition was most strongly influenced by groundwater level and
   nitrogen and phosphorus fertilisation rates, and to a lesser extent by
   plant-available soil potassium, mowing date, total soil nitrogen,
   potassium fertilisation rate, age of each field, and livestock (cow or
   sheep). In general, a low fertilisation rate, high groundwater level,
   late mowing, low level of plant-available potassium, high level of total
   soil nitrogen, old fields and the presence of sheep promote a high
   species richness. However, of these variables only nitrogen
   fertilisation rate and groundwater level differ significantly between
   the organic and conventional farms and are therefore likely to be the
   abiotic drivers of the difference in species richness and vegetation
   composition between the farm types. Of these two, the difference in
   nitrogen fertilisation rate is a direct result of a difference in
   management philosophy, but the difference in groundwater level is not.
   We hypothesize that the latter difference is caused by economic drivers,
   whereby a less productive soil is an incentive for a changeover to
   organic farming. If this is the case indeed, the application of
   agri-environment schemes would be most effective in less productive (and
   naturally more species-rich) sites. (C) 2019 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

Abstract = {{Wildflower strips (WS) are proposed in many European countries as a
   strategy to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem services in arable
   fields. To create and maintain WS on nutrient-rich cultivated soils
   reveals challenging. Flowered species may be outcompeted by grasses due
   to high phosphorus content in soil. We studied during 5 years seed
   mixture (grass density in the seed mix) and mowing regime influenced the
   ability of WS to provide environmental benefits (flower provision for
   insects and landscape purposes, reduction of soil nutrient load) and
   respond to farmer concerns (noxious weed promotion, forage production).
   Lowered grass density increased flower abundance, but not diversity,
   only in the first 3 years. In the last 2 years mowing effects became
   determinant. Flower cover and richness were the highest under the
   twice-a-year mowing regime. This regime also increased forage quantity
   and quality. Flower colour diversity was conversely the highest where
   mowing occurred every two years. Potassium in the soil decreased under
   the twice-a-year mowing regime. Other nutrients were not affected. No
   management option kept noxious weed to an acceptable level after 5
   years. This supports the need to test the efficacy of specific
   management practices such as selective clipping or spraying. Mowing WS
   twice a year was retained as the most favourable treatment to maintain
   species-rich strips with an abundant flower provision. It however
   implies to mow in late June, i.e. at the peak of insect abundance. It is
   therefore suggested to keep an unmown refuge zone when applying this
   management regime.}},

Abstract = {{The number and quality of temporary wetlands are declining worldwide and
   many of the remaining habitats are used as pastures and drinking sites
   for livestock. Livestock can impact wetlands through a combination of
   herbivory (defoliation), trampling (physical disturbance), and
   defecation (nutrient input), but how these influence community structure
   is still poorly understood. It is nonetheless generally accepted that
   wetland management can include some grazing, and that properly managed
   livestock can play a major role in wetland conservation. In
   Mediterranean temporary ponds, however, it is suggested that grazing
   might negatively affect macrophyte biodiversity within the pond basin.
   The impact of livestock on the characteristic freshwater fauna also
   remains understudied. Using an outdoor mesocosm experiment, we focused
   on two effects of sheep livestock (trampling and defecation) and their
   combination, on water quality and on faunal and floral communities from
   Moroccan temporary ponds. Communities from forested and agricultural
   sites (pond type) were also compared in a factorial design with
   treatments. We found that sheep-simulated trampling and nutrient input
   decreased hatching invertebrate and plant richness, while lasting
   effects on water quality and actively colonising communities were
   limited. Temporary pond communities from forested and agricultural sites
   differed in species composition and interacted with treatments in their
   effects on hatching crustaceans and macrophyte species composition.
   Treatments had a larger effect on the species composition of forest
   ponds compared to agricultural ponds. These results highlight the
   complex effects livestock may have on aquatic communities. Water
   quality, taxonomic groups, and trophic levels responded negatively to
   trampling and waste treatments and these responses changed with pond
   type. With worldwide declines of seasonal wetland habitat, the effects
   of land use (i.e. livestock grazing) on these ecosystems and their biota
   are important to consider for integrated and sustainable management.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in land-use and climate affect the distribution and diversity of
   plant and animal species at different spatiotemporal scales. The extent
   to which species-specific phenotypic plasticity and biotic interactions
   mediate organismal adaptation to changing environments, however, remains
   poorly understood. Woody plant expansion is threatening the extent of
   alpine grasslands worldwide, and evaluating and predicting its effects
   on herbivores is of crucial importance. Here, we explore the impact of
   shrubification on the feeding efficiency of Pyrenean chamois (Rupicapra
   p. pyrenaica), as well as on the three most abundant coexisting domestic
   ungulate species: cattle, sheep and horses. We use observational diet
   composition from May to October and model different scenarios of
   vegetation availability where shrubland and woodland proliferate at the
   expense of grassland. We then predicted if the four ungulate species
   could efficiently utilize their food landscapes with their current
   dietary specificities measuring their niche breath in each scenario. We
   observed that the wild counterpart, due to a higher trophic plasticity,
   is less disturbed by shrubification compared to livestock, which rely
   primarily on herbaceous plants and will be affected 3.6 times more. Our
   results suggest that mixed feeders, such as chamois, could benefit from
   fallow landscapes, and that mountain farmers are at a growing economic
   risk worldwide due to changing land-use practices and climate

Abstract = {{Grazing is widely regarded as a critical factor affecting the vegetation
   community structure, productivity and nutritional value of natural
   grasslands. To protect and restore degraded grasslands, fencing is
   considered as a valuable tool. However, it is not clear whether long
   term fencing of grazers can improve the condition and nutritional values
   of vegetation community and soil properties. We have compared the impact
   of long term fencing and continuous grazing on vegetation community
   structure, nutritional values and soil properties of alpine meadow of
   the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by field investigation (11-13 years) and
   indoor analysis during 2015-2017. Our results showed that long-term
   fencing clearly increased the above ground biomass and coverage of plant
   functional types. Long-term fencing improved the development of four
   plant functional types (GG, grass species group; SG, sedge species
   group; LG, leguminous species group and FG, forbs species group), but
   inhibited the growth of noxious species (NG). Long-term fencing
   significantly improved soil TN, TP, TK, AN, AP and AK in 0-10 cm soil
   layer, considerable effect on the improvement of soil TN, TP, AN, AP and
   AK in 10-20 cm soil layer and soil TP, AN, AP and AK in 20-30 cm soil
   layer were observed. However, long-term fencing significantly decreased
   biodiversity indicators i.e., Richness index, Shannon-Wiener diversity
   index and Evenness index of vegetation community. A substantial decrease
   in the density, biodiversity and nutritional values (CP, IVTD and NDF)
   of four edible plants functional types (GG, SG, LG and FG) were
   recorded. While a downward trend in the TN, AN, AP and AK of above
   ground biomass and soil were observed during 2015-2017 in alpine meadows
   due to long term grazing. The density, diversity and nutritional value
   (CP and IVTD) of long-term fencing alpine meadows showed a downward
   trend over time (2015-2017). By considering the biodiversity
   conservation and grassland livestock production, long-term fencing is
   not beneficial for the improvement of density, biodiversity and
   nutritional values of plant functional types. Thus, our study suggests
   that rotational fencing and grazing would be a good management strategy
   to restore and improve the biodiversity and nutritional values of plant
   functional types in natural grassland ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Green spaces are important refuges for biodiversity in urban areas, and
   lawns are one of the most widespread elements of urban green spaces
   globally. Chinese cities have adopted the use of lawns relatively lately
   and are currently experiencing a rapid increase in lawn area. In order
   to obtain knowledge and develop recommendations related to planning,
   design, and management of lawns in public parks, this study compared
   lawns with other three types of herbaceous vegetation in terms of plant
   and pollinator diversity and composition, using Xi'an City as a case
   study. Plants and pollinators were inventoried in 72 lawns, 12 perennial
   meadows, 15 Ophiopogon japonicas groundcovers, and eight Oxalis
   corymbosa groundcovers. Plant species diversity in lawns was positively
   associated with proportion of green space around lawns and lawn age, and
   negatively associated with frequency of use of chemical fertilizers.
   Proportion of native plant species in lawns was negatively associated
   with use frequency of chemical fertilizers and mowing frequency, and
   positively associated with irrigation frequency and lawn size.
   Pollinator species diversity is positively related to flowering plant
   species richness in all vegetation types. In order to enhance plant and
   pollinator species diversity, less mowing and chemical use on lawns are
   recommended. Future urban planning should also consider preserving and
   increasing the green area coverage within the city. Based on abundance
   and attractiveness to pollinators, several native herbaceous plant
   species have potential when creating alternative green spaces to lawns,
   but more studies are required to test their performance.}},

Title = {{Distinct grazing pressure loads generate different impacts on bacterial
   community in a long-term experiment in Pampa biome}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{167-177}},

Abstract = {{The Pampa biome is a rich and fertile area of grassland in Brazil, South
   America, which has been considered ecologically important owing to its
   enriched biodiversity. However, this landscape has undergone serious
   fragmentation, with half of its original vegetation being removed due to
   continuous agricultural activities and its widespread use for livestock
   production. The excessive cattle farming has generated a significant
   grazing load on the area, which is reflected in the diminishing soil
   microbial diversity. With an aim to study the impact of increasing
   grazing load on microbial diversity of soil of pampas, the present study
   compared the bacterial communities of grassland-controlled soils of the
   Pampa biome under different grazing pressures: high (HG), moderate (MG),
   low (LG), and a control area (CG) in a long-term experiment using
   high-throughput sequencing. The soil microbial community was not
   significantly affected by the presence or absence of bacterial taxonomic
   groups; however, significant changes were detected in each different
   grazing pasture sample. This observation was especially notable in MG
   pressure that, when compared to other grazing pressures and control
   grazing (CG), was found to be associated with an increased prevalence of
   some specific groups of microorganisms. These include those belonging to
   the following families: Nitrospirae, DA052, Syntrophobacteraceae,
   Methylocystaceae, Syntrophaceae, Mycobacteriaceae, and Koribacteraceae.
   Moreover, the grazing pressure disturbance created by MG was believed to
   enhance the diversity of a bacterial community, thereby maintaining the
   stability of soil and indicating that stressed bio-systems might be more
   stable than those not experiencing stress. Thus, the results of the
   current study imply that quantitative and qualitative changes in the
   composition of the soil bacterial community could serve as an important
   indicator of both short- and long-term changes in soil health.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a conceptual framework for analyzing the dynamics of
   tree cover transformations in the cattle pastures across the Neotropics.
   It proposes that tree cover variability across cattle pastures can be
   envisioned as a set of `syndromes of production,' among which
   transformations may be linear, non-linear, or multivalued. Our framework
   is informed by a review of the literature from which we define the
   components that make up tree cover and the socioecological drivers of
   tree cover in cattle pastures. We propose that the drivers of tree cover
   are the continuum between two economies: the peasant and the capitalist.}},

Title = {{Using Functional Trait Diversity Patterns to Disentangle the Processes
   Influencing the Recovery of Subalpine Grasslands Following Abandonment
   of Agricultural Use}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, as in much of the world, are
   increasingly degrading due to exploitation for agriculture and grazing.
   Restoring such grasslands or facilitating recolonization to create
   native late-successional communities requires an understanding of how
   communities within grasslands are structured within a secondary
   succession series. Here we studied community assembly using species
   abundance, soil nutrient levels, three functional traits (photosynthesis
   rate, seed mass, and seed germination rate) in two comparable
   chronosequences of sub-alpine grasslands in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.
   These grasslands range from ``natural grassland{''} (without human
   management), to those that have been excluded from agricultural
   exploitation for 4-13 years. We were interested in shifts in functional
   trait diversity (FD; the value and range of functional traits in a
   community) and trait dispersion represented by the differences between
   observed FD and the expectation under neutral assembly. We found that a
   number of abiotic and/or biotic filters significantly influenced the
   success of species in different successional states, leading to
   systematic shifts in plant life history strategies, from traits
   indicating high relative growth rates to traits indicating high
   competitiveness. We also found comparable community assembly processes
   between 13-year and natural grasslands, where hierarchical competition
   led to the exclusion of forb species by graminoid species and
   facilitation induced by legume species. Our results have three
   implications for degraded subalpine grasslands caused by agriculture
   exploitation in Qinghai Tibetan plateau. First, in the course of the
   abandonment of agricultural use and the return from degraded to natural
   grasslands, deterministic processes induced a shift in plant strategies
   from rapid relative growth rate under low N competition to slow relative
   growth rate under high N competition. Second, active seeding of
   graminoid and legume species may reduce the hierarchical competition,
   which in turn speedup recovery from agriculture exploitation. Finally,
   due to the close connection of functional attributes (e. g., growth,
   colonization, recruitment, and resource competition) and community
   structure, monitoring FD and trait dispersion patterns may be a good way
   to evaluate the restoration efforts in degraded grasslands caused by
   agriculture exploitation in Qinghai Tibetan plateau.}},

Abstract = {{Functional-structural plant models are increasingly being used to
   analyse relationships between plant functioning and the topological and
   spatial organisation of their modular structure. In this study, the
   performance of an individual-based model accounting for the the
   architecture and population dynamics of forage legumes in multi-species
   grasslands was assessed. Morphogenetic shoot and root parameters were
   calibrated for seven widely used species. Other model parameters
   concerning C and N metabolism were obtained from the literature. The
   model was evaluated using a series of independent experiments combining
   the seven species in binary mixtures that were subject to regular
   defoliation. For all the species, the model could accurately simulate
   phytomer demography, leaf area dynamics, and root growth under
   conditions of weak competition. In addition, the plastic changes induced
   by competition for light and N in terms of plant development, leaf area,
   N uptake, and total plant biomass were correctly predicted. The
   different species displayed contrasting sensitivities to defoliation,
   and the model was able to predict the superior ability of creeping
   species to sustain regular defoliation. As a result of competition and
   management, the balance between species changed over time and was
   strongly dependent on the pair of species used. The model proved able to
   capture these differences in community dynamics. Overall, the results
   demonstrate that integrating the individual components of population
   dynamics in a process-based model can provide good predictive capacity
   regarding mixtures of cultivated species.}},

Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Domestic livestock grazing is one of the dominant forms of land use
   globally. However, there are variable findings concerning the impacts of
   different grazing regimes on soil condition. We quantified the impacts
   of contrasting livestock grazing regimes on soil properties within
   nationally endangered temperate box-gum woodlands in south-eastern
   Australia. We sampled total soil nitrogen, phosphorus, carbon and bulk
   density at 65 woodland sites with a history of either continuous,
   strategic or rotational livestock grazing, as well as livestock grazing
   exclusion. We evaluated the influence of both historical and current
   management practices upon soil properties in the context of broad-scale
   soil forming factors such as climate, geology and topography.
   We found evidence of a strong relationship between total soil phosphorus
   and nitrogen, while phosphorus also was influenced by site-scale native
   tree cover. Total soil phosphorus and nitrogen were related to the
   combined effects of pasture type and long-term fertilizer history (> 10
   years prior to sampling). No significant differences in soil nutrients
   or bulk density were detected between different grazing treatments,
   likely due to the importance of total grazing pressure (i.e. from all
   exotic and native herbivores) and the level of environmental variation
   between sites. However, total soil phosphorus was significantly higher
   in soils sampled in the season following a grazing event, irrespective
   of grazing intensity or duration. Total soil nitrogen and carbon
   exhibited a similar pattern. This is likely a result of multiple
   processes such as direct input of organic matter to the soil and
   stimulation of soil microbial communities. These findings have important
   implications for the strategic management of woodland understorcy
   vegetation as soil nutrients have been identified as important drivers
   of native plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Seeding legumes into degraded grasslands may effectively replace
   nitrogen fertilization and restore ecosystem stability by retaining or
   increasing native plant species diversity while increasing forage
   production. However, previous research indicated limited legume
   persistence and potential plant community diversity loss following
   seeding of legumes into grasslands, constraining successful restoration
   of degraded grasslands. Our research defined optimal management
   thresholds for successful legume establishment, reconciling both
   environmental conservation and production priorities. Large areas of
   degraded steppe in Inner Mongolia, northeast China, were seeded to
   either native alfalfa (yellow-flowered alfalfa: Medicago falcata L.),
   cultivated alfalfa (purple-flowered alfalfa: Medicago sativa L.), or
   left nonseeded (control). Within each seeded area, management treatments
   (P fertilization or mowing) were assigned to plots in the second year of
   alfalfa establishment. Our results indicated P amendments and mowing
   improve native alfalfa establishment, increasing plant productivity
   while maintaining diverse plant communities, thereby successfully
   rehabilitating degraded meadow steppe grasslands. However, cultivated
   alfalfa was not persistent under any management treatment. Alfalfa shoot
   N and P concentration was linearly related to plant-available P,
   indicating P fertilization differentially benefits alfalfa compared with
   the dominate C-3 grass, Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel. Mowing
   successfully increased plant species diversity and plant species
   asynchrony; however, mowing did not alter the temporal stability of
   plant community productivity, potentially maintaining or enhancing
   ecosystem stability. Our research showed promise that native alfalfa
   seeding combined with P fertilization and mowing can restore degraded
   grasslands to support both forage production and diverse plant
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Grazing is a major factor that affects grassland composition
   and species richness. While the long-term effects of grazing are well
   documented, information about the short-term effects of grazing is
   necessary for adaptive conservation management. Aims: Our objective was
   to ascertain how this held over varying time periods after herbivore
   removal vs. exclosures of different ages for grassland and soil seed
   bank composition in the Argentine Pampas. Methods: The composition of
   the vegetation and the seed bank assessed in plots with 2 and 12 years
   of grazing exclusion and in nearby grazed areas. Multivariate analyses
   were used to evaluate treatment effects. Results: Grazing increased bare
   ground and reduced plant cover. Grazing reduced grass specific richness
   in the seed bank, while increased the richness and density of shrubs.
   The composition of the vegetation and the seed bank was not related.
   There was a trend whereby grazed areas were characterised by shrub
   species and non-palatable or annual grasses; the 2-year-old exclosures
   by forb species and the 12-year-old exclosures were dominated by
   perennial grasses. Conclusions: The removal of herbivores has changed
   vegetation and seed bank composition. The observed trend in reduction of
   species and life form diversity may be countered by controlled grazing
   for conservation purposes.}},

Title = {{A global database on non-volant small mammal composition in natural and

Journal = {{DATA IN BRIEF}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{23}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Non-volant small mammals, which include small-bodied representatives
   from several mammal orders, have been used as a model group to test the
   effects of habitat conversion and edge creation on biodiversity. Small
   mammals occupy a large variety of habitat types and vegetation strata,
   and have varied lifestyles and diets. They include species with slow-to
   fast-life history (the Etruscan shrew Suncus etruscus and European Hare
   Lepus europaeus, respectively) and with very specialized to very
   generalist habits and diets (the Atlantic bamboo rat Kannabateomys
   amblyonyx and house mouse Mus musculus, respectively). There are no
   databases with global coverage focusing on small mammal composition in
   natural and human-modified habitats and that include neglected natural
   habitats (e.g. grasslands and savannas). Here, peer-reviewed articles
   were searched in the primary literature to synthesize almost half
   century (1973-017) of research on small mammal composition in natural
   forests, grasslands and their natural edges, and in five types of
   human-modified habitats (human-induced forest edges, human-induced
   grassland edges, crop fields, clear-cuts and tree plantations). The
   complete database includes information from 199 peer-reviewed articles.
   Presence data were obtained for 534 species (including 30 unidentified)
   in 551 sites distributed in 45 countries, 92 ecoregions, 10 biomes and
   six realms. Measurements of sampling effort and number of species
   records (number of individuals, captures) per habitat were also
   obtained, from which researchers can calculate a measure of abundance
   standardized by the sampling effort. The database will be useful for
   researchers interested in local-to broad-scale patterns of alpha- and
   beta-diversity in natural and human-modified habitats. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {{This study investigated the community structure of ciliates in Gahai
   Alpine Wetland of Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. We hypothesized that
   the ciliate community in the Plateau is more complex and the species
   diversity is richer than those in other climate zones of China. In
   particular, we studied how the ciliate species responded to
   environmental temperature, soil moisture content and the manner of
   pasture utilization. We determined key features of the ciliate
   communities such as trophic functional groups, ciliate seasonal
   distribution, species diversity and similarity index at six sample sites
   from January 2015 to October 2016. To count and characterize ciliates,
   we combined the non-flooded Petri dish method with in vivo observation
   and silver staining. We identified 162 ciliate species in this area,
   showing a high species and functional diversity. The mode of nutrition
   was diverse, with the lowest number of ciliates in group N (Nonselective
   omnivores, 4 species) and the highest number in group B
   (Bacterivores-detritivores, 118 species, corresponding to 73\% of the
   total species number). Ciliate species richness was significantly
   positively correlated with environmental temperature and moisture and
   adversely related to the intensity of agricultural land use. Rotational
   grazing by livestock or suspended grazing might be useful for
   maintaining good soil quality, thereby favoring ciliate diversity. Our
   study may serve as a reference to evaluate the ecosystem status of the
   Gahai Alpine Wetland and other similar areas in future studies.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Aims High mountain pastures are hotspots of biodiversity, but grazing
   cessation and climate change are causing tall-grass encroachment and
   expansion of scrublands and forests. As part of biodiversity
   conservation efforts, grassland variation needs to be investigated at
   different spatial scales. We aimed to assess the landscape mosaic
   variation that occurred between 1988 and 2015 in the higher
   Mediterranean mountains. We investigated the recovery or
   land-degradation processes related to land use change, the effects of
   site condition, the impacts on grassland mosaic heterogeneity, and the
   threats to biodiversity. Location Sibillini Mountains (central Italy),
   over 1,650 m a.s.l. Methods We used two-step object-based supervised
   classification on Landsat 5 and 8 satellite images to analyze changes in
   landscape patterns and vegetation cover on formerly low-intensity
   pastures, by assessing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   variation between 1988 and 2015. Twenty percent of the polygons obtained
   from segmentation were visually interpreted and assigned to five land
   cover classes. We generated a land use transition matrix and used
   Fourier Transforms to detect trends in variation of landscape mosaics
   and fragmentation. Results We observed prominent dynamics of the
   grassland mosaic leading to the homogenization of its structure through
   decreasing patch heterogeneity, especially on south-facing slopes.
   Grasslands shifted from open communities to dense pastures, with a
   reduction of scree and spread of tall grasses. The former trend could be
   understood as a recovery process reverting screes to conditions in
   equilibrium with local landform and climatic features, while the
   invasion of tall grasses is a land-degradation process that might lead
   to local species extinction and loss of habitat connectivity.
   Conclusions Pronounced changes in the large-scale landscape
   characteristics, mainly due to land use changes, of which scientists and
   managers of protected areas are not fully aware, are underway in the top
   mountain sectors of the study area.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Questions Can cattle grazing help maintain plant diversity in coastal
   grasslands? What is the relationship between soil extractable nitrogen
   and plant diversity in sandy and infertile soils? How does cattle
   grazing affect soil extractable nitrogen and how might this indirectly
   impact plant diversity via the N-plant diversity relationship? Location
   Grazed coastal grasslands on Naushon Island, off of Cape Cod, MA, USA.
   Methods We surveyed summer vegetation from 2014 to 2017 and analyzed
   soils for extractable nitrogen (N) in two grazed grasslands on Naushon
   Island. We also set up cattle enclosures and exclosures to manipulate
   grazing pressure and test how cattle grazing influenced plant diversity
   (species richness and Shannon's diversity) and extractable NH4+ and
   NO3-. In the enclosure experiment, cattle were enclosed for up to a week
   in the mid-summer of 2014, 2015, and 2016. For the exclosure experiment,
   we excluded cattle from areas from 2014 to 2017. Results In both the
   enclosure and exclosure experiments, higher grazing pressure
   corresponded to less negative change of plant species richness and
   Shannon's diversity from 2014 to 2017. Total extractable N had a weak
   positive correlation with plant diversity, but increasing extractable
   NO3- correlated with decreasing species richness (p = 0.001) and
   Shannon's diversity (p = 0.009). Neither the cattle enclosures nor
   exclosures were related to soil extractable N. Conclusions Cattle
   grazing may help prevent or slow losses of plant diversity that are
   occurring in many coastal grasslands, including Naushon Island. This
   effect does not seem to be regulated by cattle deposition of N in the
   soil or the N-plant diversity relationship. Our results of the N-plant
   diversity relationship differ from the mainstream understanding, perhaps
   due to Naushon's sandy and infertile soils.}},

Abstract = {{Questions Grazing management influences grassland community dynamics,
   but few studies exist on the effects of specific management regimes in
   subtropical grasslands. Here, we ask how rotational and continuous
   grazing influences the composition, diversity, and biomass production of
   natural grasslands in southern Brazil. Location The study was conducted
   at four cattle farms within the south Brazilian grassland region (Campos
   Sulinos), in the upper area of the Camaqua river basin of Rio Grande do
   Sul, Brazil. Methods On each farm, grassland that had previously been
   subjected to continuous grazing (freely grazed by cattle) was divided
   into two experimental units; one managed by rotational grazing and the
   other maintained under continuous grazing. In each experimental unit, 14
   permanent plots were monitored over six years for species composition
   and species biomass. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models to
   evaluate the effects of grazing management strategies on composition
   dissimilarity, diversity indices, and plant biomass. Results Grasslands
   under a rotational grazing regime changed steadily over the period of
   evaluation. Total biomass and species distribution patterns greatly
   differed from those in plots subjected to continuous grazing, leading to
   changes in species richness, dominance, and composition, as well as to
   an increase in overall plant biomass. Conclusions Community changes
   during the six-year study period as a consequence of the distinct
   grazing treatments were evident. Grasslands under rotational grazing
   management benefitted from less selective grazing, enabling a more
   uniform growth of species within the communities, which in turn were
   richer at the end of the six-year experiment. In contrast, the
   proportion of grazing-resistant species or less-consumed species was
   higher under continuous grazing, where foraging by cattle appears to be
   more selective. Rotational grazing thus not only leads to higher species
   richness and diversity, but also to higher primary and, in consequence,
   secondary productivity.}},

Title = {{Traditional semi-natural grassland management with heterogeneous mowing
   times enhances flower resources for pollinators in agricultural
   landscapes}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{For a diverse pollinator fauna it is important that pollen and nectar
   are available over the entire summer at spatially relevant scales.
   Semi-natural hay meadows are among the most important sources of flower
   resources for pollinators, but the resources are strongly affected by
   the timing of mowing. Management recommendations for hay meadows often
   prescribe late mowing on order to allow undisturbed flowering during
   most of the summer. Traditional practices, however, often include also
   earlier mowing. We investigate the link between the temporal variation
   of flower resources and traditional mowing practices of semi-natural hay
   meadows in a low-intensity agricultural landscape in Romania. In early
   August, we botanically surveyed meadows that were cut early,
   intermediately, or late in the season. We recorded all herb species,
   their phenological stage, and the number of reproductive units of each
   species. Data were analysed using DCA, LM and GLM. Plant species
   richness and composition are not affected by the time of mowing, but
   different sets of species flower in semi-natural grasslands with
   different mowing regimes. In August the proportion of species flowering
   and flower density are highest in the early-mown meadows due to
   re-flowering after mowing. Analyses of phenological stages indicate that
   late-mown meadows are the main pollen and nectar sources in July,
   whereas meadows mown early are the main resource from August to the end
   of the season. The results demonstrate that for pollinator conservation,
   heterogeneous mowing times within a landscape need to be encouraged when
   possible, and that strict focus on late mowing may lead to shortage of
   flower resources late in the summer. Studies of low-intensity
   agriculture has a great potential for learning about management methods
   that can be used in other parts of the world where traditional practices
   have been lost. Such studies can thereby contribute with important
   knowledge to manage global pollinator loss. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{During the past centuries human-induced land use changes resulted in a
   considerable loss of natural habitats worldwide. In transformed
   landscapes historical burial places such as cemeteries and churchyards
   can have the potential for biodiversity conservation. In our review we
   aimed at evaluating the conservation role of these sites and at
   revealing factors that can threaten their biota. Altogether we evaluated
   the results of 97 relevant studies from five continents. We found that
   cemeteries and churchyards have a considerable conservation role, as
   even in heavily transformed landscapes they often act as refuges for the
   populations of rare and endangered species; altogether 140 protected
   taxa were listed in the reviewed studies. We revealed that the high
   biodiversity of burial places is supported by their long-term existence
   and their undisturbed status. However, in parallel with changes in the
   social attitude the management of these natural refuges has also been
   altered worldwide. We identified the major threats for the flora and
   fauna to be altered burial habits decreasing the area of grasslands,
   intensified management of the cemeteries by frequent mowing and logging,
   the spontaneous and human-induced introduction of invasive species and
   the overexploitation of natural resources present in cemeteries. As
   conservation and spirituality is tightly interwoven in cemeteries, the
   preservation of these refuges can be achieved by the reconstruction of
   their sacred spirituality, by raising the attention of local populations
   for the natural values of these areas and also by specific, focused
   management providing proper habitats for the natural flora and fauna.

Title = {{Early post-fire bird community in European boreal forest: Comparing
   salvage-logged with non-intervention areas}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Salvage logging after disturbances in forests substantially modifies
   vegetation structure and dead wood availability, but empirical evidence
   on its impact on biodiversity, especially in European boreal forest, is
   sparse. In this study we investigated the short-term effect of post-fire
   salvage logging on species richness and abundance of birds in recently
   burned mixed coniferous forest. Using point counts we estimated local
   species composition at 49 salvaged sites and 55 non-intervention sites
   (burnt forest left for natural regeneration) that were not logged after
   a fire in south-central Sweden. Local species richness, abundance and
   Simpson's species diversity index were significantly higher at
   non-intervention sites compared to salvaged sites. Forest birds that
   rely on structurally complex forest stands, such as tits (Parus major,
   Lophophanes cristatus, Poecile montanus), robin (Erithacus rubecula),
   mistle trush (Turdus viscivorus) and tree-toed woodpecker (Picoides
   tridactylus) were mainly associated with non-intervention sites, while
   species that are typically linked to farm- or shrublands, such as
   whinchat (Saxicola rubetra), white wagtail (Motacilla alba), red-backed
   shrike (Lanius collurio), and meadow pipit (Anthus pratensis) were more
   common at salvaged sites. These results are consistent with the idea
   that post-fire salvage logging has an immediate impact on the bird
   species composition and abundance in boreal forest. We conclude that
   although post-fire salvage logging may be beneficial for birds occurring
   in open landscapes, it has negative effects for forest bird species
   richness and abundance, at least over the short term. To protect typical
   forest communities with many forest specialists of high conservation
   concern, we recommend reducing the extent of post-disturbance salvaging
   in forests of high conservation value and updating the existing
   management policy to restore the amount of woody debris and facilitate
   long-term structural complexity and biodiversity in densely stocked
   conifer stands. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock and small burrowing mammals are potential ecosystem engineers
   and major drivers of ecosystem processes. Small mammals, often
   considered competitors with livestock, have been reported to increase in
   recent years and have been identified for their negative impacts on
   ecosystem services such as plant production and soil carbon
   sequestration. However, these increases and impacts by small mammals
   have rarely been studied with respect to how they may be influenced by
   livestock grazing. Here we experimentally manipulated large enclosures
   on the alpine grassland of Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, each with different
   livestock assemblages: yak (Bos grunniens), Tibetan sheep (Ovis aries),
   mixed populations of yak and sheep, and a control plot containing no
   livestock to study the potential impacts of livestock on the dominant
   small mammalian herbivore in the region, the plateau pikas (Ochotona
   curzoniae). We found that during the period of peak vegetative growth
   all pika populations in livestock experimental plots increased compared
   with those in the control plots. Additionally, pika populations and
   active pika burrow density increased more in experimental plots
   containing yaks compared with the sheep-only experimental plots. These
   results provide evidence that livestock grazing can increase the risk of
   pika outbreaks, which has led to this species being classified as a pest
   and subject to widespread control measures. We suggest explicitly
   incorporating livestock species identity in addition to grazing
   intensity and duration into management considerations to ensure
   maintenance of native biodiversity and long-term sustain ability on the
   alpine grasslands of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands are rich in biodiversity and thus important
   habitats for conservation, yet they are experiencing rapid declines due
   to agricultural intensification and abandonment. Promoting a more
   diverse mammalian herbivore community, including large and
   megaherbivores, may result in positive cascade effects for biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning. Therefore, reintroducing an ecologically
   functional substitute of an extinct large herbivore could mitigate
   current biodiversity declines and foster semi-natural grassland
   conservation. To test this hypothesis, we set up a 3-year rewilding
   experiment where 12 feral horses were introduced in three 10-hectare
   enclosure replicates (four horses per enclosure). We used
   community-weighted mean plant functional traits to elucidate plant
   community changes induced by grazing through time. We also investigated
   the effects of this experimental treatment on insect pollinated plants
   and on pollinator habitat use. The grassland community exerted a mixed
   tolerance/avoidance response to grazing. This resulted in plant
   functional compositional changes which favoured prostrate plant species
   with higher specific leaf area, characteristic of ruderal communities.
   Plant species richness was higher in grazed compared to ungrazed areas.
   Butterfly and bumblebee habitat use, as well as feeding and resting
   activities were also higher in grazed areas. Moreover, the number of
   pollinators increased with plant species richness.Synthesis and
   applications. This study demonstrates that, to enhance the diversity of
   a given herbivore community with ecological replacements of extinct wild
   horses can have significant effects on the functional composition of
   grasslands. It can also mitigate plant species declines, in particular
   bee-dependent plants, and boost pollinator habitat use. Novel management
   alternatives are urgently needed to reverse the negative effect of land
   abandonment in European agricultural landscapes. Thus, rewilding
   interventions with large mammalian herbivores may offset current
   biodiversity declines by maintaining important functional links between
   plants and pollinators in grassland ecosystems.

   This study demonstrates that, to enhance the diversity of a given
   herbivore community with ecological replacements of extinct wild horses
   can have significant effects on the functional composition of
   grasslands. It can also mitigate plant species declines, in particular
   bee-dependent plants, and boost pollinator habitat use. Novel management
   alternatives are urgently needed to reverse the negative effect of land
   abandonment in European agricultural landscapes. Thus, rewilding
   interventions with large mammalian herbivores may offset current
   biodiversity declines by maintaining important functional links between
   plants and pollinators in grassland ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 150 years, semi-natural grasslands have suffered from
   either large-scale intensification of land use or abandonment.
   Lepidoptera are excellent model organisms to study the effects of
   land-use changes. In this study, we analysed the effects of landscape
   quality and habitat quality on the patch occupancy of twospecialist
   Lepidoptera species, the butterfly Erebia medusa and the burnet moth
   Adscita statices, in small but well-connected semi-natural grasslands
   (N=71) in central Germany. Our study revealed that habitat quality was
   the main driver of patch occupancy of the two species. The generalized
   linear model analysis revealed that the occurrence of both species was
   determined by the litter volume. Additionally, for A. statices the cover
   of the host plants (Rumex acetosella and R. acetosa) was a further
   predictor. In contrast, landscape quality had only a minor role on patch
   occupancy. For both species, the observed population structure resembled
   a classical metapopulation of the Levins type consisting of many small
   and highly connected patches. In the short and medium term, abandonment
   was beneficial for both species, as it maintained the litter layer. In
   the long run it would lead to vegetation dominated by competitive,
   high-growing grasses (e.g., Arrhenatherum elatius) and a decreasing
   cover of the less competitive host plants, especially Festuca ovina agg.
   and R. acetosella. Hence, we would recommend rotational grazing or
   mowing, if sufficiently large parts of the habitats were not under
   management every year.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands in northern China form an important ecological barrier that
   prevents and controls desertification. The Beijing-Tianjin Sand Source
   Control (BTSSC) Project has been implemented to restore grassland in
   order to control sand sourced pollution. This study aimed to understand
   the impacts of four applied restoration practices on the productivity,
   composition, and species diversity of vegetation communities in the
   BTSSC Project. The results indicated the following: (1) All the
   restoration practices tended to increase the height and cover of
   communities, and the effect was most obvious where grazing was excluded;
   (2) total biomass (87\%), above-ground biomass (164\%) and below-ground
   biomass (58\%) only increased consistently when grazing was excluded
   from the steppe; (3) fenced and grazing exclusion practice significantly
   increased the abundance of species in communities, but all the practices
   tended to decrease the evenness of species; and, (4) the correlation
   analysis revealed that the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and Pielou
   evenness index, showed significant negative correlations with the
   above-ground biomass of grassland communities after restoration, while
   no significant relationships were shown in reference plots. Our
   comparison of applied practices in the BTSSC project revealed that
   grazing exclusion might be a high priority for more successful
   restoration in this region.}},

Abstract = {{Fertilization is a common management measure for the restoration of
   degraded grasslands. In order to investigate whether fertilization can
   improve the severely degraded alpine meadows, we conducted a
   fertilization experiment on the Tibetan Plateau that began in 2008. The
   treatments were nitrogen (N) addition alone (50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1),
   LN; 100 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), HN) or combined with phosphorus (P)
   fertilizer {[}(50 kg N + 50 kg P) ha(-1) year(-1), LN+P; (100 kg N + 50
   kg P) ha(-1) year(-1), HN + P] in a severely degraded alpine meadow.
   Eleven consecutive years of N and P fertilization did not significantly
   change plant species richness, while fertilization reduced the plant
   species diversity index, with the most significant reduction in HN and
   HN + P treatments. LN + P and HN + P treatments greatly increased
   community coverage and aboveground biomass, while N addition alone,
   especially the HN treatment, significantly reduced community coverage
   and aboveground biomass. Fertilization had no effect on edible pastures,
   while N and P fertilization significantly increased the biomass of
   forbs. The proportion of forbs to total aboveground biomass was more
   than 90\%, and fertilization had no effect on this proportion. This
   shows that forbs still have an absolute advantage in the community. In
   addition, HN, LN + P, and HN + P treatments significantly reduced
   ecosystem stability. Community aboveground biomass was greatly enhanced
   in the N and P fertilization treatments, and this was beneficial for the
   ecosystem quality and soil hydrological functioning. However,
   fertilization treatments did not improve the community structure with
   either N addition alone or combined with P fertilizer, which was of
   little significance in providing forages for the sustainable development
   of livestock husbandry. To improve the structure of severely degraded
   alpine grasslands, it is necessary to combine other measures such as
   cutting the roots of forbs, fencing, or reseeding.}},

Abstract = {{Sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata) is a high-tannin, late season
   invasive forb species that reduces biodiversity in tallgrass prairie
   ecosystems. The largest tallgrass prairie remnant exists in the Flint
   Hills of Kansas and Oklahoma, where the most common grazing management
   practice involves prescribed fire in early spring followed by intensive
   stocking with yearling beef cattle from April to July. Sericea has
   continued to spread under this management regime. From 2013 to 2016, in
   Kansas Flint Hills tallgrass prairie, we tested the effects of using
   spring burning with early-season steer grazing, followed by late-season
   sheep grazing (Steer-I-Sheep) compared to spring burning followed by
   steer grazing only (Steer) on sericea vigor, grassland birds, and
   pollinators. Density and nest success of Grasshopper Sparrows
   (Ammodrannts savannarum) and Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna) were
   not negatively affected by Steer-I-Sheep relative to Steer treatments,
   whereas there was evidence of a negative effect in these same metrics
   for Dickcissels (Spiro americana). Abundance of butterflies and their
   nectar sources were similar between treatments but abundance of
   grassland specialist butterfly species was low, overall.
   Comprehensively, Steer-I-Sheep effectively controls the spread of
   sericea but may not create habitat for all tallgrass prairie wildlife

Abstract = {{Black-tailed prairie dogs are herbivorous rodents known to have large
   effects on grassland landscapes in North America. They have considerable
   impacts on prairie plant communities as the result of repeated clipping
   of vegetation that can reduce preferred forage species and may
   indirectly result in increased abundance of disturbance-tolerant
   species. We investigated plant communities within three different
   habitat types: Active and inactive prairie dog colonies, and adjacent
   suitable, but unoccupied, control areas in the Northern Great Plains of
   Montana, U.S.A. Plant species richness did not vary markedly between the
   three habitat types. However, plant composition measured as cover of
   plant life forms (forbs, shrubs, and graminoids), which was further
   divided into native status (native or introduced), and plant species
   indicators (plant species associated with a specific habitat) did vary
   distinctly between the three habitat types. Differences in plant
   composition between the habitat types suggests black-tailed prairie dog
   activities result in greater diversity of plant microhabitats at a
   landscape scale, and prairie dogs are an important component of the
   overall ecosystem in the Northern Great Plains of North America.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{501-504}},

Abstract = {{Targeted grazing is a promising strategy for addressing management
   issues in annual grasslands. We evaluated targeted cattle grazing
   strategies for tarweed (Hemizonia fitchii A. Gray) and vinegarweed
   (Trichostema lanceolatum Benth.). These native annual forbs provide
   biodiversity to annual grass-dominated landscapes, in addition to being
   important pollinator plants that discourage yellow starthistle
   (Centaurea solstitialis L.) invasion. However, these forbs can form
   dense stands that interfere with grazing. Therefore, we sought grazing
   strategies that promote sparse stands to maintain livestock production
   while supporting other ecosystem services. Treatments were 1) early
   grazing when dominant annual grasses were vegetative, 2) late grazing
   when grasses were senescing, 3) repeated grazing, and 4) a nongrazed
   control. These treatments were applied in 2011, 2012, and 2013. In 2012,
   neither tarweed nor vinegarweed were observed regardless of treatment,
   likely due to low water availability during their major growth period.
   In 2011 and 2013, grazing grasses repeatedly throughout the growing
   season increased tarweed to 3-5 plants m(-2), compared with < 1 plants
   m(-2) in the control, and in 2011 repeated grazing also increased
   vinegarweed. Therefore, although environmental factors can prevent
   tarweed and vinegarweed from forming stands some years, defoliating
   grasses repeatedly from vegetative through senesced stages is the most
   reliable way to encourage these forbs in annual grasslands. However, a
   single period of defoliation can also encourage tarweed: In 2011 and
   2013, we found a single period of grazing as annual grasses senesced and
   tarweed began rapid growth increased tarweed, possibly by increasing
   light availability. Finally, we found grazing once early in the growing
   season provided low tarweed and vinegarweed densities, likely because
   the long postgrazing period allowed annual grasses to recover and
   competitively suppress these forbs. Therefore, early grazing may
   reduce/prevent overly dense tarweed and vinegarweed stands. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {{Prosopis juliflora (Swartz) DC., an invasive alien plant species, is
   known as a threat to biodiversity and ecosystem services world over. It
   has heavily invaded community grazing lands (CGLs) in the Indian Thar
   Desert. The present study reports effects of four canopy sizes, (i.e.
   small, medium, large and no-canopy/open plot), of P. julflora shrub on
   native vegetation and soil fertility (0-20 cm depth) in the CGLs
   distributed in Jodhpur, Pali, and Sirohi districts in the Desert. In
   addition, economic profitability of P. juliflora based three
   enterprises, (i.e. charcoal making, pod-flour making, and sheep rearing
   in the grasslands if developed in the CGLs), was evaluated to find out
   invasion control measures of the shrub through utilization. Soil organic
   carbon (SOC), total N, available P and K, and mineral N (NO3--N, NH4+-N)
   and soil-moisture contents were higher under the shrub canopy than in
   open plot; and they were the highest under the large and lowest under
   the small canopy sizes. But, light intensity (Lux) declined under the
   canopy. The decline, however, was the highest under the large and lowest
   under the small canopy sizes. Composition of native plant species
   changed and their richness and diversity declined under the canopy, but
   was higher under the larger canopy size. Economic analyses revealed that
   investment was the highest (5476US\$ ha(-1)) in the charcoal and lowest
   (486US\$ ha(-1)) in pod-flour enterprise, but gross profit and net
   present value (NPV) were the highest (10740US\$ ha(-1) and 5264US\$
   ha(-1), respectively) in the charcoal and lowest (895US\$ ha(-1) and
   409US\$ ha(-1), respectively) in pod-flour enterprise. Other economic
   parameters, like the annuity and internal rate of return (IRR), were
   also the highest in the charcoal and lowest in pod-flour enterprise
   suggesting that the charcoal enterprise is economically the most
   profitable enterprise; and it may control the invasion of the P.
   juliflora in the Desert.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Land-use intensification is a major driver of local species extinction
   and homogenization. Temperate grasslands, managed at low intensities
   over centuries harbored a high species diversity, which is increasingly
   threatened by the management intensification over the last decades. This
   includes key taxa like ants. However, the underlying mechanisms leading
   to a decrease in ant abundance and species richness as well as changes
   in functional community composition are not well understood. We sampled
   ants on 110 grassland plots in three regions in Germany. The sampled
   grasslands are used as meadows or pastures, being mown, grazed or
   fertilized at different intensities. We analyzed the effect of the
   different aspects of land use on ant species richness, functional trait
   spaces, and community composition by using a multimodel inference
   approach and structural equation models. Overall, we found 31 ant
   species belonging to 8 genera, mostly open habitat specialists. Ant
   species richness, functional trait space of communities, and abundance
   of nests decreased with increasing land-use intensity. The land-use
   practice most harmful to ants was mowing, followed by heavy grazing by
   cattle. Fertilization did not strongly affect ant species richness.
   Grazing by sheep increased the ant species richness. The effect of
   mowing differed between species and was strongly negative for Formica
   species while Myrmica and common Lasius species were less affected. Rare
   species occurred mainly in plots managed at low intensity. Our results
   show that mowing less often or later in the season would retain a higher
   ant species richness-similarly to most other grassland taxa. The
   transformation from (sheep) pastures to intensively managed meadows and
   especially mowing directly affects ants via the destruction of nests and
   indirectly via loss of grassland heterogeneity (reduced plant species
   richness) and increased soil moisture by shading of fast-growing plant
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the temporal scaling of biodiversity, typically described as
   species-time relationships (STRs), in the face of global climate change
   is a central issue in ecology because it is fundamental to biodiversity
   preservation and ecosystem management. However, whether and how climate
   change affects microbial STRs remains unclear, mainly due to the
   scarcity of long-term experimental data. Here, we examine the STRs and
   phylogenetic-time relationships (PTRs) of soil bacteria and fungi in a
   long-term multifactorial global change experiment with warming (+3
   degrees C), half precipitation (-50\%), double precipitation (+100\%)
   and clipping (annual plant biomass removal). Soil bacteria and fungi all
   exhibited strong STRs and PTRs across the 12 experimental conditions.
   Strikingly, warming accelerated the bacterial and fungal STR and PTR
   exponents (that is, the w values), yielding significantly (P < 0.001)
   higher temporal scaling rates. While the STRs and PTRs were
   significantly shifted by altered precipitation, clipping and their
   combinations, warming played the predominant role. In addition,
   comparison with the previous literature revealed that soil bacteria and
   fungi had considerably higher overall temporal scaling rates (w =
   0.39-0.64) than those of plants and animals (w = 0.21-0.38). Our results
   on warming-enhanced temporal scaling of microbial biodiversity suggest
   that the strategies of soil biodiversity preservation and ecosystem
   management may need to be adjusted in a warmer world.}},

Abstract = {{Globally, agricultural land use is implicated in the decline of
   avifauna. In rangelands (areas used for livestock grazing), bird
   community responses to grazing can be complex, species-specific and
   scale dependent. A greater understanding of bird responses to grazing
   will lead to more meaningful management recommendations. We tested the
   hypothesis that foraging height predicts bird species' responses to
   grazing, such that species using lower vegetation strata are most likely
   to respond to the impacts of livestock grazing. We examined the response
   of a tropical savanna bird community to four grazing strategies at a
   long-term grazing trial in northern Australia. We predicted that
   ground-foraging guilds would be more responsive to grazing treatment
   than foliage- or aerial-foraging guilds. We analysed the bird community
   assemblage using generalised linear mixed models and examined individual
   species' abundance in relation to microhabitat variables. We found that
   while ground-foraging guilds were more responsive to grazing treatment,
   individual species dynamics within a foraging guild could be
   contradictory. For example, the red-backed fairy-wren decreased in
   abundance with increased grazing and was positively associated with
   grass and shrub (Carissa ovata) cover, whereas Australian magpies
   increased in abundance in the most heavily grazed paddocks. In general,
   the responses of bird species to grazing were more pronounced in guilds
   that forage closer to the ground, but whether the responses were
   positive or negative was driven by bird species ecology. Measures
   examining the responses of individual species are more useful than
   assemblage measures (such as richness) to describe the impacts of
   anthropogenic disturbance such as grazing.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Livestock grazing and fire can intensively modify montane meadows.
   Understanding how these factors affect habitat, species richness, and
   diversity of small mammals can inform management decisions. Few studies
   have investigated the independent and synergistic effects of grazing and
   wildfire on vegetation and small-mammal communities, and none have
   focused on montane meadows in the southwestern United States. In 2012
   and 2013, we captured small mammals at 105 sites to contrast occupancy,
   species richness, and diversity among livestock grazing levels (present,
   absent), wildfire severity (unburned, low, or moderate), and meadow
   classifications (small or large, wet or dry) in Arizona, USA. During
   13,741 trap nights, we captured 1,885 rodents of 8 species. Two species
   represented 88\% of captures: deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and
   Arizona montane vole (Microtus montanus arizonensis). Deer mice, Navajo
   Mogollon voles (Microtus mogollonensis navaho), and thirteen-lined
   ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus monticola; a subspecies
   endemic to the White Mountains, AZ) had higher occupancy in large,
   ungrazed meadows compared to small, grazed meadows. Species richness was
   greater in unburned than burned sites and small meadows than large.
   However, higher diversity occurred in ungrazed and dry compared to
   grazed and wet meadows. Three species demonstrated weak relationships
   between wildfire and occupancy, suggesting short-term (<2 yrs) effects
   of low to moderate burn severity for these species or their habitat.
   Livestock grazing had a greater effect than wildfire on the small-mammal
   community by altering vegetation or other habitat elements and thus
   decreasing population sizes. Reducing livestock grazing would benefit
   small-mammal species and increase diversity and abundance of the
   small-mammal community in montane meadows. (c) 2019 The Wildlife

   as suitable butterfly habitats, although they could potentially sustain
   diverse butterfly populations over time. We analysed the temporal change
   in butterfly species assemblages in urban green spaces in the city of
   Malmo, Southern Sweden. We studied changes in species richness and
   abundance of butterflies between 2006 and 2015 in 20 public urban green
   spaces, characterized by different management regimes. We sampled
   butterflies in traditional parks with intense grass cutting regimes, in
   semi-natural grasslands mowed only a few times per year, and in
   un-managed or irregularly managed ruderal sites. We found a slight
   increase in the total number of butterfly species in the study area, but
   a general decline in local species numbers in urban green spaces.
   Traditional urban parks had the greatest loss of species over time, and
   altogether the lowest number of species. In contrast, semi-natural parks
   and ruderal sites had higher numbers of butterfly species and also lost
   fewer species over time. Our study shows that intensive management
   strategies in urban green spaces have a negative impact on butterfly
   assemblages over time. We suggest that less intensive management
   strategies can be used to create high-quality areas for flower-visiting
   insects in urban green spaces, possibly in combination with planting
   larval host plant species, depending on the park type and design.}},

Abstract = {{Despite growing recognition of the conservation values of grassy biomes,
   our understanding of how to maintain and restore biodiverse tropical
   grasslands (including savannas and open-canopy grassy woodlands) remains
   limited. To incorporate grasslands into large-scale restoration efforts,
   we synthesised existing ecological knowledge of tropical grassland
   resilience and approaches to plant community restoration. Tropical
   grassland plant communities are resilient to, and often dependent on,
   the endogenous disturbances with which they evolved - frequent fires and
   native megafaunal herbivory. In stark contrast, tropical grasslands are
   extremely vulnerable to human-caused exogenous disturbances,
   particularly those that alter soils and destroy belowground biomass
   (e.g. tillage agriculture, surface mining); tropical grassland
   restoration after severe soil disturbances is expensive and rarely
   achieves management targets. Where grasslands have been degraded by
   altered disturbance regimes (e.g. fire exclusion), exotic plant
   invasions, or afforestation, restoration efforts can recreate vegetation
   structure (i.e. historical tree density and herbaceous ground cover),
   but species-diverse plant communities, including endemic species, are
   slow to recover. Complicating plant-community restoration efforts, many
   tropical grassland species, particularly those that invest in
   underground storage organs, are difficult to propagate and re-establish.
   To guide restoration decisions, we draw on the old-growth grassland
   concept, the novel ecosystem concept, and theory regarding tree cover
   along resource gradients in savannas to propose a conceptual framework
   that classifies tropical grasslands into three broad ecosystem states.
   These states are: (1) old-growth grasslands (i.e. ancient, biodiverse
   grassy ecosystems), where management should focus on the maintenance of
   disturbance regimes; (2) hybrid grasslands, where restoration should
   emphasise a return towards the old-growth state; and (3) novel
   ecosystems, where the magnitude of environmental change (i.e. a shift to
   an alternative ecosystem state) or the socioecological context preclude
   a return to historical conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic monitoring of above ground biomass is a vital component for
   effective management of rangelands health and productivity. Rangelands
   in Gilgit-Baltistan are dominant land-use forms, spanning over 25\%
   (16450.5 km(2)) of its total area, and contributing about 30-40\% in the
   total household income. The present research is an attempt to document
   the field based above ground biomass assessment of selected rangelands
   in the Hindu-Kush, Karakorum and Himalayan (HKH) regions of Pakistan and
   to relate it with the current livestock numbers in order to assess the
   grazing pressure on these rangelands. Five sampling plots (1km(2)) at 17
   catchments of five watersheds, representing the three mountain ranges
   were randomly selected for the study. The mean elevation of sampling
   plots ranged from 2500 m to 4100 masl. Within each sampling plot 3
   quadrats (1m(2)) were chosen, located, at least, 250 m apart from each
   other. For each of the sampling plot plant species were identified,
   biomass was calculated, and evenness and diversity of species was
   determined. On average the wet as well as dry biomass, across all the
   grazing areas was 2279 kg/ha and 650 kg/ha, respectively, with highest
   in Khunjerab (2831 and 704 kg/ha) and lowest in Bathraite (1590 and 596
   kg/ha). About 138 species belonging to 27 families were recorded from
   the study areas. The highest species richness was found in the Deosai
   Plains (11) followed by Bathraite (10). It was observed that the grazing
   areas nearest to the permanent settlement have highest non-palatable
   species, possibly due to extensive grazing. Grazing pressure in all
   pastures is increasing with maximum in Babosar and Bathraite, showing
   decline in productivity of the rangelands at these sites. Grazing
   management can improve pastures conditions as evident from high biomass
   in Khunjerab, attributed to grazing management under the National Park
   regime. This research will provide a baseline study for further research
   on rangeland management activities in the area and their sustainability.}},

Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that consumers may stabilise or destabilise plant
   production depending on model assumptions, and tests in aquatic food
   webs suggest that trophic interactions are stabilising. We quantified
   the effects of trophic interactions on temporal variability (standard
   deviation) and temporal stability (mean/standard deviation) of grassland
   biomass production and the plant diversity-stability relationship by
   experimentally removing heterotrophs (large vertebrates, arthropods,
   foliar and soil fungi) from naturally and experimentally assembled
   grasslands of varying diversity. In both grassland types, trophic
   interactions proportionately decreased plant community biomass mean and
   variability over the course of 6 years, leading to no net change in
   temporal stability or the plant diversity-stability relationship.
   Heterotrophs also mediated plant coexistence; their removal reduced
   diversity in naturally assembled grasslands. Thus, herbivores and fungi
   reduce biomass production, concurrently reducing the temporal
   variability of energy and material fluxes. Because of this coupling,
   grassland stability is robust to large food web perturbations.}},

Abstract = {{The Natura 2000 network is crucial to conserve biodiversity in the
   European Union and provides hotspots for certain ecosystem services.
   Grazing, a common land use in different Natura 2000habitat types, may
   contribute to the maintenance of protected plant communities and reduce
   fuel loads and wildfire hazard. Our study aims to assess the effects of
   grazing on plant composition and conservation status of calcareous
   shrub-grassland Natura 2000 habitat types, as well as its effects on
   fire hazard reduction and aboveground carbon storage. We surveyed plant
   communities grazed by goats in fenced (ungrazed) and open (grazed) plots
   in a mosaic of calcareous shrub-grassland habitat types and assessed
   plant species composition and habitat conservation status. We also
   assessed aboveground plant biomass in grazed and ungrazed plots and
   modelled potential fire behaviour in those plots for each habitat. With
   the exception of cryptogams, grazing did not affect plant cover, but
   positively affected species richness (mean +/- SD: 26.80 +/- 11.65 vs.
   29.37 +/- 8.59, P=0.01; fenced vs. unfenced) and Shannon diversity (2.11
   +/- 0.81 vs. 2.33 +/- 0.55, P<0.01) in the habitat mosaic. Furthermore,
   grazing did not affect the conservation status of two out of three of
   the studied habitat types. Additionally, grazing decreased the fire
   hazard in grass and dwarf shrub communities without reducing aboveground
   carbon stocks significantly. Our results show that moderate grazing is a
   management practice that effectively contribute to the conservation of
   Natura 2000 shrub-grassland habitat types through reduction of wildfire
   hazard and maintenance of habitat conservation status.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands in Inner Mongolia have been confronted with unprecedented
   degradation in recent years. Research on ecosystem stability is
   important to inform evaluation of the health of degraded grassland
   ecosystems. We examined synthetic stability, which was defined by the
   relationships between multiple components of stability, known as
   multidimensional stability, in grasslands at four stages of degradation
   (undegraded, slightly degraded, moderately degraded, and intensely
   degraded) in the Xilin River Basin, Inner Mongolia, China. We analyzed
   the connections between multidimensional stability and its relationship
   with four stability components, including community resistance and
   recovery measured on the basis of plant functional traits, and community
   functional (aboveground net primary productivity) and structural
   (Jaccard dissimilarity) variability, calculated on the basis of ten
   plots from different spatial distributions in a study site. Our results
   showed that (i) 9 of 17 traits displayed a significant trend along the
   grazing intensity gradient, indicating a clear turnover of species
   within communities in response to the grazing intensity gradient; (ii)
   moderately degraded (C) grasslands showed higher recovery, resistance,
   and synthetic stability than undegraded (A) and slightly degraded (B)
   grassland communities overall (recovery: p = 0.026, p = 0.032, for pairs
   of samples from A and C, and B and C, respectively; resistance: p =
   0.024, for a pair of samples from A and C), which conformed with the
   intermediate disturbance hypothesis and positive diversity-stability
   relationship; and (iii) the multidimensionality of stability varied
   between different stages of degradation and were strongly dependent upon
   the correlations between stability components. Our study is expected to
   enrich the theory of stability maintenance in grassland ecosystems and
   provide guidance for grassland restoration and biodiversity
   conservation. (c) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Effects of grazing intensity to water source on grassland condition,
   yield and nutritional content of selected grass species in Northwest
   Ethiopia}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 31}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundSavanna grasslands are globally important ecosystems
   consisting of one of the most extensive grazing lands with unique
   biodiversity. The objectives of the study were to assess the effect of
   grazing intensity on grassland ecosystem condition, herbaceous plant
   biomass production, and nutritional content of selected grass
   species.MethodsThe study was conducted at Chagni Ranch, Northwest
   Ethiopia. Four transects to water source point at regular intervals of
   20m between sampling plots along transects were used for data
   collection. The distance between the four transects was 200m in radius.
   Data were collected on grass composition, basal cover, litter cover,
   number of seedlings, and age distribution of dominant grasses (i.e.,
   young, medium, or old in terms of stage of maturity), soil condition in
   terms of soil compaction, and soil erosion linked to the effects of
   trampling by grazing animals along transects (hereafter referred to as
   transect) to water source point. The total sample size for grass species
   was 160 plots. The grassland ecosystem condition, herbaceous biomass,
   and grass nutritional content were used as response variables linked to
   transect from water source point. The effects of transect on grassland
   ecosystem condition scores and grass nutritional content were analyzed
   using the analysis of variance (ANOVA).ResultsGrassland condition
   factors like grass composition, basal cover, litter cover, age
   distribution of dominant grasses, and soil condition were significantly
   (P<0.05) higher for the furthest transect to water source point than
   nearest transect. Out of the 28 identified herbaceous species, grasses
   accounted for 64.3\% of the herbaceous community. Within grass species,
   about 55.6\% were highly desirable in terms of palatability and grazing
   value (as most palatable species are susceptible to heavy grazing
   intensity). The results showed a significantly (P<0.05) higher
   proportion of perennial grasses at the furthest transect to water source
   point than nearest transect. The dry matter yield at the furthest
   transect (TD4) and third transect (TD3) were significantly (P<0.05)
   higher than the nearest transect to water source point (i.e., the first
   transect (TD1) and second transect (TD2)). Ash, neutral detergent fiber,
   acid detergent fiber, and acid detergent lignin contents of Cynodon
   dactylon, Sporobolus pyramidalis, and Digitaria ternata were
   significantly (P<0.05) higher at the furthest transect to water source
   point than nearest transect. Grazing intensity had no significant effect
   on the crude protein content of Cynodon dactylon and Sporobolus
   pyramidalis at different transects.ConclusionsThe results showed that
   the furthest transect to water source point were in good condition.
   Grass biomass production and the nutritional contents of grasses were
   higher for the furthest transect to water source point. The results
   suggested that increased grazing intensity towards water source point
   greatly reduced the abundance of desirable perennial grasses and the
   sustainability of grassland for livestock production.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{Humans modify ecosystems and biodiversity worldwide, with negative
   consequences for ecosystem functioning. Promoting plant diversity is
   increasingly suggested as a mitigation strategy. However, our
   mechanistic understanding of how plant diversity affects the diversity
   of heterotrophic consumer communities remains limited. Here, we
   disentangle the relative importance of key components of plant diversity
   as drivers of herbivore, predator, and parasitoid species richness in
   experimental forests and grasslands. We find that plant species richness
   effects on consumer species richness are consistently positive and
   mediated by elevated structural and functional diversity of the plant
   communities. The importance of these diversity components differs across
   trophic levels and ecosystems, cautioning against ignoring the
   fundamental ecological complexity of biodiversity effects. Importantly,
   plant diversity effects on higher trophic-level species richness are in
   many cases mediated by modifications of consumer abundances. In light of
   recently reported drastic declines in insect abundances, our study
   identifies important pathways connecting plant diversity and consumer
   diversity across ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing plant diversity can increase ecosystem functioning,
   stability, and services in both natural and managed grasslands, but the
   effects of herbivore diversity, and especially of livestock diversity,
   remain underexplored. Given that managed grazing is the most extensive
   land use worldwide, and that land managers can readily change livestock
   diversity, we experimentally tested how livestock diversification
   (sheep, cattle, or both) influenced multidiversity (the diversity of
   plants, insects, soil microbes, and nematodes) and ecosystem
   multifunctionality (including plant biomass production, plant leaf N and
   P, above-ground insect abundance, nutrient cycling, soil C stocks, water
   regulation, and plant-microbe symbiosis) in the world's largest
   remaining grassland. We also considered the potential dependence of
   ecosystem multifunctionality on multidiversity. We found that livestock
   diversification substantially increased ecosystem multifunctionality by
   increasing multidiversity. The link between multidiversity and ecosystem
   multifunctionality was always stronger than the link between single
   diversity components and functions. Our work provides insights into the
   importance of multitrophic diversity to maintain multifunctionality in
   managed ecosystems and suggests that diversifying livestock could
   promote both multidiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality in an
   increasingly managed world.}},

Journal = {{AGROECOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE FOOD SYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Microbial communities in pasture and hayfield soils in upstate New York
   were studied to ascertain how land and livestock management practices
   influence microbial community structure. Three management approaches
   were compared: conventional pasture management (CM; low livestock
   density, low rotation frequency), multi-paddock management (MP; high
   livestock density, high rotation frequency) and mowing for hay (no
   livestock). Microbial functional groups were quantified by PLFA
   analysis. Soil attributes were measured, and management details were
   obtained by interviewing landowners. Microbial biomass in MP soils was
   higher, more diverse and contained proportionately more fungal (F) than
   bacterial (B) biomass than did CM and hayfield soils. Microbial biomass,
   diversity and F:B ratios in CM and hayfield soils were not different.
   Multivariate analyses suggest that different variables control microbial
   community structure in MP and CM soils.}},

Abstract = {{Angiosperm genome sizes (GS) vary ca 2400-fold. Recent research has
   shown that GS influences plant abundance, and plant competition. There
   are also tantalizing reports that herbivores may select plants as food
   dependent on their GS. To test the hypothesis that GS plays a role in
   shaping plant communities under herbivore pressure, we exploit a
   grassland experiment that has experimentally excluded herbivores and
   applied nutrient over 8 years. Using phylogenetically informed
   statistical models and path analyses, we show that under rabbit grazing,
   plant species with small GS generated the most biomass. By contrast, on
   mollusc and insect-grazed plots, it was the plant species with larger GS
   that increased in biomass. GS was also shown to influence plant
   community properties (e.g. competitive strategy, total biomass) although
   the impact varied between different herbivore guilds (i.e. rabbits
   versus invertebrates) and nutrient inputs. Overall, we demonstrate that
   GS plays a role in influencing plant-herbivore interactions, and suggest
   potential reasons for this response, which include the impact of GS on a
   plant's response to different herbivore guilds, and on a plant's
   nutrient quality. The inclusion of GS in ecological models has the
   potential to expand our understanding of plant productivity and
   community ecology under nutrient and herbivore stress.}},

Abstract = {{As the Third Pole of the world, the Tibetan Plateau provides a typical
   alpine grassland environment for soil bacteria with its unique frigid
   and arid climate. Owing to clear changes in spatial moisture and
   increased grazing intensity, moisture and livestock grazing have become
   key factors influencing the microbial communities. Accordingly, we
   investigated the diversity and composition of soil bacteria in a
   selected alpine grassland within the dual gradients of moisture and
   grazing using high-throughput sequencing. Our results showed that
   grazing changed the soil bacterial diversity and composition, whereas
   moisture only influenced the relative abundance of the segmental
   community at the small spatial scale. Species richness was found to be
   increased by moderate grazing compared with that by high or low-grazing
   intensity. The relative abundance of dominant species and beta-diversity
   of soil bacteria both showed differences with heavy, moderate, and low
   grazing. Some dominant bacteria were altered with the moisture content.
   However, there were no significant differences according to the moisture
   gradient in terms of the overall bacterial beta diversity and
   composition. These results might be taken account into the small spatial
   scale as well as the compensation of grazing to moisture on this scale.
   This work provides new insights into the soil bacterial response to
   moisture gradients and grazing intensity in alpine steppe habitat.}},

   (Poaceae) to diurnal light variation in an overgrazed grassland}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{266}},

Abstract = {{Overgrazed grasslands of Southern Brazil are responsible in part for the
   degradation, low productivity and loss of biodiversity of the grassland
   ecosystems submitted to such management. Axonopus affinis Chase, the
   carpet grass, is a dominant creeping grass species in overgrazed
   grasslands. The species readily spreads, is highly tolerant of frequent
   defoliation and to trampling. In any natural environment, different
   light intensity regimes vary considerably along the day. Such phenomenon
   requires a high level of plasticity, resistance, and resilience from
   plants. Within this context, the aim of this study was to describe the
   mechanisms of photochemical activity in Axonopus affinis (Poaceae) in
   response to natural variations in daylight. Here we report hysteresis
   related functional behavior in overgrazed grasslands. This study was
   conducted in grassland vegetation within an experimental overgrazed area
   from the Embrapa Pecuaria Sul, Bage/Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil (austral
   spring 2014). By means of preferential sampling, homogeneous areas with
   a 90\% dominance of Axonopus affinis Chase were selected. In the present
   study 60 sample units were analyzed (young leaves, non-damaged and fully
   expanded). Photochemical variables and OJIP curves were sampled in two
   distinct conditions along one day, under light intensities labeled as: 1
   - high photosynthetic photon flux density (HI), when under full
   sunlight; and 2 low photosynthetic photon flux density (LI), when under
   cloudy days. It was possible to quantify and identify the alternative
   stable states of A. affinis in response to light resource availability,
   expanding the interpretation of the multivariate analysis (triangular
   trajectory) and therefore, contributing to univariate metrics (bimodal
   trajectory). In this study, HI produced hysteretic behavior while LI of
   dynamic photoinhibition in A. affinis. The Delta F/F-m' variable was the
   most important mechanism to explain the plasticity of A. affinis in HI
   and LI (R-2 > 0.98 in function of the PCoA coordinates). However, the
   non-photochemical quenching activity was responsible for the stability
   in the OJIP curve. Therefore, A. affinis presented photochemical
   mechanisms that contribute to the occupation and dominance of overgrazed
   grasslands with different light regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Onobrychis viciifolia (Scop.) (sainfoin) is promoted in the Spanish

   interest in this legume crop is growing due to its rusticity and
   beneficial effects on the soil and livestock. However, the effect of the
   crop on weed flora in the subsequent cereal crops has hardly been
   investigated yet. With this aim, weed flora has been characterised in
   2011-2014 in sainfoin fields in the second and third year of
   establishment (S2 and S3), in cereal monocrop (CM), in cereal after
   sainfoin (CS) and in organic cereal fields (OC). Additionally, the soil
   seedbank was determined in two years in CM and S3 fields. Weed species
   richness of emerged flora and of the soil seedbank was highest for
   sainfoin and lowest for CM, being intermediate for OC and CS regardless
   of the sampling year. The most feared weed species in winter cereal did
   not increase by growing sainfoin or in CS compared to CM. Curiously,
   summer annuals dominated in the soil seedbank. Sainfoin fields cause
   thus a shift in the weed flora, which does not seem to damage subsequent
   cereal crops provided fields are mouldboard ploughed after sainfoin.}},

Abstract = {{Frothy bloat is an often fatal digestive disorder of cattle grazing
   alfalfa pastures. The aim of this study was to investigate ruminal and
   fecal microbiota dynamics associated with development of alfalfa-induced
   frothy bloat and to further explore how bloat prevention strategies

   crossover experiment, twelve rumen-cannulated steers were sequentially
   subjected to: (1) pure alfalfa pasture, (2) pure alfalfa pasture
   supplemented with the pluronic detergent ALFASURE, and (3) alfalfa -
   sainfoin mixed pasture. Eleven out of 12 steers in pure alfalfa pasture
   developed clinical bloat, whereas ALFASURE treatment prevented the
   development of bloat in all 12 steers and alfalfa - sainfoin prevented
   bloat in 5 out of 11 steers. Development of bloat was associated with
   considerable shifts in the microbiota profile of rumen contents. In
   particular, the microbiota of solid rumen contents from bloated steers
   contained higher species richness and diversity. Streptococcus,
   Succinivibrio and unclassified Myxococcales were enriched in the rumen
   microbiota of bloated steers, whereas Fibrobacter and Ruminococcus were
   overrepresented in the rumen contents of non-bloated steers. Our results

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing is an important determinant of species diversity and
   plant growth. Overgrazing is identified as one of the most important
   disturbances resulting in grassland degradation. Although many
   restoration practices have been implemented, grazing exclusion is one of
   the most effective methods to restore degraded grasslands. We explored
   the impact of five years of grazing exclusion on plant growth and
   species diversity in four types of grasslands: temperate steppe (TS),
   swamp meadow (SM), alpine steppe (AS), and alpine meadow (AM). Our
   results showed that grazing exclusion increased plant height, coverage,
   biomass, and species diversity in all four grasslands. The aboveground
   biomass in AM (180.8\%), TS (117.3\%), and SW (105.9\%) increased
   significantly more than AS (10.1\%). Grazing exclusion in AM had the
   greatest effect on proportion of palatable species, and the increase in
   palatable species in AM was higher than that of the other grassland
   types significantly. Species diversity increased significantly within
   the enclosure in SM (23.9\%) and AM (20.8\%). Our results indicate that
   grazing exclusion is an effective management strategy to restore
   degraded grasslands and it works best in alpine meadow. This study
   contributes to the growing theoretical basis for grassland management
   strategies and has a significant effect on sustainable development for
   grassland resources and pastoral areas.}},

Abstract = {{The organization of gall-inducing insect communities can be affected by
   environmental factors and host plant traits that may operate at
   different spatial scales. Using Copaifera oblongifolia (Fabaceae), we
   evaluated the organization of their associated gall-inducing insect
   species in different spatial scales considering the following
   hypotheses: (i) the community of gall-inducing insects will be different
   between different populations of C. oblongifolia; (ii) plant individuals
   with a greater number of neighbours (host plant density) will have a
   greater diversity of gall-inducing insects; (iii) and more structurally
   complex plants will support a greater diversity of gall-inducing
   insects. Data were collected from the three different populations of C.
   oblongifolia located in abandoned pastures of three different
   municipalities in northern Minas Gerais, Brazil. We recorded a total of
   17,843 galls belonging to 15 different gall-inducing insect species
   associated to 60 C. oblongifolia plants sampled in the three populations
   (20 individuals per population). Abundance, richness and composition of
   gall-inducing insect species were different between the populations,
   suggesting that local environmental conditions influenced the
   gall-inducing insect community at a regional scale. Host plant density
   negatively affected the richness and abundance of gall-inducing insects
   per plant. Our data did not corroborate the hypothesis of resource
   concentration, perhaps due to the effect of resource dilution. The
   biomass of the host plant positively influenced the abundance of
   gall-inducing insects per plant. However, the interaction between plant
   density and biomass of the plant suggests that plants with greater
   structural complexity are more attacked by gall-inducing insects in
   plots with lower number of neighbours.}},

Abstract = {{Question Does the effect of droppings and herbivory by wild guinea pigs
   on salt-marsh vegetation vary across microhabitats? Location Upper salt
   marsh in the Mar Chiquita coastal lagoon (37 degrees 44 ` 52 `' S, 57
   degrees 26 ` 6 `' W, Argentina). Methods During autumn 2014, we
   performed a micro-scale experiment manipulating droppings of wild guinea
   pigs (Cavia aperea). After 15 days, we compared the content of nutrients
   (i.e., NH4+, NO3-, and PO43-) in soil. Then, we started two factorial
   experiments in the high marsh, specifically one in marsh matrix (i.e.,
   tall vegetation) and the other in open patches (i.e., short vegetation).
   Units were randomly assigned to different treatments (with and without
   herbivores and droppings). In early summer, we compared total plant
   cover, maximum height, above-ground biomass, plant species richness and
   the composition of plant assemblages between treatments. Results
   Droppings increased the content of PO43- in soil by five times, but
   decreased the content of NO3-. Herbivory reduced total cover, plant
   height, and above-ground biomass in the marsh matrix and the open
   patches. In the marsh matrix, droppings increased the total cover,
   whereas herbivory reduced the abundance of Spartina densiflora (cover
   and above-ground biomass) and subordinate species (cover). Additionally,
   the cover of subordinate species was negatively associated with the
   cover of Spartina densiflora. Therefore, in the marsh matrix, by
   increasing light availability at the ground level, herbivory increased
   plant species richness, but with low cover of subordinate species. In
   contrast, in open patches, herbivory and droppings interacted to reduce
   plant species richness. Conclusion Herbivory by small mammals can
   control the above-ground biomass, structure, and plant community
   composition of the high marsh, but non-trophic mechanisms (droppings)
   can also affect community composition. Nonetheless, ecological impacts
   of small mammals depend on the context, because the magnitude and
   direction of trophic (herbivory) and non-trophic (droppings) effects
   change across microhabitats.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing and mowing are widely applied management practices in
   semi-natural grasslands, which are one of the most important habitats
   for biodiversity conservation in Europe. Due to the decline in
   extensively grazing livestock numbers, an increasing area of formerly
   grazed grasslands has being used as mown grasslands. However, we have
   scarce information on how arthropod assemblages are influenced by mowing
   in formerly grazed pastures. We assessed the effects of mowing compared
   to grazing on the species richness, abundance and functional diversity
   of arthropods in three grassland complexes in Hungary. Since 2005, these
   salt grasslands have been divided into two management units: extensive
   grazing management has been continued in one part, while annual late
   cutting has been established in the other part. In each management unit
   five sites were sampled. Spiders and ground beetles were sampled using
   pitfall traps, orthopterans and true bugs were sampled using sweep nets
   twice before cutting in 2015. In total, the data relating to 12,576
   adult individuals of 334 species were analysed using mixed-models.
   Plant-dwelling true bugs and orthopterans responded more sensitively to
   mowing than ground-dwelling spiders and ground beetles. Beside the
   general negative effect of mowing on the species richness and abundance
   of plant-dwelling arthropods, the shifts in the community weighted mean
   values of these assemblages suggested the importance of the body size,
   trophic behaviour and dispersal ability of species in the functional
   response of these assemblages to the different management regimes.
   Ground beetles and spiders were rather influenced by the differences in
   the moisture conditions and vegetation properties. Presumably, strong
   abiotic stressors such as drought can partly override management effects
   on ground-dwelling arthropods. The effect of uniform and simultaneous
   biomass removal on large areas, and the direct mortality caused by
   mowing was the most disadvantageous for plant-dwelling arthropods. Based
   on our results, traditional management practices should be prioritized
   in grassland conservation, as alternative management practices might be
   less effective in preserving grassland biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{General changes in land use have established patterns of modification of
   native vegetation into agricultural and grazing land. These production
   systems, as well as social and economic influences, have created diverse
   landscapes - mosaics composed of varied elements of vegetation cover
   (forests, crops, pastures, barren fields) that are distributed across
   spaces in different ways. In this investigation, we determine the
   distribution patterns of the richness, abundance and diversity of the
   bird community within the configuration and composition of agroforestry
   and silvopastoral landscapes. We observed 262 bird species, 6 720
   individuals, 23 orders and 54 families within 39 production system
   mosaics. None of the species accumulation curves in the production
   systems reached their asymptote, and the calculated estimators predicted
   a greater number of species than those observed during the survey. In
   general terms, richness, diversity and equitability indices were highest
   in the mosaics of agroforestry systems, while abundance and dominance
   indices were highest in the mosaics associated with silvopastoral and
   traditional livestock systems. Variables that describe vegetation cover
   in mosaics have different and independent effects on the diversity of
   bird assemblages and on the association of land use groups within the
   mosaics. The positive extreme of the first component contributes to the
   variance in the model of richness and diversity indices - both the
   structural components of landscapes and biological components of the
   assemblages. The area and disposition of different types of elements in
   the mosaics of the production system landscapes reflect the systematic
   management of covers, which affects the implications of landscape
   conservation and restoration practices. Different landscape elements
   serve as points of contact in the dispersion and distribution of species
   within these landscapes. The priority of conservation efforts and the
   first step for the restoration and connectivity of landscapes in the
   Andean Amazon of Colombia should be the management and protection of
   covers like old stubble or BFG and BRP. Another approach is the design
   of landscapes for entire communities of species with respect to certain
   quantities of habitats in the landscape and the isolation of patches.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines a 65-ha botanically rich grassland mosaic with
   extensive woody encroachment to determine whether prairie habitat can be
   restored over a six-year period post treatment. A stratified sample
   design was utilized for vegetation monitoring. Two vegetation types,
   Prairie and Old Field, were identified from baseline differences in
   species composition. Additional plots also were established in
   relatively undegraded prairie habitat. This Reference Prairie provided a
   restoration benchmark for Transect Prairie and Old Field on transects.
   Management efforts resulted in a 95\% reduction of woody stems, which
   were cut, piled, and burned on site. Cut stems were removed by hand in
   Reference Prairie; however, a compact track loader was used in remaining
   zones. Vegetation parameters of conservation interest based on species
   composition and diversity were utilized as predictor variables. We
   establish testable hypotheses and a statistical framework for evaluating
   mean differences and patterns of change among vegetation types.
   Reference Prairie retained baseline levels of floristic diversity and
   species integrity. However, it took six years for Transect Prairie to
   recover to baseline conditions. Old Field increased in native and
   non-native species richness leading to a floristic merger with
   recovering Transect Prairie; however, restoration goals fell short as
   Reference Prairie remained distinct in habitat quality from both
   successional community types. Our data suggest that population declines
   among resident species in Transect Prairie were a response to the more
   invasive management techniques. We recommend more gradual management
   practices to minimize the impacts of heavy equipment utilized for rapid
   and efficient treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Aboveground biomass (AGB) is a parameter commonly used for assessing and
   monitoring primary productivity of grassland communities. Destructive
   AGB measurements, although accurate, are time-consuming and do not allow
   for repeated measurements as required by monitoring protocols.
   Structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry has been proved to be a
   reliable tool for rapid and not destructive AGB estimations in grass
   systems. Three-dimensional (3D) models of fourteen 1 x 1 m(2) pasture
   plots were reconstructed and AGB volume measured under several
   measurement settings. Volume-based AGB measures were regressed to AGB
   values resulting from destructive methods to identify the measurement
   settings that show the best fit. Furthermore, 3D models of four mountain
   pasture plots were reconstructed in May, July, and August. Models
   relative to the same plot were aligned and their relative difference
   measured to produce a diachronic canopy variation model (DCVM). On the
   measured volume (V-d), the coefficient of density (c(rho)) was applied
   to adjust the volume values (V-adj) in relation to variation due to
   different DCVM point densities. The measurement setting for AGB volume
   estimations strongly influenced their correlation with traditional AGB
   scores. The best fit was obtained selecting 1 mm grid cell size and
   minimum point height distance. Such options were then selected to
   measure the DCVM. Adjusted volumes were fully correlated with the
   average point distance. Three plots revealed higher rates of AGB in the
   spring compared to summer season, as justified by the summer aridity
   constraints affecting vegetation productivity in Mediterranean areas. In
   one plot, we found an anomalous seasonal pattern, showing an AGB
   reduction in spring, which can be correlated with grazing, that promoted
   a subsequent increment in summer. Our study indicates that image-based
   photogrammetric techniques allow for reliable non-destructive
   measurements of surface biomass in diachronic analyses, offering a
   valuable tool for evaluating occurrence, magnitude, and spatial patterns
   of variations of community primary productivity over time. Diachronic
   canopy variation model produced congruent patterns of inter-seasonal
   canopy variations proving to be a useful tool for analyzing local
   disturbance to vegetation canopy caused by grazing.}},

Abstract = {{The shallow northern Adriatic Sea has a long history of anthropogenic
   impacts that reaches back many centuries. While the effects of
   eutrophication, overfishing, pollution, and trawling over recent decades
   have been extensively studied, the major ecological turnovers during the
   Holocene as a whole remain poorly explored. In this study, we
   reconstruct ecological baselines defining benthic ecosystem composition
   prior to major anthropogenic changes at four stations characterized by
   low sedimentation and millennial-scale time averaging of molluscan
   assemblages. We discriminate between natural and anthropogenic drivers
   based on (1) stratigraphic changes in the composition of molluscan
   communities observed in sediment cores and (2) changes in concentrations
   of heavy metals, pollutants, and organic enrichment. The four 1.5-m long
   sediment cores reach back to the Pleistocene-Holocene boundary, allowing
   for a stratigraphic distinction of the major sea-level phases of the
   Holocene. During the transgressive phase and maximum flooding, sea-level
   and establishment of the modern circulation pattern determined the
   development of benthic communities in shallow-water, vegetated habitats
   with epifaunal biostromes and, in deeper waters, with bryozoan meadows.
   After sea-level stabilization, the composition of these baseline
   communities remained relatively uniform and started to change markedly
   only with the intensification of human impacts in the late highstand,
   leading to a dominance of infauna and a decline of epifauna at all
   sites. This profound ecological change reduced species richness,
   increased the abundance of infaunal suspension feeders, and led to a
   decline of grazers and deposit feeders. We suggest that modern
   soft-bottom benthic communities in the northern Adriatic Sea today do
   not show the high geographic heterogeneity in composition characteristic
   of benthos prior to anthropogenic influences.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing is one of the major anthropogenic driving factors influencing
   community structure and ecological function of grasslands. Fencing has
   been proved to be one of the main measures for rehabilitating degraded
   grasslands in northwestern China. However, data from combined empirical
   studies on the effects of different management regimes in desert
   grasslands are lacking. So we selected long-term fencing (fenced since
   1991), mid-term fencing and seasonal fencing (fenced since 2002), and
   adjacent free-grazing grasslands to investigate vegetation and soil
   properties on southwest Mu Us desert. Our results showed that fencing
   increased plant cover, height, aboveground biomass (AGB) of different
   plant life-form groups, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Evenness index,
   Simpson index, total soil nitrogen, total soil phosphorus, and soil
   organic matter, but decreased plant density, species richness, Richness
   index, soil bulk density, water content, and pH. However, 22-24 years of
   long-term complete fencing might cause redegradation of vegetation and
   soil nutrients, characterized by the reduction of some vegetation
   properties, biodiversity, total AGB, and some soil properties. Seasonal
   fencing with 11-13 year was more beneficial to vegetation restoration
   than that with completely fencing measures. Our study suggests that
   appropriate artificial disturbances, such as seasonal fencing (winter
   grazing and summer fencing), should be used after long-term fencing in
   order to maintain grassland productivity and biodiversity. These
   findings will help to provide theoretical support for vegetation
   restoration and sustainable management in grassland under grazing
   prohibition at Mu Us desert.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3577-3587}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Simultaneous reductions in herbivore abundance and increases in nitrogen
   deposition have led to radical shifts in plant communities worldwide.
   While the individual impacts of these human-caused disturbances are
   apparent, few studies manipulate both herbivory and N, nor differentiate
   among herbivore guilds, to understand contingencies in the ability of
   these drivers to affect producer diversity and productivity. As such,
   understanding how the main and combined effects of increasing soil N
   with declining herbivores may influence plant community structure and
   function is critical to better understand the future of grassland
   ecosystems under multiple global change drivers. In this study, we
   asked: (a) What are the main effects of small mammal herbivores,
   invertebrate herbivores, and soil N on plant community structure and
   function? and (b) Are the effects of invertebrate herbivores and soil N
   on plant community structure and function contingent on small mammal
   herbivory? We used a nested design, with invertebrate and soil N
   treatments nested within small mammal manipulations in an existing
   tallgrass prairie. We measured plant community structure by quantifying
   plant richness, evenness, diversity, and composition across two full
   growing seasons. We also recorded total aboveground biomass to quantify
   grassland productivity. We found that small mammal herbivores strongly
   shaped plant diversity, species composition, and productivity. Small
   mammal herbivores also mediated the effects of soil N and invertebrate
   herbivores on grassland community structure, but not composition or
   productivity. Small mammal reduction lowered plant species richness
   while increasing aboveground biomass and altering compositional
   similarity. Invertebrate herbivores, in the presence of small mammals,
   promoted plant dominance by reducing evenness without altering
   compositional similarity. Additionally, soil nitrogen addition reduced
   plant richness, but only when small mammals were reduced, and no effects
   were detected on compositional similarity or productivity. Our findings
   provide further evidence that temperate grasslands can be strongly
   influenced by consumers, and that consumers mediate the effects of
   resources as well as other consumer guilds on producer evenness and
   richness. Taken together, we provide evidence of strong contingencies in
   the drivers of grassland structure, with small mammals directly altering
   plant diversity as well as mediating the effects of soil nitrogen and
   invertebrate herbivory on plant richness and evenness. Therefore, we
   suggest it is imperative to consider how consumer guilds and resource
   types may interact to shape grassland plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive understanding of the interactions between primary
   producers and consumers plays an important role for the conservation of
   sensitive ecosystems such as lagoons. In this light, we studied the
   relationships between the flocks' size of Mareca penelope and the
   distribution of three seagrass species (Cymodocea nodosa, Zoostera
   marina and Nanozostera noltei) occurring in the Marano and Grado lagoon
   (Northern Adriatic Sea). Twelve bird monitoring areas were monthly
   surveyed for 3 years whereas seagrass distribution data were collected
   for the whole lagoon in the following years. The overall number of
   individuals of M. penelope was related to seagrass meadow extension and
   species cover by using a multiscale approach in four circle buffers
   (with radius of 500, 750, 1,000 and 1,250m). Among the considered
   scales, the 750m radius scale showed the best performance. The overall
   number of M. penelope increased where the occupied area by seagrass
   meadows was larger. Results also showed that when C. nodosa mean
   percentage cover increased the number of M. penelope decreased, while if
   N. noltei mean percentage cover increased also M. penelope number
   increased. Z. marina showed a negligible influence for all the tested
   scales. Our findings demonstrate that M. penelope populations depend not
   only on the extension of seagrass meadows but also on their species
   assembly, evidencing that M. penelope seem to prefer N. noltei stands,
   avoiding meadows with high abundance of C. nodosa.}},

Abstract = {{While best practices for evaluating restoration ecology projects are
   emerging rapidly, budget constraints often limit postrestoration
   monitoring, which emphasizes the need for practical and efficient
   monitoring strategies. We examined the postrestoration outcome for an
   ENGO (Nature Conservancy of Canada) project, to assess retroactively how
   variation in intensity and frequency of sampling would have affected
   estimates of plant species composition, diversity, and richness over
   time. The project restored four habitat types (mesic forest, oak
   woodland, wet meadow, and sand barren) using sculptured seeding of
   tallgrass prairie and woody species. Species-level plant cover was
   monitored annually for 10 years in 168 2 x 2-m quadrats. We performed
   randomization tests to examine estimates of species diversity and
   richness as a function of the number of quadrats sampled, and assessed
   the necessity of annual sampling for describing changes in species
   composition and successional trajectories. The randomization tests
   revealed that sampling 10-17 quadrats, depending on habitat type, was
   sufficient to obtain estimates of species diversity that were at least
   95\% of values obtained from the whole dataset. Species richness as a
   function of number of quadrats sampled did not plateau, which suggests
   that rather than increasing the number of sampling quadrats, richness
   could be estimated more efficiently using nonquadrat based sampling
   techniques. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis revealed that
   plant species composition largely stabilized by 3-5 years
   postrestoration depending on habitat type. By that time, native, seeded
   species dominated the restoration, and the benefits of annual sampling
   for tracking changes in species composition diminished.}},

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem services (ES) are the direct and indirect contributions of
   ecosystems to human well-being. Grassland ecosystems cover >40\% of
   Earth's ice-free terrestrial surface, and grassland management affects
   the ES provided. Our objective was to synthesize the existing literature
   assessing management effects on regulating and supporting ES provided by
   grasslands, explore the related mechanisms, and determine which
   practices favor ES delivery. Current literature supports the following
   conclusions. Increasing management intensity of grasslands through
   planting more productive species or increasing fertilizer inputs
   generally increases soil organic C (SOC) accumulation. Increasing the
   number of plant species or functional groups, especially when legumes
   are added, often increases SOC accumulation. Grazed grasslands generally
   accumulate SOC more rapidly than undefoliated grasslands. Low or
   moderate stocking rates favor SOC accumulation relative to high stocking
   rates, especially in lower-rainfall environments. Short-term SOC
   accumulation rates observed after conversion of cropland to perennial
   grassland do not continue indefinitely. More digestible forages
   defoliated at optimal maturity may decrease CH4 emitted per unit of feed
   consumed or per unit of animal product. Substituting legumes for N
   fertilizer and reducing livestock N excretion through diet manipulation
   reduce N2O emissions. Managing grazing to increase uniformity of excreta
   deposition increases efficiency of nutrient cycling. Species-rich
   grasslands with flower-rich legumes and forbs increase foraging
   opportunities for pollinators. Finally, to optimize delivery of
   grassland ES, management practices that sustain ecosystem function
   likely need to replace those that maximize short-term resource
   utilization or economic return. To encourage adoption, such practices
   may need to be incentivized.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing availability of reactive nitrogen (N) threatens plant
   diversity in diverse ecosystems. While there is mounting evidence for
   the negative impacts of N deposition on one component of diversity,
   species richness, we know little about its effects on another one,
   species evenness. It is suspected that ecosystem management practice
   that removes nitrogen from the ecosystem, such as hay-harvesting by
   mowing in grasslands, would mitigate the negative impacts of N
   deposition on plant diversity. However, empirical evidence is scarce.
   Here, we reported the main and interactive effects of N deposition and
   mowing on plant diversity in a temperate meadow steppe with 4-year data
   from a field experiment within which multi-level N addition rates and
   multiple N compounds are considered. Across all the types of N
   compounds, species richness and evenness significantly decreased with
   the increases of N addition rate, which was mainly caused by the growth
   of a tall rhizomatous grass, Leymus chinensis. Such negative impacts of
   N addition were accumulating with time. Mowing significantly reduced the
   dominance of L. chinensis, and mitigated the negative impacts of N
   deposition on species evenness. We present robust evidence that N
   deposition threatened biodiversity by reducing both species richness and
   evenness, a process which could be alleviated by mowing. Our results
   highlight the changes of species evenness in driving the negative
   impacts of N deposition on plant diversity and the role of mowing in
   mediating such negative impacts of N deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Climate warming may cause alpine grassland degradation by decreasing
   plant growth and increasing pika grazing, although the concurrent
   precipitation change may further confound the plant and pika responses
   to warming. We aim to investigate the interactive effect of changes in
   temperature, precipitation and pika herbivory on plant growth. A 2-year
   field manipulation experiment of 2 degrees C warming and 15-30\%
   increased precipitation was conducted in an alpine grassland ecosystem.
   During the growing season, warming significantly reduced plant height
   growth of the two dominant species Stipa purpurea and Kobresia
   macrantha, whereas increased precipitation and its interactions with
   warming stimulated plant height growth. Regarding the widespread species
   S. purpurea, warming significantly increased the frequency, consumption,
   and intensity of pika herbivory, whereas increased precipitation
   significantly reduced pika herbivory intensity, resulting in a net
   positive effect of increased precipitation and its interactions with
   warming and pika herbivory on plant growth. However, the pika grazing on
   K. macrantha varied little with warming and precipitation change. There
   was generally a much larger effect of pika grazing on S. Purpurea than
   on K. macrantha, which corresponded to higher specific leaf area and
   nitrogen content in S. purpurea than in K. macrantha. The diet selection
   of pika may explain why the sensitivity of pika herbivory to warming and
   precipitation change differed between the two dominant plant species.
   Our data suggest that the effect of pika grazing on Stipa plants is
   amplified by climatic warming, and such a negative effect could be
   alleviated by increased precipitation.}},

Journal = {{LAND DEGRADATION \& DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{561-573}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are the predominant forage source for grazing animals and
   cover more of the Earth's land than any other major vegetation type.
   Their values are not always recognised, and conversion to other uses is
   continuing at a high rate leading to greater environmental and
   socio-economic problems. Overgrazing is one of the main drivers of
   productivity decline of grasslands, reflecting the pressures from
   excessive human populations and a demand for food. Some 20\% of the
   world's grasslands are in a severely degraded state; others have
   suffered shifts to less-desirable species. Biodiversity and greenhouse
   gas production have also been particular concerns. Estimates of
   productivity change all show a decline over recent decades, yet animal
   numbers continue to increase, particularly in the developing world. This
   paper critically reviews the projected demands for livestock products,
   driven largely by human population growth; the current health of the
   world's grasslands and how current livestock systems that depend on land
   conversion and overexploitation of grassland are inappropriate and need
   to be improved. Central to this argument is that small holders in the
   developing world will be responsible for a large amount of the future
   red meat production, and this can be achieved through more efficient
   livestock production systems using lower stocking rates. The Australian
   sheep industry is provided as an example of how livestock production and
   reduced environmental impacts can be achieved with improved efficiency.
   Changes will require smallholders to transition to a competitive,
   market-oriented livestock industry, which will provide challenges.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands are among the richest European ecosystems in
   terms of biodiversity. However, they have been severely affected by
   farming intensification and land abandonment, which have been both
   exacerbated by the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).
   The most recent CAP included a ``greening{''} measure dedicated to
   grassland conservation, presumed to be beneficial to biodiversity;
   however, scientific evidence about its effectiveness is still scarce. In
   the Alps, hay meadows have undergone dramatic management changes in
   recent decades. We used a comprehensive community ecology approach to
   highlight how the multi-scale and interacting effects of such changes
   impact birds, with the aim of providing knowledge to support
   improvements to the CAP. Birds were surveyed at 63 landscape units in
   northeast Italy, equally subdivided into areas dominated by (a)
   extensive hay meadows, (b) intensive hay meadows, and (c) areas formerly
   dominated by meadows but partially converted into other agricultural
   land use. This environmental gradient mirrors in space the temporal
   gradient of the agricultural changes that have recently occurred in the
   Alps. Community composition, species richness, and the number of
   meadow-specialist species were analysed according to environmental
   predictors (i.e. landscape, meadow management, and topography), and to
   spatial factors. We aimed to disentangle the exclusive and joint
   fraction of variation explained by each of them. Meadow conversion,
   allowed by the CAP in force, created a shift in community composition
   towards assemblages dominated by generalist species at the expense of
   meadow specialists. The cover of intensive meadows was negatively
   correlated with species richness, whereas the number of meadow
   specialists was negatively correlated with the cover of early-mown (i.e.
   within the third week of June) meadows. Mowing date was, in turn,
   related to elevation, with meadows at higher elevations mown later in
   the season, and to meadow intensification (the use of external inputs,
   in particular liquid manure, leads to earlier and more frequent cuts per
   year). Policy implications. Our study confirms the concerns about
   effectiveness of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy
   greening grassland measure in conserving biodiversity in those
   ecosystems. We suggest rethinking the Common Agricultural Policy
   environmental prescriptions to account for the importance of meadow
   management in determining bird diversity patterns in Alpine hay meadows.
   Finally, we highlight market-based conservation strategies as
   complementary approaches for preserving grassland biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation agriculture (CA) gained recently some visibility in the
   Mediterranean region. By affecting soil and plant ecology, CA is
   expected to influence other biological groups, notably farmland birds.
   This study aims to assess (1) the importance of tillage regime
   (conventional vs. no-tillage) and frequency of cultivation under these
   two regimes in determining the richness and abundance of birds in
   extensive grasslands originated within rotational cropping systems, and
   (2) how tillage systems contribute to changes in bird richness and
   abundance, comparatively to other drivers of bird ecology in
   Mediterranean farmland. We conducted bird censuses (point counts) from
   2012 to 2016 in 34-52 fields per year of 15 farms in Evora region
   (Southern Portugal). Generalized Linear Mixed Models were used to link
   bird abundance/richness with agricultural descriptors. Both tillage
   regime and cultivation frequency showed weak effects on Species richness
   and Total bird abundance. However, a strong variability in the response
   to tillage descriptors was found between species. For the little bustard
   and the Iberian grey shrike, a strong interaction with the annual
   weather regime and opposite trends for the effect of tillage regime were
   detected. Despite its moderate influence on bird assemblages
   comparatively to other major drivers of bird richness and abundance
   (i.e. grazing and annual weather regime), CA could constitute a
   potential complementary ``greening measure{''} to manage extensive
   grasslands within rotational cropping systems, particularly in areas
   where soil erosion is a problem, although some species may not benefit
   from its implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Intraspecific trait variation (ITV) is thought to play a significant
   role in community assembly, but the magnitude and direction of its
   influence are not well understood. Although it may be critical to better
   explain population persistence, species interactions, and therefore
   biodiversity patterns, manipulating ITV in experiments is challenging.
   We therefore incorporated ITV into a trait- and individual-based model
   of grassland community assembly by adding variation to the plants'
   functional traits, which then drive life-history tradeoffs. Varying the
   amount of ITV in the simulation, we examine its influence on
   pairwise-coexistence and then on the species diversity in communities of
   different initial sizes. We find that ITV increases the ability of the
   weakest species to invade most, but that this effect does not scale to
   the community level, where the primary effect of ITV is to increase the
   persistence and abundance of the competitively-average species.
   Diversity of the initial community is also of critical importance in
   determining ITV's efficacy; above a threshold of interspecific
   diversity, ITV does not increase diversity further. For communities
   below this threshold, ITV mainly helps to increase diversity in those
   communities that would otherwise be low-diversity. These findings
   suggest that ITV actively maintains diversity by helping the species on
   the margins of persistence, but mostly in habitats of relatively low
   alpha and beta diversity.}},

Title = {{Anaerobic digestion of wetland biomass from conservation management for
   biogas production}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we examined the biogas and methane production of wetland
   plants species harvested in the Narew River Valley protected as national
   park, NE Poland. In the experiment, we used the aboveground biomass of
   five species: reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), common reed
   (Phragmites australis), reed sweet-grass (Glyceria maxima), tufted sedge
   (Carex elata) and woollyfruit sedge (Carex lasiocarpa). The plants were
   harvested in three seasons of the year 2015: mid-summer, late summer,
   and early fall.
   The chemical composition of wetland plants was not beneficial for the
   anaerobic digestion, because of the sub-optimal C:N ratio. Consequently,
   the wetland species exhibited rather average methane production (102-221
   NL kg(-1) VS). These values were similar to that observed for grasses
   collected in extensive grasslands and wetlands by other researchers.
   They were, however, much lower than those obtained for species harvested
   in cultivated grasslands. Methane and gross energy yield differed
   significantly (p < 0.05) depending on the season of the biomass cut. The
   optimal period for the harvest of wetland biomass for biogas generation
   was the middle of summer, July-August.
   Phragmites australis appeared to be the most promising energy species.
   Despite the low methane yield per kg VS, common reed, due to its high
   aboveground biomass, achieved quite high methane production per area
   (1,16.10(6) NL CH4 ha(-1)). Our findings suggest that biomass of reed
   rushes can provide a substantial source of renewable energy used for
   biogas generation, which will make possible economic exploitation of
   wetlands combined with the conservation of their natural functions and
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Under extensive grazing, a mosaic pattern of frequently defoliated short
   patches and rarely defoliated tall patches is often formed. The
   agronomic and ecological consequences of this patch-grazing pattern
   strongly depend on its stability between successive years. We assessed
   patch structure and temporal stability under three intensities of cattle
   stocking (moderate, lenient and very lenient) in a cattle grazing
   experiment established in 2002. Aerial images of the whole area taken in
   2005, 2010, 2013 and 2015 were classified into short and tall patches
   using random forest classification. These were complemented by annual
   sward height measurements (2007-2017) at 10 permanent plots per paddock,
   which were classified into sward height classes. The mean proportion
   (0.72, 0.32, 0.19) and size of short patches decreased with stocking
   intensity, while size of tall patches increased. Inter-annual stability
   depended on patch type and stocking intensity and was particularly high
   for the respective dominant patch type. Of the short patch area in 2015,
   0.62, 0.29 and 0.30 were classified as short in all four aerial images
   under moderate, lenient and very lenient grazing, respectively; the
   corresponding proportions for tall patches were 0.10, 0.53 and 0.65. Our
   results imply that short and tall patches experience persistent
   differences in local grazing intensity over extended periods. The
   long-term effects of this heterogeneity on soil properties and
   vegetation composition need to be monitored to assess agronomic
   sustainability and ecological potential of patch-grazed pastures.}},

Title = {{Contingent factors explain average divergence in functional composition
   over 88 years of old field succession}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{545-558}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{``Old fields{''} are ecosystems that have been previously managed and
   subsequently abandoned, usually from agricultural use. These systems are
   classic testing grounds for hypotheses about community assembly.
   However, old field succession can be difficult to predict: seemingly
   similar fields often diverge in terms of species composition and
   environmental conditions. Here, we test the relative roles of
   contingency and stochasticity in driving vegetative successional
   dynamics. We draw on three decades of surveys in 24 old fields at the
   Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve (Minnesota, USA), and focus on
   five drivers that are known to shape local plant communities: soil
   fertility, fire, climate, competition, and demography. These drivers can
   contribute to contingency when they act consistently across fields and
   years (e.g., soil nitrogen accumulation, experimental fire regimes, or
   average climate), or to stochasticity when their effects are variable
   (e.g., annual variations in weather, or colonization and mortality
   events). We proceed in two steps. First, we fit regressions estimating
   abundance, colonization, and mortality for eight major functional groups
   in relation to these five drivers. We then use these regressions to
   parameterize a series of metacommunity simulation models, and test
   whether observed levels of stochasticity and variation in the drivers
   are sufficient to explain successional divergence. All drivers were
   significantly associated with plant species abundances, colonization,
   and mortality. Contingent factors strongly altered predicted
   successional trajectories. However, replicate simulations with similar
   conditions followed similar successional trajectories, suggesting that
   stochastic processes did not lead to divergence. This robustness of
   successional dynamics may be explained by compensatory trade-offs. For
   example, species that were abundant late in succession typically
   suffered from low colonization rates and high mortality rates early in
   succession. Synthesis. Average successional dynamics among old fields at
   Cedar Creek follow largely consistent trends. Though dynamics of
   individual fields vary, much of this variation can be explained by
   contingent factors. Stochastic processes appear not to be sufficiently
   strong to create divergent successional trajectories among fields with
   similar sets of drivers. Our results therefore suggest that divergence
   among successional trajectories in chronosequences may be the result of
   predictable contingent factors, rather than unpredictable stochastic
   fluctuations.}},

Title = {{Trends in fragmentation and connectivity of Paspalum quadrifarium
   grasslands in the Buenos Aires province, Argentina}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Background. Despite its wide distribution worldwide, only 4.6\% of
   temperate grasslands are included within systems of protected areas. In
   Argentina, this situation is even more alarming: only 1.05\% is
   protected. The study area (central area of the southern Salado River
   basin) has a large extent of grasslands of Paspalum quadrifarium (Pq)
   which has been target since the middle of the last century of a variety
   of agricultural management practices including fire burning for cattle
   grazing.
   Methods. Five binary images of presence-absence data of Pq from a
   42-year range (1974-2016) derived from a land cover change study were
   used as base data. Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA),
   Morphological Change Detection (MCD) and Network Connectivity Analysis
   (NCA) were performed to the data using Guidos Toolbox (GTB) for the
   estimation of habitat and connectivity dynamics of the Pq patches
   (fragments).
   Results. A loss of the coverage area and habitat nuclei of this
   grassland was observed during the study period, with some temporal
   oscillation but no recovery to initial states. Additional drastic
   reduction in connectivity was also evident in resulting maps. The number
   of large Pq grassland fragments (>50 ha) decreased at beginning of the
   study period. Also, fragmentation measured as number of components
   (patches) was higher at the end of the study period. The Pq pajonal
   nuclei had their minimum representativeness in 2000, and recovered
   slightly in area in 2011, but with a significant percentage increase of
   smaller patches (=islets) and linear elements as bridges and branches.
   Large corridors (mainly edge of roads) could be observed at the end of
   the study period, while the total connectivity of the landscape pattern
   drops continuously. Statistics of links shows mean values decreasing
   from 1974 to 2016. On the other hand, maximum values of links decreased
   up to 19\% in 2011, and recovered to a 54\% of their original value in
   2016.
   Discussion. Pq fragmentation and habitat reduction could have an impact
   on the ecosystem functioning and the mobility of some species of native
   fauna. The connecting elements of the landscape were maintained and/or
   recovered in percentage in 2011 and 2016. This fact, although favoring
   the dispersion of the present diversity in the habitat nuclei could
   cause degradation by an edge effect. Part of the area has the potential
   to be taken as an area of research and as an example of livestock
   management, since it is the one that would most preserve the
   biodiversity of the Pq environment. On the methodological side, the use
   of a proved tool as GTB is useful for monitoring dynamics of a
   grassland-habitat fragmentation.}},

Title = {{Grazing exclosures solely are not the best methods for sustaining alpine
   grasslands}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{Background. Grazing is widely regarded as a critical factor affecting
   the vegetation structure, productivity and nutritional value of natural
   grasslands. To protect and restore degraded grasslands, non-grazed
   exclosures are considered as a valuable tool. However, it is not clear
   whether long term non-grazed exclosures of grazers can improve the
   condition and nutritional value of vegetation and soil properties.
   Methods. We have compared the impact of long-term non-grazed and
   continuous grazed management strategy on vegetation structure,
   nutritional values and soil properties of alpine meadow of the
   Qinghai-Tibet Plateau by field investigation (11-13 years) and indoor
   analysis during 2015-2017.
   Results. Our results showed that long-term non-grazed exclosures clearly
   increased the aboveground biomass and coverage of plant functional
   types. Long-term non-grazed exclosures improved the development of all
   vegetation types, except NG (GG, grass species type; SG, sedge species
   type; LG, leguminous species type; FG, forbs species type and NG,
   noxious species type). Long-term non-grazed exclosures significantly
   improved all six measured soil properties (TN, total nitrogen; TP, total
   phosphorus; TK, total potassium; AN, available nitrogen; AP, available
   phosphorus and AK, available potassium) in 0-10 cm soil layer,
   considerable effect on the improvement of all measured soil properties,
   except TK in 10-20 cm soil layer and all measured soil properties,
   except TN and TK in 20-30 cm soil layer were observed. However,
   long-term non-grazed exclosures significantly decreased biodiversity
   indicators i.e., species richness, Shannon diversity index and Evenness
   index of vegetation. A substantial decrease in the density, biodiversity
   and nutritional values (CP (crude protein), IVTD (in vitro ture
   digestibility) and NDF (neutral detergent fiber)) of all vegetation
   types, except NG were recorded. While a downward trend in aboveground
   biomass and all measured soil properties except TP and TK were observed
   during 2015-2017 in alpine meadows due to long-term grazed treatment.
   The density, diversity and nutritional value (CP and IVTD) of long-term
   non-grazed alpine meadows showed a downward trend over time (2015-2017).
   By considering the biodiversity conservation and grassland livestock
   production, long-term non-grazed exclosures are not beneficial for the
   improvement of density, biodiversity and nutritional values of plant
   functional types. Thus, our study suggests that rotational non-grazed
   and grazed treatment would be a good management strategy to restore and
   improve the biodiversity and nutritional values of plant functional
   types in natural grassland ecosystems.}},

   frequency were analysed by multivariate and univariate methods in
   relation to environmental variables and modelled climate and groundwater
   data. Mowing resulted in a decline in shrub and Molinia caerulea cover
   at the continental and oceanic sites respectively, and the total cover
   of specialist fen species had increased to a significantly greater
   extent in the mown plots than the unmown at the continental site.
   However, mowing did not have an effect on the cover of specialist
   bryophyte species, and some specialist species declined regardless of
   mowing treatment. Temperature sums had increased at both sites, but
   precipitation had not changed significantly. Mowing was shown to be the
   most important determinant of plant community composition at both sites,
   with local environmental conditions being of secondary importance. In
   conclusion, the abandonment of traditional management practices results
   in the loss of characteristic fen species. In order to encourage the
   restoration of typical rich-fen vegetation, particularly in oceanic
   areas, additional management measures, such as more intensive mowing,
   may be required.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that rangelands lose productivity and ecosystem
   function under excessive rates of livestock stocking, however the role
   of the spatio-temporal distribution of grazing density remains debated.
   Multiple studies show that managing grazing for high livestock density
   has little effect on plant and livestock productivity, yet fewer explore
   animal behaviour as a mechanism that would explain these observations.
   We hypothesised that increasing cattle grazing densities under
   equivalent stocking rates will cause animals to concentrate more, spend
   more time grazing and thereby increase utilisation of forage, and reduce
   selection for palatable vegetation patches and species. We compared
   season-long grazing (SLG), four-camp grazing (FCG) and holistic planned
   grazing (HPG) over three years in an experimental trial in a mesic
   grassland of South Africa reflecting a range of grazing densities (SLG <
   FCG < HPG). We measured the spatio-temporal patterns of cattle
   behaviour, dietary composition, dung trampling, animal productivity, and
   normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). The management approach
   did not change the time allocated to different animal behaviours,
   trampling of dung, nor the selection for particular plants. HPG cattle
   grazed at closer distances to one another than SLG but not FCG, and
   herds were equally concentrated when resting and walking. HPG cattle
   spent less time in patches of high vegetation NDVI compared to SLG,
   thereby reducing the spatial heterogeneity of NDVI over time. Cattle
   gained 0.2 +/- 0.02 kg day(-1) ha(-1), and this did not differ between
   management approaches. The HPG approach is costly to set up and is
   predicted to take twice as long as FCG and SLG to become profitable.
   Depending on the management goal, HPG could reduce selection for
   palatable patches, possibly preventing overgrazing and formation of bare
   patches over the long term. Alternatively, SLG could increase selection
   for palatable patches and initiate the formation of grazing lawns and,
   in combination with fire, commonly used in FCG, might enhance
   biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Dynamic multi-species occupancy models reveal individualistic habitat
   preferences in a high-altitude grassland bird community}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Moist, high-altitude grasslands of eastern South African harbour rich
   avian diversity and endemism. This area is also threatened by
   increasingly intensive agriculture and land conversion for energy
   production. This conflict is particularly evident at Ingula, an
   Important Bird and Biodiversity Area located within the least conserved
   highaltitude grasslands and which is also the site of a new Pumped
   Storage Scheme. The new management seeks to maximise biodiversity
   through manipulation of the key habitat variables: grass height and
   grass cover through burning and grazing to make habitat suitable for
   birds. However, different species have individual habitat preferences,
   which further vary through the season. We used a dynamic multi-species
   occupancy model to examine the seasonal occupancy dynamics of 12 common
   grassland bird species and their habitat preferences. We estimated
   monthly occupancy, colonisation and persistence in relation to grass
   height and grass cover throughout the summer breeding season of 2011/12.
   For majority of these species, at the beginning of the season occupancy
   increased with increasing grass height and decreased with increasing
   grass cover. Persistence and colonisation decreased with increasing
   grass height and cover. However, the 12 species varied considerably in
   their responses to grass height and cover. Our results suggest that
   management should aim to provide plots which vary in grass height and
   cover to maximise bird diversity. We also conclude that the decreasing
   occupancy with increasing grass cover and low colonisation with
   increasing grass height and cover is a results of little grazing on our
   study site. We further conclude that some of the 12 selected species are
   good indicators of habitat suitability more generally because they
   represent a range of habitat needs and are relatively easy to monitor.}},

Title = {{Tree diversity in a human modified riparian forest landscape in
   semi-arid Kenya}},

Volume = {{433}},
Pages = {{645-655}},

Abstract = {{Riparian forests in tropical drylands support high biodiversity and
   provide crucial ecosystem services. Yet, fertile soil, water
   availability and trees as a source of charcoal and timber make them a
   favourable place for settlements and subsistence agriculture. The
   present study aimed at evaluating the floristic diversity of riparian
   forest remnants in semi-arid Kenya as a basis for developing
   conservation and management strategies. Plant diversity was assessed
   along the Nzeeu and Kalundu rivers in Kitui County, Eastern Province,
   where riparian forest patches were intermingled with agricultural and
   grazing lands and invasive thickets dominated by Lantana camara.
   Diameter at breast height (DBH) and height of woody species (DBH > 5 cm)
   were recorded in a total of 74 transects (50 m x 10 m) laid out
   perpendicular to the rivers on both sides at 300 m intervals. In each
   transect, the distribution of six land cover types was mapped out and
   the distance of each plant individual from the river bank was noted.
   Overall, 631 individuals were recorded representing 85 woody species, of
   which 12 were exotic timber and fruit trees. Human activities mostly
   reached within 10 m of the river margin; indigenous vegetation covered
   only 12\% of the transect area but had 188 tree individuals and 49 tree
   species (including 3 exotics), whereas agricultural land had a mean
   cover of 52\%, 168 individuals and 39 species, including 9 exotics.
   Ordination and multi-level pattern analysis showed that Euphorbia
   bicompacta Bruyns, endemic to Kenya, and Commiphora samharensis
   Schweinf. were characteristic of indigenous vegetation, whereas Acacia
   species dominated in invasive thicket, grazing land and agricultural
   land. Only two species, Shirakiopsis elliptica (Hochst.) Esser and
   Rauvolfia caffra Sond., were clearly associated with the river bank,
   while the others represented a mix of riparian species with a broader
   ecological amplitude and typical dryland species. The study highlights
   that the area still supports viable remnants of indigenous riparian
   vegetation, whereas tree diversity on agricultural land is strongly
   shaped by human preferences and shows lack of recruitment. Targeted
   management interventions could support the maintenance of indigenous
   tree diversity with positive effects for overall biodiversity, soil
   protection and livelihood diversification. For instance, it is
   recommended to facilitate natural tree regeneration and to plant a
   variety of indigenous tree species, especially on the river banks.
   Further research is necessary to assess the status of riparian
   vegetation along similar dryland rivers in Kenya and Africa to
   adequately manage these important areas for biodiversity and ecosystem
   services.}},

Abstract = {{Urban areas host several threatened species in small reserves that face
   habitat loss and fragmentation due to land-use change. Despite
   historical and current disturbances, these areas sometimes still
   maintain high biological diversity. As only 5\% of the European Union
   territory was classified as natural, the permanent grasslands represent
   overriding value, especially in metropolitan areas. Our aim was to
   explore protected and adventive plant species in a small and valuable,
   but till now, not deeply studied area of the densely inhabited 12th
   district in the metropolitan city Budapest (Hungary), which is visited
   by large numbers of people. We compared various historical map sources
   in order to explain how the extension of the grasslands has changed
   during the past centuries and, thus, which patches are permanent
   grassland habitats. We found 29 protected and 1 strictly protected plant
   species. The highest number of protected plant species and their stands
   were found in the permanent grasslands. Besides urbanisation, a heavy
   load of tourism (especially on non-designated routes), off-road mountain
   biking, airsoft races, some illegal shelters for homeless people and
   game damage threaten this unique refuge of high natural values. The
   extension of grasslands between 1783 and 2016 varies from 6.7 ha to 21.5
   ha. Their area constantly increased due to deforestation until 1867 and
   exceeded 20 ha, probably due to the mass increase in livestock grazing;
   then it stagnated until the 1920s, with a slight decrease due to
   expanding urban areas. Golf greens appeared, walker and skiing tourism
   increased and these apparently have not decreased the coverage of
   grasslands, but surely affected the composition of their species. Recent
   scrub encroachment and re-forestation caused a further decrease. Our
   distribution maps show the highest density of protected plant species on
   the southern slopes (2.4 hectare) that have constantly been grasslands
   since 1783 to date. Contrarily, the cutting of grasslands from 1861 to
   date contains only half of their number per area unit. Thus, the number
   of valuable plant specimens refers to the age of the grassland. Three
   species occur only in the oldest grasslands. Conservation actions should
   first and foremost focus on these patches.}},

Title = {{A Multi-Kingdom Study Reveals the Plasticity of the Rumen Microbiota in
   Response to a Shift From Non-grazing to Grazing Diets in Sheep}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 11}},
Abstract = {{Increasing feed efficiency is a key target in ruminant science which
   requires a better understanding of rumen microbiota. This study
   investigated the effect of a shift from a non-grazing to a grazing diet
   on the rumen bacterial, methanogenic archaea, fungal, and protozoal
   communities. A systems biology approach based on a description of the
   community structure, core microbiota, network analysis, and taxon
   abundance linked to the rumen fermentation was used to explore the
   benefits of increasing depth of the community analysis. A total of 24
   sheep were fed ryegrass hay supplemented with concentrate (CON) and
   subsequently ryegrass pasture (PAS) following a straight through
   experimental design. Results showed that concentrate supplementation in
   CON-fed animals (mainly starch) promoted a simplified rumen microbiota
   in terms of network density and bacterial, methanogen and fungal species
   richness which favored the proliferation of amylolytic microbes and VFA
   production (+48\%), but led to a lower (ca. 4-fold) ammonia
   concentration making the N availability a limiting factor certain
   microbes. The adaptation process from the CON to the PAS diet consisted
   on an increase in the microbial concentration (biomass of bacteria,
   methanogens, and protozoa), diversity (+221, +3, and +21 OTUs for
   bacteria, methanogens, and fungi, respectively), microbial network
   complexity (+18 nodes and +86 edges) and in the abundance of key
   microbes involved in cellulolysis (Ruminococcus, Butyrivibrio, and
   Orpinomyces), proteolysis (Prevotella and Entodiniinae), lactate
   production (Streptococcus and Selenomonas), as well as methylotrophic
   archaea (Methanomassiliicoccaceae). This microbial adaptation indicated
   that pasture degradation is a complex process which requires a diverse
   consortium of microbes working together. The correlations between the
   abundance of microbial taxa and rumen fermentation parameters were not
   consistent across diets suggesting a metabolic plasticity which allowed
   microbes to adapt to different substrates and to shift their
   fermentation products. The core microbiota was composed of 34, 9, and 13
   genera for bacteria, methanogens, and fungi, respectively, which were
   shared by all sheep, independent of diet. This systems biology approach
   adds a new dimension to our understanding of the rumen microbial
   interactions and may provide new clues to describe the mode of action of
   future nutritional interventions.}},

   Although considerable efforts have been devoted to understanding the
   responses of plant productivity and community composition to nitrogen
   (N) and phosphorus (P) enrichment, the nutrient enrichment effects on
   soil organic carbon (SOC) and microbial functions are not well
   understood. A four-year field experiment was established to evaluate the
   influence of continuous N and P enrichment on plant growth and SOC
   content in an alpine grassland of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The study
   included four treatments: Control without addition, N addition, P
   addition, and N plus P addition. N addition strongly increased
   aboveground plant biomass and decreased species richness by promoting
   growth of the dominant grasses species. In contrast, N and P enrichment
   significantly decreased SOC, especially the recalcitrant organic C
   content in the surface layer (0-10 cm) by reducing the slow C pool and
   enlarging the active C pool. Microbial biomass and activities of
   C-degrading enzymes (beta-glucosidase, cellulase and polyphenol oxidase)
   and an N-degrading enzyme (chitinase) increased with nutrient inputs.
   The CO2 emissions during a 300 d incubation period were positively
   correlated with the cellulase and chitinase activities, while the slow C
   pool was negatively correlated with the cellulase and polyphenol oxidase
   activities. Consequently, N and P enrichment accelerated decomposition
   of the recalcitrant C by stimulating microbial growth and increasing
   enzyme activities, leading to negative impacts on soil C sequestration.
   Overall, the results indicate that alpine grassland soils of the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau may be changing from a C sink to a C source
   under increasing N and P availability, and improvement of alpine
   grassland management through nutrient inputs should consider not only
   the aboveground biomass for grazing, but also the soil C sequestration
   and ecosystem functioning. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundPlants grow in multi-species communities rather than
   monocultures. Yet most studies on the emission of volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs) from plants in response to insect herbivore feeding
   focus on one plant species. Whether the presence and identity of
   neighboring plants or plant community attributes, such as plant species
   richness and plant species composition, affect the herbivore-induced VOC
   emission of a focal plant is poorly understood.MethodsWe established
   experimental plant communities in pots in the greenhouse where the focal
   plant species, red clover (Trifolium pratense), was grown in
   monoculture, in a two species mixture together with Geranium pratense or
   Dactylis glomerata, or in a mixture of all three species. We measured
   VOC emission of the focal plant and the entire plant community, with and
   without herbivory of Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars caged on one red
   clover individual within the communities.ResultsHerbivory increased VOC
   emission from red clover, and increasing plant species richness changed
   emissions of red clover and also from the entire plant community.
   Neighbor identity strongly affected red clover emission, with highest
   emission rates for plants growing together with D.
   glomerata.ConclusionThe results from this study indicate that the blend
   of VOCs perceived by host searching insects can be affected by
   plant-plant interactions.}},

Title = {{Multi-Scale Phenology of Temperate Grasslands: Improving Monitoring and
   Management With Near-Surface Phenocams}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Grasslands of the Australian Southern Tablelands represent a patchwork
   of native and exotic systems, occupying a continuum of C-3-dominated to
   C-4-dominated grasslands where composition depends on disturbance
   factors (e.g., grazing) and climate. Managing these complex landscapes
   is both challenging and critical for maintaining the security of
   Australia's pasture industries, and for protecting the biodiversity of
   native remnants. Differentiating C-3 from C-4 vegetation has been a
   prominent theme in remote sensing research due to distinct C-3/C-4
   seasonal productivity patterns (phenology) and high uncertainty about
   how C-3/C-4 vegetation will respond to a changing climate. Phenology is
   used in northern hemisphere ecosystems for a range of purposes but has
   not been widely adopted in Australia, where dynamic climate often
   results in non-repetitive seasonal vegetation patterns. We employed
   time-lapse cameras (phenocams) to study the phenology of twelve
   grassland areas dominated by cool season (C-3) and warm season (C-4),
   native or exotic grasses near Canberra, Australia. Our aims were to
   assess phenological characteristics of the functional types and to
   determine the drivers of phenological variability. We compared the
   fine-scale phenocam seasonal profiles with field sampling and
   MODIS/Landsat satellite products to assess paddock-to-landscape
   functioning. We found C-3/C-4 species dominance to be the primary driver
   of phenological differences among grassland types, with C-3 grasslands
   demonstrating peak greenness in spring, and senescing rapidly in
   response to high summer temperatures. In contrast, C-4 grasslands showed
   peak activity in Austral summer and autumn (January-March). Some sites
   displayed primary and secondary peaks dependent on rainfall and species
   composition. We found that the proportion of dead vegetation is an
   important biophysical driver of grassland phenology, as were grazing
   pressures and species-dependent responses to rainfall and temperature.
   The satellite and field datasets were in general agreement with the
   phenocam results. However, the higher temporal fidelity of the cameras
   captured changes in vegetation not observed in the coarser satellite or
   field results. Our phenocam data shows consistent periods of increasing
   and decreasing greenness over as little as 5 days. Applications for
   management of grasslands in temperate Australia include the
   identification of remnant native grasslands, tracking biosecurity
   issues, and assessing productivity responses to climate variability.}},

Title = {{Land-use components, abundance of predatory arthropods, and vegetation
   height affect predation rates in grasslands}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{270}},
Pages = {{84-92}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Land use is a major driver of biodiversity loss in many taxa including
   the mega-diverse arthropods, but consequences for arthropod-mediated
   processes are still little understood. Using a rapid ecosystem function
   assessment (REFA), we approximated predation by quantifying predation
   attempts on artificial sentinel prey. Dummies were placed on the soil
   surface of 83 managed temperate grasslands across a broad range of
   land-use intensities (grazing intensity, mowing frequency, and the
   amount of applied fertiliser) in two regions of Germany. Additionally,
   we measured vegetation height and assessed the abundance of
   ground-dwelling arthropods using pitfall traps. We documented predation
   marks left by arthropods, rodents, and birds. The proportion of dummies
   with predation marks (i.e. predation rates) differed between regions.
   Vegetation height was the strongest predictor for predation in our study
   but correlated only weakly with land use. Predation rates increased with
   increasing vegetation height, for rodents and for all predator groups
   combined. All three land-use components affected predation, which was
   most prominent for arthropod predation. Arthropod predation increased
   with higher grazing intensity and decreased with higher mowing frequency
   and higher fertilisation intensity. Also, the abundances of
   ground-dwelling arthropods affected predation. While predation rates
   generally increased with a higher abundance of carabids and decreased
   with higher abundance of ants, the effects of spider abundance
   interacted with region. Our results demonstrate that different
   components of land use can have counteracting effects on predation rates
   acting together with changes in the abundance of different predator
   groups and vegetation height. This suggests that land-use practices that
   sustain high vegetation and ground-dwelling predator abundances increase
   predation rates in grasslands and consequently the potential to provide
   ecosystem services in the form of pest control.}},

Title = {{Indicators for assessing tropical alpine rehabilitation practices}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of indicators for
   rehabilitation practices in high mountain landscapes that were aimed at
   increasing grassland palatability and biomass accumulation. Focusing on
   the department of Huancavelica in Peru, the importance of rehabilitation
   practiced in this area involves the relationship of alpaca pastoralists
   and their need to produce wool. Overgrazing in this area has decreased
   the carrying capacity of the system, which may be problematic for
   continuing their present levels of grazing. Therefore, rehabilitation
   practices, including herbivory exclusion, exclusion with added
   irrigation, and exclusion with water collecting ditches, were installed
   to increase vegetation biomass and palatability of the vegetation. The
   effects of the rehabilitation practices were assessed using six
   indicators: vegetation coverage, species richness, Shannon-Weiner
   Diversity Index, below and aboveground biomass, and soil organic matter,
   which were analyzed using mixed-effects models. The indicators show that
   some practices, such as exclusion and ditches, are positively affecting
   vegetation coverage while negatively affecting species richness.
   Additionally, biomass showed lower accumulation in areas not excluded
   from grazing. Therefore, although some of the treatments were initiated
   as recently as 2013, we can already observe changes in the indicators
   involving vegetation composition and structure. In the long term, these
   indicators may allow us to fully understand the effect of the
   rehabilitation practices on maintaining the carrying capacity of the
   system. Furthermore, the general approach should be widely applicable in
   other utilized landscapes.}},

   fallows, corresponding to CAP greening measures, on open farmland bird
   diversity, whilst controlling for the effects of distance to forests,
   field edge density and proportion of built-up areas.MethodsWe surveyed
   open farmland birds using territory mapping in Southern Finland. We
   modelled effects of greening measures and landscape structure on
   farmland birds (7642 territories) using generalised linear mixed
   models.ResultsIncreasing proportions of grasslands increased farmland
   bird species richness and diversity in open farmland, whereas increasing
   proportions of fallows increased bird diversity. Increasing crop
   diversity benefited individual species, but not species richness or
   diversity. Increasing field edge densities consistently increased the
   species richness of all farmland species, in-field nesters and non-crop
   nesters, as well as total farmland bird diversity. The relative effect
   of edge density was much stronger compared to the three greening
   measures.ConclusionsOur results show that promoting fallows and
   grasslands, in particular grazed grasslands and various types of
   semi-natural grasslands, has the highest potential to benefit farmland
   bird diversity. Maintaining or increasing field edge densities,
   currently not supported, seems to be of even more benefit. In open
   farmland, with little or no field edges, fallows and grasslands are
   particularly beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change predominated by warming over the past decades has
   affected plant biodiversity, distribution, and ecosystem functioning in
   alpine grasslands. Yet, little is known about the interactive effect of
   climate change and grazing on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.
   Here, we conducted a vegetation translocation experiment (ten
   soil-vegetation blocks were translocated from high-altitudinal site
   3,245m to low-altitudinal site 3,045m) combined with grazing treatment
   in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that (a)
   translocation induced effect of climate change from harsh,
   high-altitudinal site to benign, low-altitudinal site significantly
   promoted species richness, and density of asexual and sexual seedling,
   with an increase in the proportion of asexual recruitment to sexual
   recruitment; (b) grazing decreased the proportion of asexual seedling to
   sexual recruitment within community, led to a shift in the dominant
   plant functional groups from graminoids and legumes to forbs; and (c)
   grazing partly offset the increased species richness of seedling, but
   not seedling density, induced by climate change. These findings suggest
   that moderate grazing may buffer the effect of climate change on the
   plant community composition, and thus, functional role in alpine
   meadows. Further understanding the influence of climate change on
   grassland ecosystems needs to consider the non-additive effect of
   grazing and climate change to sustainability of grassland services.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in grassland vegetation structure influences the habitat
   selection of insectivorous birds. This variation presents a trade-off
   for insectivorous predators: Arthropod abundance increases with
   vegetation height and heterogeneity, but access to arthropod prey items
   decreases. In contrast, grazing by large herbivores reduces and
   homogenizes vegetation, decreasing total arthropod abundance and
   diversity. However, the presence of livestock dung may help counteract
   the overall reduction in invertebrates by increasing arthropods
   associated with dung. It is unclear, however, how the presence of
   arthropod prey in dung contributes to overall habitat selection for
   insectivorous birds or how dung-associated arthropods affect trade-offs
   between vegetation structure, arthropod abundance, and access to prey.
   To explore these relationships, we studied habitat selection of the
   Black-necked Crane (Grus nigricollis), a large omnivorous bird that
   breeds on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. We assessed the relationships
   between habitat selection of cranes and vegetation structure, arthropod
   abundance, and the presence of yak dung. We found that Black-necked
   Cranes disproportionately foraged in grassland patches with short sward
   height, low sward height heterogeneity, and high numbers of dry yak
   dung, despite these habitats having lower total arthropod abundance.
   Although total arthropod abundance is lower, these habitats are
   supplemented with dry yak dung, which are associated with coleopteran
   larvae, making dung pats an indicator of food resources for breeding
   Black-necked Cranes. Coleopteran adults and larvae in yak dung appear to
   be an important factor influencing the habitat selection of Black-necked
   Cranes and should be considered when assessing grassland foraging
   trade-offs of insectivorous birds. This research provides new insights
   into the role of livestock dung in defining foraging habitats and
   resources for insectivorous predators.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Grasslands are dominant vegetation of China, support outstanding
   biodiversity and sequester bulk amount of atmospheric CO2. These
   grasslands are highly degraded and fragmented due to remarkable
   anthropogenic and grazing loads. Chinese Government has made great
   attempt to restore by grazing exclusion. The relations of carbon fluxes
   with species composition and diversity in the communities sensitive to
   grazing by large herbivores are needed to be analysed under the global
   climate change scenario. The objective of present study was to
   comprehend the effects of grazing and fencing on the ecosystem structure
   and function of the typical steppe grassland.
   Methods To meet the objectives, overgrazed and fenced (since year 2001)
   systems were selected in typical steppe grassland at the Duolun
   Restoration Ecology Research Station, Inner Mogolia, China. Within each
   system, three dominant communities with three replicates were selected.
   In each replicate community, three 1 x 1 m plots, were randomly located.
   Each plot was divided into four 50 x 50 cm quadrats. A total of 216, 50
   x 50 cm quadrats were sampled. From each quadrat, number of individuals
   and above-ground herbaceous biomass for each species, soil respiration
   (SR), ecosystem respiration (ER), net (NEE) as well as gross (GEE)
   ecosystem CO2 exchanges were recorded in June 2015. Data were well
   analysed using statistical software. Canonical correspondence analysis
   showed differential responses of communities to the structure and
   function of the typical steppe grassland.
   Important Findings Across the communities, fencing reduced the soil
   temperature by 12\% and at the same time increased the soil moisture by
   44.30\%, thus, increased the species richness by 28\%, evenness by 21\%,
   above-ground biomass by 19\% and plant carbon by 20\%. Interestingly,
   fencing increased NEE by 128\%, GEE by 77\%, SR by 65\% and ER by 39\%.
   Under fencing, species composition partially governed the CO2 exchange
   processes.
   Conclusions Fencing reduces soil temperature and thereby improves
   species diversity and more efficient CO2 sequestration and long-term and
   in-depth study is desirable for a better understanding of the
   relationship between species diversity and ecosystem carbon uptake.}},

Abstract = {{In southern Europe, an intensive agricultural abandonment occurs for
   more than a century. This change in land use concerns both farming and
   breeding and induces a large-scale expansion of forest habitats. In the
   Mediterranean region, which is a centre of endemism and species richness
   for many groups, a large amount of biodiversity is related to ancient
   agricultural practices. This current abandonment could consequently
   induce a drastic flora and fauna impoverishment. This study attempts to
   identify the consequences of the widespread Mediterranean forest
   expansion on dung beetle assemblages. Dung beetle assemblages were
   monitored monthly with dung-baited pitfall trapping in four
   Mediterranean sites from 250 to 2030m in elevation. At each site,
   different grazed habitats (grassland, forest and shrubland or wooded
   grassland) were sampled during the most seasonally active period. In
   total, 61,645 specimens consisting of 70 species, namely 65 Scarabaeidae
   (42 Aphodiinae, 23 Scarabaeinae) and 5 Geotrupidae. Sixty-four out of
   the 70 sampled species (91.43\%) were widely distributed in the
   Palaearctic region. A drastic loss in species richness consecutive to
   the replacement of grassland by forest was observed all along the
   elevation gradient: 63 species recorded in grassland habitat versus 60
   and 45 species in shrubland and forest, respectively. There was often a
   loss in species richness according to elevation: 45 versus 30 species in
   low and high elevation, respectively. For Aphodiinae, the extension of
   forest also induced a shift in distribution across elevation. This
   important biodiversity loss that is mainly concerned with lowland
   thermophilous species was accompanied by crucial changes in the
   structure of assemblages. The measurement of alpha and beta-diversity in
   different habitats as well as between habitats across an elevation
   gradient is essential to our understanding of which habitats are
   required to best conserve biodiversity. Alpha diversity decreased from
   grassland to shrubland to forest. Intra-habitat alpha and beta-diversity
   decreased with elevation. Whereas, inter-habitat beta-diversity (spatial
   turnover) increased from grassland to shrubland and then to forest
   regardless of elevation. The contrarily, intra-site beta-diversity
   increased with elevation. Thus, at the regional scale, the spatial
   turnover decreased with elevation and increased with the vegetation
   cover. So, the composition and structure of dung beetle assemblages were
   affected by vegetation cover, which causes a decreasing abundance and
   species richness and could result in a drastic loss of dung beetles
   biodiversity in southern Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Rangeland management strategies impact biodiversity, the quality and
   quantity of ecosystem services, and overall rangeland resiliency.
   Previous management strategies, coupled with climate change, have led to
   widespread invasion by Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis; bluegrass) in
   the Northern Great Plains, United States. Bluegrass invasions are
   expected to have detrimental impacts on biodiversity conservation and
   ecosystem services provided by rangelands. Yet none have investigated
   how bluegrass invasions influence pollinator populations, which are a
   prominent conservation concern and provide ecosystem services. We
   measured the impact of bluegrass invasion on mixed-grass prairie forb
   and butterfly communities. Obligate grassland butterflies, those that
   rely on grasslands, decreased as bluegrass cover increased, including
   the threatened 1 lesperia dacotae. Conversely, the abundance of
   facultative grassland butterflies, those found in grasslands but not
   fully dependent on them for their life history, increased as bluegrass
   increased. Moreover, plant species diversity and flowering forb species
   richness decreased as bluegrass cover increased. Overall, bluegrass
   invasion led to butterfly and plant community simplification, signaling
   a loss of biodiversity and potentially ecosystem services. Our research
   is the first to quantify how grassland butterflies and the floral
   resources they depend on are negatively impacted by bluegrass invasion.
   Resource managers should adopt management strategies that reduce
   bluegrass cover and improve nectar and host resources for obligate
   grassland butterflies. Management choices that removed disturbance
   regimes inherent to the Northern Great Plains (i.e., fire and grazing)
   led to bluegrass dominance in the region. Therefore, restoring
   disturbance regimes may be one way to reduce bluegrass and benefit
   pollinator populations. (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management.

   low-quality litter species Kobresia Elymus nutans, and Ligularia
   virgaurea and high-quality litter species Anemone rivularis, Saussurea
   nigrescens, and Thermopsis lanceolata. Litter bags containing each
   species alone and all two-species combinations were allowed to decompose
   with and without experimental dung addition in the field. Mass loss of
   the leaf litter was measured after 6 and 12 mo. High-quality litter
   species had significantly greater mass loss than low-quality litter
   species. Dung significantly accelerated litter mass loss after both 6
   and 12 mo for low-quality litter species, but only after 12 mo for
   high-quality litter species. Litter mixtures containing both high- and
   low-quality species showed positive nonadditive effects (NAEs) on mass
   loss after 6 mo but additive effects after 12 mo. Dung increased the
   strength of NAEs after 6 mo and shifted litter mixing effects from
   positive to negative NAEs after 12 mo. Our results support previous
   findings that litter mixing could produce NAEs on litter decomposition
   and that these NAEs could change with incubation time. Most importantly,
   we show that dung can modify NAEs, demonstrating that litter mixing
   effects are dependent on the microenvironment. Our findings also
   demonstrate that yak dung can influence soil processes by varying both
   single-species litter decomposition rates and litter interactions within
   mixtures. Furthermore, the results suggest yak dung is closely related
   to material and nutrient cycling, so we believe dung should remain and
   not be substantially removed from this grazing ecosystem. (C) 2018 The

Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{15-24}},

Abstract = {{Land-use legacies are recognized determinants of vegetation dynamics and
   plant community assembly. The duration of these legacies and how they
   influence the structure of vegetation communities developing naturally
   in nutrient-poor ecosystems is not well understood. Here, we focus on
   the effects of increased nutrient availability from previous
   agricultural practices on multiple vegetation properties in a heathland
   where agriculture and domestic grazing ceased near 1870 and 1895,
   respectively. We compared diversity, compositional and functional
   properties of the vegetation responses to land-use legacies in the soil
   between areas with different agricultural histories (previously
   cultivated vs. uncultivated). Diversity measures were found to be higher
   in the previously cultivated soils. beta-diversity was mainly driven by
   changes in species relative cover and increased with increasing nutrient
   availability in the cultivated area. Furthermore, functional traits
   related to nutrient acquisition (SLA and Leaf Nitrogen content) and the
   changes in vegetation composition were directly linked to soil
   properties only in the previously cultivated part of the heathland.
   Together these results revealed a shift to a deterministic control of
   the plant community, where increased nutrient availability leads to
   stronger associations between soil and vegetation properties. This
   suggests that as nutrients become available, niche differentiation and
   competitive interactions become the predominant underlying mechanisms
   structuring the community. Our study shows that land-use legacies of
   moderate intensity can alter the assembly mechanisms and diversity
   patterns in unmanaged vegetation that can be maintained after more than
   a century since cessation of agricultural practice. Identifying land-use
   legacies and understanding how they structure heathland communities can
   thus lead to management decisions adapted to the specific assembly
   mechanisms and result in a more effective management. (C) 2018

Title = {{Grazing Altered the Pattern of Woody Plants and Shrub Encroachment in a
   Temperate Savanna Ecosystem}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Ulmus pumila-dominated temperate savanna is an important tree-grass
   complex ecosystem in the Otindag sand land, northern China. To date, few
   investigations have been undertaken on the spatial patterns and
   structure of this ecosystem and its driving factors under different
   grazing pressures. The objective of our study therefore is to explore
   whether grazing has affected the population structure/pattern of woody
   plants and shrub encroachment in a temperate savanna ecosystem. Results
   indicate that species richness and seedlings decreased with increasing
   grazing pressure. An increase in grazing pressure did not significantly
   affect adult-tree density, but it hindered the normal regeneration of U.
   pumila seedlings, further inducing population decline. U. pumila
   seedlings had a more significant aggregated distribution than juvenile
   or adult trees. The adult and juvenile trees had an aggregated
   distribution at the small scale and a random distribution at the large
   scale. Shrubs also showed a significant aggregated distribution. No
   clear effect on the spatial patterns of adult trees was observed;
   however, there was a noticeable effect for juveniles and seedlings under
   different grazing pressures. U. pumila seedlings had a positive
   association with their juveniles and Spiraea aquilegifolia, but a
   negative association with Caragana microphylla. Shrub encroachment
   occurred with decreasing grazing pressures. In conclusion, overgrazing
   led to the decline of U. pumila population, but the decrease in grazing
   pressure increased shrub encroachment in the temperate savanna
   ecosystem. Moderate grazing management may be a better way to enhance
   the stability of U. pumila population and reduce shrub encroachment.}},

Abstract = {{Brazilian environmental legislation provides protection to native flora
   in different ways. However, the predominantly non-forest ecosystems of
   Brazil have no specific legislation protecting their ecological
   particularities. Many authors have emphasized the relevance of
   recognizing the ecological importance of non-forest ecosystems and the
   need to include them in conservation priorities. Southern Brazil,
   northeastern Argentina and Uruguay harbor one of the most fascinating
   ecosystems of the southern South American grasslands, the Butia palm
   groves. These are natural non-forest ecosystems dominated by populations
   of Butia species (Arecaceae) scattered through the grassy matrix. Land
   conversion to agriculture, silviculture and urban sprawl are the
   greatest threats to these palm species. For instance, in the southern
   Brazilian Pampa grasslands where palm groves were once very abundant,
   26\% of the natural grasslands have been lost over a period of 30 years.
   This significant habitat loss is aggravated by the protection of only
   0.4 per cent of the Pampa biome within legally designated areas.
   Furthermore, palm groves are not recognized in Brazilian official
   vegetation classification systems. Therefore, there is a need to
   recognize non-forest ecosystems as ecologically integral entities. This
   implies the necessity of understanding, for instance, that preservation
   of palm groves is critical to re-establish the natural processes of
   these ecosystems, i.e., to begin to support the natural renewal process
   of palm groves, jointly with conserving the natural grassy matrix and
   all its diverse flora and fauna. Public policies focusing on these
   ecosystems and species must include promotion of sustainable use of
   their products, using their economic value to increase interest in their
   conservation. Practices that ensure the renewal of populations, such as
   conservative grazing management and ecosystem restoration, also need to
   be implemented.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to analyse, using the ecosystem services
   framework, the sociocultural and economic value of a number of positive
   functions of Alpine agroecosystems (in north-eastern Italy) in a context
   of simultaneous processes of intensification and abandonment. Firstly,
   we used qualitative methods (interviews with farmers and other local
   stakeholders) to explore the relationships between the dairy livestock
   systems and the environment. Secondly, we used a choice model to rank
   and value the most important functions of the current agroecosystems
   (dairy livestock systems and permanent crops) according to the views of
   local (residents of the study area) and general (residents of the six
   neighbouring provinces) populations in three policy scenarios. We found
   that all the local stakeholders had a positive opinion of the outcomes
   of the mountain dairy livestock system. Within the current
   agroecosystems, regulation services (water quality) were found to be the
   most valuable for the well-being of society. Moreover, people were
   willing to compromise on production (quality products) rather than cut
   back on environmental services in a hypothetical sustainable development
   scenario. The current trend of intensification of permanent crops and
   dairy production, with the consequent abandonment of summer pastures,
   was rejected by respondents. The Total Economic Value of a set of four
   ecosystem services of an Alpine agroecosystem was 159.30 per person per
   year, which clearly exceeded current expenditure on agroenvironmental
   programmes.}},

Abstract = {{The tropical rain forests of northwest South America fall within the
   Choco-Darien Global Ecoregion (CGE). The CGE is one of 25 global
   biodiversity hotspots prioritized for conservation due to its high
   biodiversity and endemism as well as threats due to deforestation. The
   analysis of land-use and land-cover (LULC) change within the CGE using
   remotely sensed imagery is challenging because this area is considered
   to be one of the rainiest places on the planet (hence high frequency of
   cloud cover). Furthermore, the availability of high-resolution remotely
   sensed data is low for developing countries before 2015. Using the
   Random Forest ensemble learning classification tree system, we developed
   annual LULC maps in the CGE from 2002 to 2015 using a time series of
   cloud-free MODIS vegetation index products. The MODIS imagery was
   processed through a Gaussian weighted filter to further correct for
   cloud pollution and matched to visual interpretations of land cover and
   land use from available high spatial resolution imagery (WorldView-2,
   Quick Bird, Ikonos and GeoEye-1). Validation of LULC maps resulted in a
   Kappa of 0.87 (Sd = 0.008). We detected a gradual replacement of
   forested areas with agriculture (mainly grassland planted to support
   livestock grazing), and secondary vegetation (agriculture reverting to
   forest) across the CGE. Forest loss was higher between 2010-2015 when
   compared to 2002-2010. LULC change trends, deforestation drivers, and
   reforestation transitions varied according to administrative
   organization (countries: Panamanian CGE, Colombian CGE, and Ecuadorian
   CGE).}},

Abstract = {{The biodiversity-productivity relationship is critical for better
   predicting ecosystem responses to climate change and human disturbance.
   However, it remains unclear about the effects of climate change, land
   use shifts, plant diversity, and their interactions on productivity
   partitioning above- and below-ground components in alpine grasslands on
   the Tibetan Plateau. To answer this question, we conducted field surveys
   at 33 grazed vs. fenced paired sites that are distributed across the
   alpine meadow, steppe, and desert-steppe zones on the northern Tibetan
   Plateau in early August of 2010-2013. Generalized additive models (GAMs)
   showed that aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) linearly
   increased with growing season precipitation (GSP) while belowground net
   primary productivity (BNPP) decreased with growing season temperature
   (GST). Compared to grazed sites, short-term fencing did not alter the
   patterns of ANPP along climatic gradients but tended to decrease BNPP at
   moderate precipitation levels of 200 mm < GSP < 450 mm. We also found
   that ANPP and BNPP linearly increased with species richness, ANPP
   decreased with Shannon diversity index, and BNPP did not correlate with
   the Shannon diversity index. Fencing did not alter the relationships
   between productivity components and plant diversity indices. Generalized
   additive mixed models furtherly confirmed that the interaction of
   localized plant diversity and climatic condition nonlinearly regulated
   productivity partitioning of alpine grasslands in this area. Finally,
   structural equation models (SEMs) revealed the direction and strength of
   causal links between biotic and abiotic variables within alpine
   grassland ecosystems. ANPP was controlled directly by GSP (0.53) and
   indirectly via species richness (0.41) and Shannon index (- 0.12). In
   contrast, BNPP was influenced directly by GST (- 0.43) and indirectly by
   GSP via species richness (0.05) and Shannon index (- 0.02). Therefore,
   we recommend using a joint approach of GAMs and SEMs for better
   understanding mechanisms behind the relationship between biodiversity
   and ecosystem function under climate change and human disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Earlier studies emphasized that landscape-level factors were essential
   in shaping arthropod assemblages of semi-natural grasslands. Recently,
   several studies demonstrated that local factors were more important than
   landscape-level factors. We examined the importance of several local and
   landscape-level factors on spider assemblages using pitfall traps from
   eight sandy grassland fragments between 2001 and 2003. We tested three
   hypotheses: (i) species richness decreases with grazing intensity; (ii)
   species richness increasing with fragment size; (iii) the higher
   isolation of fragments results in decreasing species richness. We found
   that species richness of spiders did not depend on the grazing
   intensity, but there were changes in species composition and abundance
   of species among the variously grazed fragments. Out of the other two
   studied local factors (fragment size, and the shape of fragment), only
   the fragment size was a significant predictor of the diversity of
   specialist spiders, since the number of these species increased
   significantly with fragment size. Out of the four investigated
   landscape-level factors (isolation, total area of croplands in the
   landscape, total area of forests in the landscape, and landscape
   diversity), only the isolation was a significant predictor influencing
   spider diversity. The total number of species, the number of generalist
   species and the number of hunting species increased significantly with
   the isolation of fragments. Our results suggest that both local and
   landscape-level factors are important drivers in maintaining spider
   diversity in sandy grasslands; therefore, these factors should be
   considered simultaneously during the restoration and/or management of
   grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{With the proliferation of woody plant species in much of the world's
   grasslands, human has manipulated landscape fire to return their forage
   provisioning service. Yet other ecosystem services (e.g., carbon
   sequestration, biodiversity conservation, erosion control) in the
   post-managed areas compared to those previously available in the
   shrub-encroached area are largely unknown, including trade-offs between
   ecosystem services. Using data from previous publications, we
   quantitatively synthesized the sustainability of lire as shrub
   management practice, expressed as its efficacy to control shrubs and its
   capacity to maintain different ecosystem services. A simple indicator
   (delta), defined as the ratio of an observed ecological attribute
   between area experiencing shrub management and untreated control, was
   used to quantify the changes. Our results showed that fire could be an
   effective strategy to control shrubs and to increase forage provisioning
   service (delta(herbaceous biomass) = 1.39). However, there are possible
   trade-offs with other ecosystem services (e.g., erosion control,
   nutrient cycling) when a 54\% increase in bare soil cover (delta(bare
   soil) = 1.54) and similar to 74\% loss of biological soil crusts cover
   (delta(biological crust) = 0.26) were found. Because increasing forage
   provisioning at the cost of other ecosystem services might not be
   sustainable, management should focus on strategies to minimize such
   trade-offs, which may include but not limited to rotational grazing,
   adjustment in stocking rate, or supplementary external inputs (e.g.,
   fertilizer). Unless those measures are employed, there is possible
   emergence of a novel crash ( i.e., vegetation- and resource-poor
   scabland) resulting from a combination of soil erosion and high
   vulnerability of burnt landscape to exotic species invasion. (C) 2018

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{With increasing affluence in many developing countries, the demand for
   livestock products is rising and the increasing feed requirement
   contributes to pressure on land resources for food and energy
   production. However, there is currently a knowledge gap in our ability
   to assess the extent and intensity of the utilization of land by
   livestock, which is the single largest land use in the world. We
   developed a spatial model that combines fine-scale livestock numbers
   with their associated energy requirements to distribute livestock
   grazing demand onto a map of energy supply, with the aim of estimating
   where and to what degree pasture is being utilized. We applied our model
   to Kazakhstan, which contains large grassland areas that historically
   have been used for extensive livestock production but for which the
   current extent, and thus the potential for increasing livestock
   production, is unknown. We measured the grazing demand of Kazakh
   livestock in 2015 at 286 Petajoules, which was 25\% of the estimated
   maximum sustainable energy supply that is available to livestock for
   grazing. The model resulted in a grazed area of 1.22 million km(2), or
   48\% of the area theoretically available for grazing in Kazakhstan, with
   most utilized land grazed at low intensities (average offtake rate was
   13\% of total biomass energy production). Under a conservative scenario,
   our estimations showed a production potential of 0.13 million tons of
   beef additional to 2015 production (31\% increase), and much more with
   utilization of distant pastures. This model is an important step forward
   in evaluating pasture use and available land resources, and can be
   adapted at any spatial scale for any region in the world.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Abiotic microhabitat amelioration and protection from
   herbivores are two of the main mechanisms associated with facilitative
   interactions in plant communities. Aims: We investigated the effect of
   the shrub Acanthostyles buniifolius on the herbaceous community of a
   subhumid grassland in order to disentangle the protective role of the
   shrub from its effect on ameliorating the abiotic conditions of
   microhabitats. Methods: In two contiguous areas, one continuously grazed
   and the other excluded from livestock for 3 years, we determined
   floristic composition and species cover under the shrub canopy and in
   paired open sites. We calculated the Relative Interaction Index (RII)
   for cover of plant functional types and species. Results: Under grazing,
   C-3 grass richness was higher under the shrub canopy than in open plots.
   Also, the RII was higher in the grazed area for most functional types.
   Inside the exclosure, the cover of C-3 grasses was higher in the
   presence of the shrub. Conversely, the richness and cover of C-4 grasses
   was lower under the shrub canopy. Conclusions: We found evidence of
   facilitation in a subhumid grassland. The shrub may protect grasses from
   grazers and may benefit C-3 grasses through microclimatic amelioration.
   Therefore, photosynthetic pathway should be considered when analysing
   facilitative interactions in mesic environments.}},

Abstract = {{Previous grazing experience on high alpine pastures may help cows to
   optimise feed selection and minimise impairments in milk production.
   Eight inexperienced and eight experienced Aosta Red Pied cows were
   compared (primiparous:multiparous = 1:1). Measurements were performed
   when cows grazed sites at 600, 1800 and 2100 m a.s.l. The statistical
   model included experience, parity and site as fixed effects. The longest
   ingestion time was recorded for primiparous inexperienced cows at 1800 m
   a.s.l. Milk yield remained unaffected by experience, but the main
   milking time was shorter in inexperienced cows in the lowlands. Milk of
   inexperienced cows had a higher urea content than experienced cows.
   Somatic cell score remained unaffected by experience, but inexperienced
   cows had more incidences of clinical mastitis on alpine pastures.
   Compared with experienced cows, proportions of the fatty acids sigma
   C16:1 and sigma C17:1 in milk fat of inexperienced cows were higher and
   proportions of C18:1 t9 and C18:1 t6-8 lower. Overall, alpine grazing
   had substantial effects on milk yield and composition coinciding with
   results from previous studies. There were interactions between
   experience and site in milking characteristics and milk composition, and
   for the latter also between experience and parity. In conclusion,
   experience had effects on several of the variables tested, effects which
   were sometimes exhibited already on lowland pasture. Still, the effects
   of experience were much lower than those of the transhumance system.}},

Abstract = {{The traditional management of hay meadows has allowed them to maintain a
   notable part of biodiversity currently threatened by recent changes in
   agricultural uses. In the North Eastern region of France, the large
   pink, Dianthus superbus L. (Caryophyllaceae), mainly grows in hay
   meadows, and its protected status implies a conservation strategy
   merging information about its demography, its genetic diversity and its
   ecology. This study has revealed that the population size of D. superbus
   is correlated with the trophic status of meadows, with a decrease from
   mesotrophic to eutrophic meadows. No relation has been established
   between population size and habitat size, spatial isolation or habitat
   connectivity. Moreover, AFLPs genetic fingerprints indicated equivalent
   genetic diversities among meadows, without impact of population size or
   habitat characteristics. The absence of genetic structure and the lack
   of population differentiation suggest a large genetic admixture at the
   regional scale. The most crucial issue for the conservation of D.
   superbus in the North Eastern region of France seems to be the
   modification of its habitat due to the eutrophication of hay meadows.}},

   A Long-Term Perspective to Support Biodiversity Awareness}},

Abstract = {{The present-day Mediterranean landscape is a result of the long-term
   human-environment-climate interactions that have driven the ecological
   dynamics throughout the Holocene. Pastoralism had (and still has) an
   important role in shaping this landscape, and contributes to maintaining
   the mosaic patterns of the Mediterranean habitats. Palaeoecological
   records provide significant multi-proxy data on environmental changes
   during the Holocene that are linked to human activities. In such
   research, the palynological approach is especially useful for detailing
   the complexity of anthropogenically-driven landscape transformations by
   discriminating past land uses and pastoral/breeding activities. This
   paper focuses on the palynological evidence for the impact of centuries
   of grazing on the vegetation of Basilicata, a region of southern Italy
   where animal breeding and pastoralism have a long tradition. A set of
   121 pollen samples from eight archaeological sites (dated from the 6th
   century BC to the 15th century AD) and five modern surface soil samples
   were analyzed. The joint record of pollen pasture indicators and spores
   of coprophilous fungi suggests that continuous and intense pastoral
   activities have been practiced in the territory and have highly
   influenced its landscape. The palaeoecological results of this study
   provide us with better knowledge of the diachronical transformations of
   the habitats that were exposed to continuous grazing, with a shift
   toward more open vegetation and increase of sclerophyllous shrubs. The
   palynological approach gives insights into the vocation and
   environmental sustainability of this southern Italy region on a
   long-term basis.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing data have been widely used in the study of large-scale
   vegetation activities, which have important significance in estimating
   grassland yields, determining grassland carrying capacity, and
   strengthening the scientific management of grasslands. Remote sensing
   data are also used for estimating grazing intensity. Unfortunately, the
   spatial distribution of grazing-induced degradation remains undocumented
   by field observation, and most previous studies on grazing intensity
   have been qualitative. In our study, we tried to quantify grazing
   intensity using remote sensing techniques. To achieve this goal, we
   conducted field experiments at Gansu Province, China, which included a
   meadow steppe and a semi-arid region. The correlation between a
   vegetation index and grazing intensity was simulated, and the results
   demonstrated that there was a significant negative correlation between
   NDVI and relative grazing intensity (p < 0.05). The relative grazing
   intensity increased with a decrease in NDVI, and when the relative
   grazing intensity reached a certain level, the response of NDVI to
   relative grazing intensity was no longer sensitive. This study shows
   that the NDVI model can illustrate the feasibility of using a vegetation
   index to monitor the grazing intensity of livestock in free-grazing
   mode. Notably, it is feasible to use the remote sensing vegetation index
   to obtain the thresholds of livestock grazing intensity.}},

Title = {{Multivariate drivers of diversity in temperate Australian native
   grasslands}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{367-380}},
Abstract = {{Disturbance has been considered essential for maintaining biodiversity
   in temperate grassy ecosystems in Australia. This has been particularly
   well demonstrated for inter-tussock plant species in C-4
   Themeda-dominated grasslands in mesic environments. Disturbance is also
   thought crucial to maintain the structure of preferred habitat for some
   animals. Relationships between disturbance and diversity may be
   contingent on ecosystem productivity, but little is known about the
   generality of the disturbance-promoting-diversity paradigm across the
   range of temperate grasslands. To date, the
   disturbance-promoting-diversity paradigm has taken a univariate approach
   to the drivers of biodiversity; rainfall is seen as a key driver of
   productivity, which then drives diversity, mediated by disturbance. We
   argue that this framework is too simplistic as biodiversity drivers are
   multivariate. We suggest that the accumulation of phytomass (live and
   dead plant material) is an important determinant of diversity in grassy
   ecosystems and that phytomass accumulation is governed by multiple
   drivers (of which disturbance is just one). For fauna, it is structure -
   not biomass - that determines habitat suitability, and this can be
   moderated by both abiotic and biotic drivers. The assumption that there
   is a consistent effect of disturbance on diversity through the range of
   temperate grassland settings in southern Australia ignores the
   likelihood that biodiversity also responds to other factors such as
   spatial heterogeneity in the environment, resource availability and
   climatic variation. We developed a conceptual model of the multivariate
   drivers of grassland diversity that explores mechanisms underpinning
   patterns of species richness. Despite four decades of research, it is
   clear that our understanding of the multivariate drivers of diversity
   across the range of temperate grasslands in Australia is still
   incomplete. Further research into the conditions under which disturbance
   is required to maintain biodiversity in grasslands is integral to
   conservation planning in these endangered systems.}},

Abstract = {{Unpalatable plants reportedly serve as a biodiversity refuge. However,
   few studies have been conducted to evaluate how unpalatable plants
   impact vegetation composition in alpine ecosystems. In the present study
   we investigated alpine meadows at four sites in four different
   prefectures on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau of Qinghai Province,
   China. The study sites included meadows grazed by livestock (AO) and
   others in the vicinity colonised by the unpalatable grass, Achnatherum
   inebrians (AI), which the livestock avoided. The results showed: (1)
   palatable graminoid species were significantly different in the two
   groups: AO plots were dominated by Kobresia spp. (sedges), whereas AI
   plots were dominated by Poa pratensis and Elymus nutans (grasses); (2)
   graminoid diversity was significantly higher in AI than in AO plots; (3)
   grasses had significantly more seeds in AI than in AO plots. We suggest
   a three-step process for the invasion of A. inebrians into overgrazed
   alpine meadows in Northern China. First, soil is disturbed by rodents.
   Second, disturbed soil is invaded by A. inebrians. Third, the A.
   inebrians community is colonised by palatable grasses such as Elymus,

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{153-161}},
Abstract = {{To address biodiversity and agronomic value of grasslands, we attempted
   to determine the effect of management regimes on temporal plant species
   diversity of Arrhenatherion grassland vegetation over a 7-year period.
   In a split-plot experiment, three cutting regimes (traditional 2-cut
   system, modified and regular 4-cut systems) and five fertilisation
   regimes {[}i) zero; ii) phosphorus-potassium (PK); iii) cattle slurry;
   iv) nitrogen-PK (NPK) plus cattle slurry; v) NPK] were assigned to the
   main plots and the subplots, respectively. Significant temporal changes
   in plant species composition, abundance of functional groups, plant
   richness and Shannon index were found for most investigated regimes. The
   effects of fertilisation regimes on all investigated parameters were
   much stronger than cutting regimes. Generally, two distinct pathways of
   sward compositional development were found, depending on whether the
   mineral N was added or not. Differentiation in the plant species
   composition and abundance of functional groups started in the second
   year and continued with the progress of the experiment. A quite distinct
   pattern of change in the plant species composition was found for PK
   where initially higher abundance of legumes triggered the sward
   development similar to the slurry-fertilisation regime. The
   fertilisation with high N rates caused temporal decrease in species
   richness and Shannon index. Other fertilisation treatments did not
   affect these two diversity parameters in a seven-year period. The
   cutting regimes did not temporally differentiate the sward regarding
   plant species composition and abundance of functional groups. They
   affected only plant species composition in the seventh year and
   indicated some effect on the temporal change of Shannon index.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic activities have modified vegetation on subalpine belts for
   a long time, lowering the treeline ecotone and influencing the landscape
   mainly through grazing and fire. The abandonment of these traditional
   land use practices during the last decades and global warming are
   contributing largely to the colonization of woody species in subalpine
   grasslands, causing irreversible changes in ecosystem functioning. A
   variety of management strategies requiring the use of fire and/or
   clear-cutting are carried out to prevent the expansion of highly
   encroaching shrubs and improve the conservation status of subhumid
   high-productive grasslands ecosystems. However, it is still poorly
   understood how different management strategies affect the recovery of
   subalpine grasslands, which is influenced concurrently by the vegetation
   community involved. In this study we used field experiments to test the
   impact of management treatments on soil properties and vegetation
   responses in subalpine Bromion erecti grassland communities colonized by
   the pyrophyte shrub Echinospartum horridum (Vahl) Rothm. on the southern
   Pyrenees. Vegetation was monitored for 5 years in E. horridum plots (two
   plots per treatment) where the vegetation was removed by prescribed fire
   (Burnt treatment) or by mechanical removal (Clear-cut treatment).
   Undisturbed E. horridum plots were used as a control (C-Erizon) for
   shrub removal treatments and a Bromion erecti grassland community
   regularly grazed (C-Grass) was used as a control for subalpine
   grassland. Clear-cut treatment of E. horridum community was more
   effective to control E. horridum colonization than Burnt treatment and
   contributed to a higher extent to recover original grassland vegetation,
   because E. horridum seedling performed worse (lower germination rates)
   and plant species were more similar to the original grassland (legumes,
   non-legume forbs, and grasses). Shrubs and sub-shrubs cover in Burnt
   areas increased faster than in Clear-cut areas during the 5 years
   following the treatment, although it did not reach the level of
   C-Erizon. Species richness and diversity increased in comparison with
   C-Erizon in both treatments, but they were significantly lower than
   those in the C-Grass. Network connectivity was larger in well preserved
   grasslands, i.e, C-Grass, than in any other treatments, mainly dominated
   by negative plant-plant association. Soils nutrients declined in Burnt
   sites 4 years after the fire treatment and no difference was observed
   between Clear-cut and C-Erizon sites, although they did not reach the
   soil fertility values of C-Grass in terms of organic matter and C/N
   ratio. This study showed that grazing favors plant diversity and
   community complexity in subalpine grasslands. It also demonstrated that
   clearing is a better strategy than burning to restore grasslands after
   shrub encroachment because burning entails deeper soil degradation and
   faster recovering of the pyrophyte shrub, E. horridum.}},

Abstract = {{People have significantly influenced on Orenburg region steppes by
   ploughing large parts of it, or by utilising other parts as mowed
   grasslands, pastures or abandoning crop production on the old abandoned
   fields. Frequent fires are another serious threat to the biodiversity of
   the steppes in the region. The main cause of fires is the anthropogenic
   factor. This problem is relevant not only for managed areas, but also
   for Protected Areas. The need to study the fire effects on ecosystems in
   the Orenburg State Nature Reserve (Russia) has appeared for a long time,
   once it cleared that a special regime of Protected Areas could not
   always preserve steppes of fire influence due to the steppe's specifics
   (i.e., significant length of the fire front and a burnt area, high speed
   of a fire spread under strong wind). At the same time, it is most
   relevant to conduct environmental studies in the Protected Areas as
   ecosystems, least managed and disturbed by humans. It is supplemented by
   excluding of any impacts within these areas and using data of long-term
   research accumulated over previous years. In 2015-2016, we carried out
   the post-fire dynamics of the stock of the above-ground phytomass in the
   site ``Burtinskaya Steppe{''} in the Orenburg State Natural Reserve. The
   study area is located in the steppe zone of the Pre-Ural region. In
   August 2014, more than 20 km(2) of the steppe area was on fire. We
   established six study sites in this area. Each of them included a
   control (unburnt) and a burnt plots. In each plant community, we
   conducted the geobotanical surveys and mowing of the above-ground
   phytomass in spring (May), summer (June), late summer (August), autumn
   (September). The obtained samples were dried, divided into groups
   (grasses, forbs, dwarf semi-shrubs) and then weighted. We compared both
   unburnt and burnt study plots, and found statistically significant
   differences between them using the Mann-Whitney U-test (alpha < 0.05) in
   the total stock of the above-ground phytomass, stock of the dead
   phytomass, the standing dead phytomass, and litter. In the burnt plant
   communities, the accumulation peaks of the living grass and forbs
   phytomass shifted compared to the unburnt plots. During the first two
   post-fire years, only stock of the living phytomass and its components
   (grasses, forbs, dwarf semi-shrubs) were restoring. Other components of
   the above-ground phytomass did not reach the control values. Our data
   were part of a project for creation a framework to monitor ecosystems in
   the preserved area after the 2014 fire impact.}},

Abstract = {{This article reports on modelling of the farm-level financial
   implications of changing land use from rangelands grazing to carbon
   farming' (vegetation-based carbon sequestration) in north-western New
   South Wales, Australia. Four model farm businesses were created by
   combining information from existing carbon projects funded under the
   Australian Government's Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF), data from
   surveys of farm businesses in the study regions and biomass estimations
   from the pasture growth model, GRASP. Scenarios for each of the
   businesses were: baseline (current grazing system); clearing vegetation
   to increase carrying capacity; establishing a carbon project; and
   establishing a carbon project and reinvesting some of the additional
   income in exclusion fencing to increase carrying capacity on non-project
   areas. The carbon project scenarios were based on either of two approved
   carbon sequestration methodologies within the ERF: avoided
   deforestation; and human-induced regeneration. In comparing the
   financial outcomes of these scenarios across the modelled businesses, we
   found potential advantages for landholders in having projects where
   livestock carrying capacity was at medium to low levels for the study
   region and where woody vegetation biomass potential was medium to high
   for the region. The case for sequestration projects on land with higher
   carrying capacity and therefore higher opportunity cost was much less
   compelling. In most cases, reinvestment in exclusion fencing resulted in
   similar financial returns to just having a carbon project but farm
   business income increased in later years.}},

Abstract = {{Since the emergence of steppe habitats, ungulates have been their
   integral part. Daily grazing of wild ungulates had a beneficial effect
   on soil vegetation and microclimate. Unfortunately, herds of wild horses
   have vanished and been replaced by livestock. An investigated virgin
   land was a forb plant community with a predominance of Stipa lessingiana
   and Festuca valesiaca. As phytocoenosis degraded, the occurrence of
   Artemisia austriaca increased, and complete replacement of forbs by
   wormwood steppe was observed. The presented results obtained in the
   ecosystems of pastures subjected to zoogenic aridisation demonstrate
   that the agrocoenosis first loses mesophilic components of the
   Coleoptera fauna (Athous haemorrhoidalis, Calathus erratus, C.
   melanocephalus, Crypticus quisquilius, Pedinus femoralis, Melanotus
   rufipes, M. niger, Selatosomus gravidus, Poecilus lepidus, P. sericeus,

   which include Calathus halensis, Cymindis angularis, Harpalus rufipes,
   Ophonus stictus, Blaps halophila, Gonocephalum granulatum, Platyscelis
   hypolitha, Agriotes sputator. Therefore, a change in the structure and

   composition, soil structure under excessive load, and soil dampness

   Iberian Peninsula in the last 20,000 years. Importance of the effect of
   large herbivores on vegetation}},
Journal = {{CUADERNOS DE INVESTIGACION GEOGRAFICA}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{87-121}},
Abstract = {{Mega-herbivores (body mass greater than 1000 kg) help structuring the
   plant landscape through consumption, breakage and uprooting of numerous
   woody plants, tending to transform wooded areas into grass, shrub and
   forest mosaics. These mosaics contribute to maintain a high
   biodiversity, since they enable the persistence of plants and animals of
   dense forests and treeless steppes, which alternated in the European
   landscapes following the glacial cycles of the Pleistocene. The
   disappearance of the mega-herbivores from the Iberian Peninsula at the
   end of the Pleistocene probably caused a cascade of ecological effects
   that remains unknown. We also do not know if the causes of their
   disappearance were natural or anthropogenic, and consequently it is not
   know if the plant landscapes that developed later, in the Holocene, have
   a natural or anthropogenic origin.
   The aim of this review is to explore in the scientific literature the
   hypothesis that the transformation of the natural landscape by humans
   began after their arrival in Europe through the intensive hunting of
   large herbivores, until their disappearance or extreme reduction.
   Consequently, the forest recovery of the end of the Pleistocene and
   beginning of the Holocene might have taken place without the containment
   that these animals would have exerted on woody vegetation in the
   previous interglacials. As a result, dense forests would spread over
   large territories reducing pastures and herbivores of open spaces, which
   were the sustenance of Homo sapiens in the Pleistocene. This limitation
   would force humans to change their diet to survive and, in a relatively
   short period of time, to adopt a new way of life-style based on
   livestock and agriculture.
   The results of the review do not allow us to support or reject the
   hypothesis raised, or even any of the most relevant issues arising from
   it. Some fundamental grounds of this hypothesis are currently debated,
   and are giving rise to contrasting interpretations.
   The most relevant ecological aspects found after the literature review
   are discussed, some ideas are proposed for their interpretation, and the
   limitations of the paleo-ecological information available in the
   literature to answer general questions such as those posed here, are
   emphasized.}},

Pages = {{328-336}},
Abstract = {{Dung beetles are often used as indicators of forest health. However, not
   much is known about the non-forest dwelling dung beetle species of the
   Malay Peninsula and the species in this habitat have not been compared
   to communities recorded in anthropogenically altered habitats in South
   East Asia. Grassland along forest edges is the habitat of grazing
   megafauna and the dung produced by these mammals is a potentially large
   resource to dung beetles that can adapt to non-forest habitats. In this
   study, we classified 25 dung beetle species associated with elephant
   dung based on their habitat preference. We sampled six different
   localities on the Malay Peninsula, placing transects within forests and
   along forest edges. Elephant dung baited traps were deployed at regular
   intervals along these transects. Forest sampling points had higher
   abundance, species richness and Shannon diversity than forest edge
   sampling points, but there was no significant difference in species
   accumulation curves or rarefied species richness. Hierarchical cluster
   analysis and ordination indicated a clear division between forest and
   forest edge species. A binomial generalised linear mixed model further
   showed that 14 species preferred forest habitats and eight preferred
   forest edge habitats. These classifications largely agreed with previous
   habitat preference studies conducted in Borneo and Sulawesi. It is
   likely that habitat preference in dung beetles is dependent on abiotic
   factors such as temperature as well as biotic factors such as forest
   cover and mammalian diversity. The lack of records of non-forest species
   in literature indicates that non-forest habitats may be neglected in
   terms of dung beetle studies.}},

   phytophagous bugs and total grasshopper species richness were associated
   with total flower cover. Surrounding forest area negatively affected
   bugs, while open landscape positively affected bugs, both regarding
   species richness and abundance, number of phytophagous species and
   individuals and individuals overwintering as egg. Species assemblages of
   the three insect groups did not significantly differ between meadow
   types. Extensive management is important to preserve bumblebee and bug
   richness. However, abandoned meadows, which are not yet regrown into
   forest can still act as suitable habitats for the three insect groups.}},

Title = {{Landscape heterogeneity influences the response of grassland birds to
   energy development}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Abstract = {{Grasslands are inherently dynamic systems having developed with frequent
   disturbance from fire and grazing that varies in space and time to
   create heterogeneity. Today, many management practices emphasize the
   even use of grasslands by grazers and either no fire or uniform fires,
   resulting in grasslands that lack the variability in plant structure and
   composition to support the entire suite of grassland biodiversity.
   Previous research has suggested that the reintroduction of variable
   disturbance may be among the best conservation strategies for grassland
   birds, as these practices promote diversity and abundance of many
   species. However, the reintroduction of heterogeneity is taking place in
   the context of the continued development of grasslands for energy
   production, and the utility of heterogeneity based management practices
   may decline in fragmented landscapes. We investigated how fragmentation
   from oil and gas may constrain management efforts to promote
   biodiversity by evaluating changes in bird abundance with distance from
   roads and conventional oil wells across a gradient of times since fire.
   We found that time since fire was the primary driver of grassland bird
   distribution, with dickcissels, eastern meadowlark and grasshopper
   sparrows occurring in all vegetation patches, while Henslow's sparrows
   primarily occurred in patches that were greater than 13 months post-fire
   and upland sandpipers were mostly detected in recent burns. Further,
   Henslow's sparrows avoided oil wells for considerable distances, while
   eastern meadowlark was more abundant in areas close to oil wells in
   vegetation patches that were one-year post-fire. Grasshopper sparrows
   avoided roads in recent burns and dickcissels, and eastern meadowlarks
   were attracted to roads in patches that were recently burned and
   one-year post-fire, respectively. The restoration of heterogeneous fire
   regimes will benefit bird communities by creating variable vegetation
   structure that can support multiple grassland bird species; however,
   energy development has the potential to fragment grasslands for some
   species.}},

   Algerian steppe rangelands}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{97-107}},
Abstract = {{The decline in steppe vegetation in Algeria was first reported in the
   mid-20th century, and for many years was attributed to recurrent
   droughts. Hypotheses suggesting that this decline was a consequence of
   human activities emerged in the 1970s - a time of major socioeconomic
   trends in the region. Changes such as strong population growth,
   sedentarisation, herd size increases and use of pasture land for crops,
   all had considerable impact on rangeland vegetation. The aim of the
   present work was to identify heterogeneity in the pasture vegetation of
   a given territory' (in the sense of a terroir'), or biophysical
   environment (including meteorological), taking into account rangeland
   distribution, land use changes and herd management in the Aflou region
   of Algeria. Characterisation and mapping of the vegetation and its
   environment in the study area led to the hypothesis that, apart from
   some very slight soil differences, heterogeneity in rangeland vegetation
   appeared mainly related to human impacts. Bertin's Semiology of Graphics
   was used to analyse the results, and indicated a major decline in
   vegetation productivity and biodiversity in the steppe rangelands of the
   study zone. Beyond this general trend in the municipal territory
   studied, areas were found with contrasting flora communities, with some
   showing relatively stable plant communities, while other areas had some
   plant communities that had undergone regressive succession. Grazing
   conditions and the proximity of ploughed land were responsible for these
   different vegetation situations.}},

Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Despite the increasing extent of protected areas throughout the world,
   biodiversity decline continues. Grazing management that promotes both
   biodiversity and production outcomes has the potential to improve
   broad-scale conservation and complement the protected area network. In
   this study we explored the potential to integrate commercial livestock
   grazing and conservation in a semi-arid rangeland in south-eastern
   Australia. Understorey floristic composition and diversity were compared
   at different spatial scales across three grazing management treatments:
   (1) continuous commercial grazing management where paddocks were grazed
   for the majority of the year (8 months per annum); (2) rotational
   commercial grazing management where livestock are frequently rotated and
   paddocks rested for >4 months per annum; and (3) protected areas managed
   for conservation with domestic livestock excluded and grazed only by
   native and feral herbivores. The season of sampling, rainfall, soil
   characteristics and the spatial location of sites were the dominant
   drivers of variability in understorey plant species composition; the
   effect of grazing treatment on understorey plant species composition was
   relatively minor. However, areas managed for conservation and under
   rotational forms of commercial grazing management generally had greater
   floristic richness and diversity than continuously grazed areas, the
   results varying with season (spring/autumn) and soil type
   (clay/sandy-loam), particularly at fine scale (1-m(2) quadrats). These
   findings indicate that rotational grazing management on commercial
   properties has the potential to improve biodiversity conservation
   outside the reserve system compared to conventional grazing management.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{51}},
Abstract = {{Human activity has extensively transformed the land surface by
   agricultural intensification and urbanization. In soil, nematodes are
   the most abundant invertebrates. The effect of human interventions was
   assessed on overall richness, overall abundance, richness and abundance
   of nematodes of each trophic group and colonizer-persister (c-p) guild
   by comparing urban, agriculture and disturbed grassland (DGL) with
   natural grassland (NGL) and forest ecosystems. Meta-analyses were
   conducted to generate quantitative summaries from 111 published articles
   that met the inclusion criteria, 91 expressed data in grams and 20
   expressed data in cm(3). Results from data expressed per 100 g of soil
   indicated that overall richness was higher in forest than in NGL, DGL,
   urban, and agriculture ecosystems. The richness of all c-p guilds and of
   all trophic groups except herbivores was highest in forest ecosystems.
   In contrast, overall abundance was highest in DGL, agriculture and
   forest ecosystems. The abundance of c-p 1, c-p 2 and c-p 3 guilds and
   bacterivores, fungivores and herbivores was highest in disturbed
   ecosystems, while the abundance of c-p 4 and c-p 5 guilds and predators
   and omnivores was highest in relatively undisturbed ecosystems. Results
   from data expressed as nematodes per 100 cm3 of soil indicated that
   abundance followed a similar pattern, but richness often differed
   between the two methodologies. These meta-analyses strengthen the
   concept that human interventions adversely impact both richness and
   abundance using nematodes as soil health bioindicators.}},

Abstract = {{Grazed pastures are important habitats that support high biodiversity.
   However, in recent decades pasture management practices have experienced
   drastic changes. To identify better management practices that permit the
   coupling of productivity and biodiversity conservation, attention must
   be given to the intensity of grazing management. By using a recognized
   bio-indicator group such as dung beetles, we analysed the impact of
   grazing intensity on assemblage composition in a gradient from abandoned
   grazing to low and moderate grazing levels. Moreover, we studied whether
   or not assemblage composition shifts are related to species-specific
   responses or to more generalized effects by categorizing dung beetles
   into functional groups. We found differential effects on dung beetle
   communities depending on their feeding and reproductive behaviour;
   ``no-nest building{''} species were the functional group most affected
   because of their inability to relocate food. Moreover, the decreased
   level of herbivory in abandoned areas led to shrub and tree
   encroachments. We demonstrated that dung beetles from abandoned areas
   were sensitive to this incipient habitat change due to the presence of
   indicator species associated with shrub and woodland habitats.
   Therefore, community composition varies depending on both species
   specific and generalized responses due to the sensitivity of ``no-nest
   building{''} species. From a management standpoint, we suggest
   maintaining a low to moderate level of grazing intensity to conserve a
   well-structured functional assemblage of dung beetles.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian zones in the semi-arid West are disproportionately important
   habitats for both breeding birds and agricultural operations. Despite
   growing interest in studying avian-habitat relationships to inform land
   management decisions, few studies have described temporal changes in
   riparian bird communities. We compared indices of avian abundance and
   diversity from 3 streamside vegetation associations in east-central
   Oregon during May-June 2014 with indices from 1993-1994. Our objectives
   were to identify patterns of change in the avian community with a focus
   on riparian shrub-dependent species, re-examine previously reported
   relationships between avian abundance and vegetation volume, and
   identify possible causes of declines in bird abundance and diversity. We
   combined historical field protocols to survey birds and measure riparian
   vegetation with modern analytical techniques. We found few differences
   in species richness between study periods but documented approximately
   30\% species turnover. Increases in diversity were driven by increased
   detections of grassland and wetland bird species and increased evenness
   due to precipitous declines in detections for 2 of 3 riparian
   shrub-dependent focal species (i.e., Yellow Warbler {[}Setophaga
   petechia] and Willow Flycatcher {[}Empidonax traillii]). Detections of
   Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia), our third focal species, declined by
   a smaller margin. Large changes in detections of riparian
   shrub-dependent species did not reflect trends in mesic shrub cover or
   volume, which had been identified as likely drivers of obligate species
   abundance. Focal species' declines reflected regional Breeding Bird
   Survey trends, corroborating our finding that their declines were not a
   result of changes in local site conditions. Our findings suggest that
   managing lands to increase wetness and extent of riparian zones can be
   beneficial for grassland and wetland bird species. However, managing for
   riparian shrub cover or volume, important metrics of grazing intensity
   and riparian system health, may be insufficient to conserve riparian
   shrub-dependent birds because other unidentified local and/or regional
   factors are likely contributing to habitat suitability of riparian

   The meadow species composition, structure, and diversity in areas mown

   the natural habitat and woody vegetation areas were also analysed. The
   results showed a 40\% reduction in natural habitat and a 57\% increase
   in woody vegetation coverage over a six-year period, which indicates
   rapid and progressive succession. The increases in abundance of
   Deschampsia caespitose, Alopecurus pratensis, Holcus lanatus, and
   Anthoxanthum odoratum indicated the progressive degradation of fresh hay
   meadow communities attributed to the cessation of mowing. The expansive
   species Urtica dioica increased in abundance and persistence with
   reduced mowing intensity. Alien species such as Solidago canadensis and

Abstract = {{Questions Fens are important conservation targets in temperate Europe.
   When hydrologically undisturbed, fens remain open for millennia.
   However, unaltered fens are scarce, and today their biodiversity largely
   depends on conservational mowing applied to prevent successional shifts.
   However, the effects on community structure and conservation values are
   uncertain, and management might not always be needed where it is a
   priori applied by managers. Thus, within the presented study, we ask the
   following questions: (a) How is the species and functional composition
   of fens influenced by mowing? (b) Does mowing increase the conservation
   value of fen ecosystems? Location Lowland fens, northern Poland. Methods
   The sample consisted of 27 pairs of mown and unmown plots, located
   within ten sites. Ordination methods were used to assess the influence
   of mowing on species composition. Functional traits related to
   competitiveness, flowering time, mycorrhizal associations and functional
   groups were used to characterize plant communities and species richness,
   and the number of specialist and red-listed species was used to evaluate
   conservation values. Differences between mown and unmown plots were
   assessed using linear mixed-effect models and the effect size approach.
   Results Management of fens suppresses the growth of trees, shrubs and
   highly competitive herbaceous species and inhibits the encroachment of
   Sphagnum mosses. At the same time, it enhances the establishment of
   species from other ecosystems (grasses, ruderal species, species of
   drier sites) within fens and alters the microtopography of the fen
   surface. Conclusions Mowing can enhance species richness and the
   presence of rich fen specialists in transformed sites, but it can lead
   to fen ecosystem deterioration towards managed meadow communities within
   sites sustaining many typical fen species and functional
   characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Questions Are the vegetation structure and soil properties of fallows
   similar to adjacent species-rich Mediterranean steppe communities 35
   years after abandonment? Is there a spontaneous redevelopment towards
   the original steppe vegetation after reintroduction of the traditional
   grazing system? Can differences in functional trait composition be
   identified according to different land-use types? Do traits of selected
   species affect the ability to recolonize fallow land? Location
   Mediterranean steppe of La Crau (Southeastern France). Methods We
   conducted 80 vegetation surveys and soil analyses in the steppe and
   adjacent fallow land in six locations in La Crau in 2015; for three
   locations, data from 2001 were included. To compare the functional
   composition of steppe vs fallow land, community-weighted means (CMW) of
   specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and canopy
   height were calculated. To test whether trait variability is associated
   with the recolonization success of 12 selected target species, we
   measured SLA, LDMC, canopy height, plant width and aboveground biomass
   on eight replicate individuals per site and species. Results Fallow land
   was characterized by lower species richness and elevated phosphorus and
   potassium content in the soil. Comparing vegetation releves between 2001
   and 2015 revealed that the fallows were developing towards steppe
   vegetation. CWMs of SLA were significantly lower and CWM of LDMC higher
   in steppe than in fallow land. There was no similarity in trait
   composition between steppe species that successfully recolonized the
   fallow-land community, and no evidence that intraspecific trait
   variability is associated with recolonization success of these species.
   Conclusions Even after decades of abandonment and reintroduction of the
   grazing system, the vegetation structure, soil properties and plant
   functional trait composition of fallows differ from those of adjacent
   steppe communities. These results illustrate the need for active
   restoration to accelerate the recovery of former arable land to the
   target steppe communities.}},

Abstract = {{Aims We assessed what the effects of fire and grazing are on vegetative
   growth and sexual reproduction of Brachypodium retusum, the dominant
   species of Mediterranean Thero-Brachypodietea grasslands
   ({''}steppes{''}) and on species composition of the associated plant
   community. Location ``La Crau{''}, southeastern France. Methods We set
   up a split-plot experiment testing the effects of fire season (winter,
   summer) and grazing on plant cover, inflorescence number, seed set and
   germination of Brachypodium retusum in traditionally grazed grasslands.
   We further analyzed plant species composition and diversity in
   vegetation releves. The same fire treatments were tested in a second
   experiment in long-term grazing exclosures. Results Brachypodium retusum
   showed a rapid post-fire recovery, but other species of the associated
   plant community, in particular annuals, recovered as fast or even
   faster. Fire increased Brachypodium retusum inflorescence production and
   seed set per inflorescence and this effect was stronger in the summer
   fire treatment. At the community level, fire significantly increased
   species richness, evenness and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity in the second
   post-fire season and again, the summer fire effect was stronger. Grazing
   exclusion for two seasons had only a small effect on Brachypodium
   retusum and the associated plant community. The effect of both fire
   treatments on Brachypodium retusum was similar in long-term exclosures.
   In these exclosures, fire resulted in a community shift towards the
   species composition of traditionally grazed steppes. Conclusions The
   concomitant positive effects of experimental burning on Brachypodium
   retusum reproduction and on plant diversity of Mediterranean steppe
   vegetation suggest that the system is adapted to fire as an important
   driver of community composition. Annual species surviving as seeds are
   as successful in post-fire recovery as perennial resprouters. Prescribed
   burning may be an alternative strategy to restore community structure in
   abandoned (ungrazed) steppes showing a decline in typical grassland
   species after several years of grazing abandonment.}},

Abstract = {{Question Steppes may be sensitive to rainfall and nitrogen (N) pulses;
   however, their potential effects on local colonization and extinction
   during postgrazing steppe succession have not been thoroughly elucidated
   to date. We addressed how increased rainfall and N influenced plant
   species richness, gain, loss, and turnover in an ungrazed steppe.
   Location Northeastern Inner Mongolia, China. Methods We performed a
   five-growing-season field experiment, in which an ungrazed steppe was
   subject to nine different combinations of rainfall and N. The three
   rainfall levels were ambient amount of rainfall, a 14\% increase in
   amount of rainfall, and a 28\% increase in amount of rainfall; the three
   N levels were no N addition, an addition of 5 g N m(-2) year(-1), and an
   addition of 10 g N m(-2) year(-1). We determined successional changes at
   the taxonomic and functional levels by surveying plant species in the
   first and fifth growing seasons. Results (a) Increased rainfall and N
   addition did not affect plant species richness but did influence plant
   species loss, gain, and turnover. (b) At the taxonomic level, species
   loss, gain, and turnover decreased monotonically with increasing
   rainfall; N addition decreased species loss and turnover but did not
   influence species gain; the slope of the species loss-gain relation was
   approximately 1.0. (c) At the plant functional group level, increased
   rainfall favored C-3 plants by sustaining species gain and decreasing
   species loss; N addition favored C-4 plants by increasing the species
   gain and decreasing the species loss. Conclusion Increased rainfall and
   simulated N deposition could induce rapid colonization and extinction
   during postgrazing steppe succession, but maintain plant diversity
   homeostasis by equally affecting species colonization and extinction.
   Future rainfall enrichment and N deposition might strongly influence the
   relative abundance of different plant functional groups, thereby
   affecting successional changes under global change.}},

Abstract = {{1. Plants are frequently attacked by consumers that reduce seed numbers.
   However, our ability to predict whether seed loss results in parallel
   changes in future recruitment or plant abundance remains poor. Progress
   in this area requires simultaneously understanding: (1) how spatial
   variation in environmental conditions influence recruitment and other
   demographic rates, and (2) how the magnitude of seed loss varies
   spatially and relative to seed limitation.
   2. We experimentally assessed how postdispersal seed predation by deer
   mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) influenced recruitment of the native
   perennial forb, Gaillardia aristata, in western Montana (USA)
   grasslands. To explore whether seed limitation and the population-level
   consequences of seed predation varied predictably based on environmental
   conditions, we added seeds to plots where mice had access or were
   excluded at sites occurring over a strong gradient of soil
   characteristics and plant community productivity. We also quantified
   whether components of Gaillardia demography varied in ways that may
   compensate for or exacerbate the population-level effects of seed
   predation across this environmental gradient.
   3. Across two replicate years, recruitment was highest at low
   productivity/soil nutrient sites and decreased towards the opposite end
   of the gradient. Postdispersal seed predation strongly reduced
   Gaillardia recruitment in both years, and the impacts of seed predation
   on recruitment were greater at sites with lower productivity and fewer
   soil nutrients and decreased towards the opposite end of the gradient.
   Growth and fecundity varied among populations in ways that could buffer
   Gaillardia populations from stronger effects of seed predation, whereas
   survival varied among populations in a way that may intensify these
   effects.
   4. Synthesis. Together, these results show that postdispersal seed
   predation can importantly limit plant recruitment and that the magnitude
   of these effects were predicted by variation in underlying environmental
   conditions that influence recruitment and other key demographic rates.}},

Title = {{Seasonality promotes grassland diversity: Interactions with mowing,
   fertilization and removal of dominant species}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2019}},

Abstract = {{1. Current biodiversity declines in species-rich grasslands are
   connected with the cessation of management, eutrophication and the
   expansion of dominant grass species. One of the theoretical mechanisms
   limiting biodiversity loss is the ability of subordinate species to
   avoid competitive exclusion by seasonal niche separation from dominant
   species. Here, we explore how seasonality underpins the maintenance of
   diversity in temperate meadows under different management regimes and
   competition intensities in relation to species functional traits.
   2. We studied eight different communities in a long-term meadow
   experiment that manipulated mowing, fertilization and dominant species
   (Molinia caerulea) removal. In each community, species-specific trait
   and biomass data were taken five times during the year to test whether
   seasonal variation in species composition and functional strategies
   enable species to coexist.
   3. Mown unfertilized meadows exhibited pronounced seasonal variations in
   community composition and structure, linked to differences in
   resource-use strategies between mid-summer dominants and the spring and
   autumn subordinates. Higher specific leaf area and foliar nitrogen
   concentration in the fast-growing dominants, and increased water use
   (delta C-13) and nutrient acquisition (delta N-15) efficiency in
   resource-retentive subordinates, best predicted their temporal niche
   separation. Seasonal segregation of species with contrasting strategies
   increased after mowing cessation, and the resulting summer dominance of
   Molinia. Conversely, the seasonal dynamics were markedly reduced by
   fertilization, promoting tall grasses over sedges and forbs throughout
   the entire year, thereby decreasing the overall taxonomic and functional
   diversity. When Molinia was removed the compositional changes during the
   season became less pronounced, being significant only in mown
   unfertilized plots.
   4. Synthesis. Seasonal shifts in community composition reduced the
   competitive interactions and promoted the coexistence of dominant and
   subordinate species. Seasonality reversed the negative mid-summer
   diversity-productivity relationship with a positive one during the
   spring and autumn, and seasonality only prevented diversity loss in
   unfertilized conditions possibly because competition is most intense in
   summer. In fertilized meadows, subordinate species are not able to
   escape competitive exclusion by shifting their phenological peaks to the
   spring or autumn periods because asymmetric competition is intense over
   the entire growing season. Studying seasonal dynamics is key to
   understanding the maintenance of grassland diversity under ongoing land
   use change.}},

Abstract = {{The most common grazing management applied on rangelands is continuous
   grazing. However, it can cause negative changes in vegetation structure
   and ecosystem functioning, leading to rangeland degradation. In Flooding
   Pampa rangelands, scientific evidence in favour of rotational over
   continuous grazing was developed on the humid mesophytic meadow and the
   humid prairie communities, but not on the halophytic steppe community.
   We evaluated the changes in species composition, richness and diversity,
   vegetation and litter cover, functional group composition and forage
   quality during 8 years in halophytic steppe subjected to both continuous
   or rotational grazing, and exclusion from grazing. Grazing exclusion and
   a rotational grazing system caused significant changes in the vegetation
   structure compared with continuous grazing. These treatments increased
   vegetation and litter cover, the contribution of summer and annual and
   perennial winter grasses, all them of high forage value, and encouraged
   the appearance of several grasses adapted to fertile, well drained and
   non-saline soils. Because of these structural changes, species richness,
   diversity and pastoral value increased in the halophytic steppe of the
   Flooding Pampa, in a manner previously demonstrated in other grassland
   communities of this region.}},

Abstract = {{The soil seed bank has a large influence on the potential for grassland
   restoration. This study aimed to characterise the composition, density,
   richness, and evenness of seedlings emerging from the soil seed bank
   under different sheep stocking rates, in a summer grazing system, in
   semi-arid China. Soil was sampled in 2015, a year with extreme drought
   conditions and in 2016, a normal rainfall year. The soil seed bank was
   assessed by measuring seedling emergence under laboratory conditions.
   Comprising 16 species, 85.4\% of the seedlings were concentrated within
   a depth of 0-5 cm. Drought significantly reduced the density and
   richness of the seedlings. Grazing increased the richness of seedlings
   by increasing the richness of aboveground species, and grazing
   significantly reduced the evenness of the seedlings by reducing the
   evenness of aboveground species. Drought significantly reduced the
   similarities between the seedlings and the aboveground species, whereas
   grazing increased similarities in both years. This study revealed that
   the density and richness of seedlings were higher in higher stocking
   rate in drought year. We conclude that negative effects on density,
   richness and evenness of the seedlings caused by drought can be overcome
   by rotational grazing especially at higher stocking rate.}},

Title = {{Biosolids application increases grasshopper abundance in the short term
   in a northern Canadian grassland}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-64}},
Abstract = {{Degraded grasslands are common worldwide, often due to overgrazing by
   livestock; such degradation often reduces plant growth and water
   quality, while increasing soil erosion, wildfires, and invasive species.
   Recent restoration efforts have used organic amendments to increase soil
   nutrients, improve water retention, and increase forage production.
   Biosolids, the stabilised and pathogen-treated remains from wastewater
   treatment plants, have strong impacts on soil nutrients and plant
   growth, but there is very little known about impacts on higher trophic
   levels. We worked on northern grasslands in British Columbia, Canada, to
   test whether biosolids applications changed grasshopper abundances, body
   sizes, or species richness. We used hoop transects to measure density
   and timed net samples to determine richness and evenness. There were
   significantly higher (similar to 3.8 ) grasshopper densities at sites
   where biosolids were applied 1-2 years before sampling compared with
   control sites or sites where biosolids were applied in the year of
   sampling. Tibia lengths of grasshoppers varied with treatment, species,
   and sex, but there was no clear signature of biosolids leading to bigger
   body sizes. There were no significant differences in species richness or
   equitability in relation to the year of the biosolids application.
   Collectively, our results show that biosolids have large impacts on
   grasshopper densities, but no clear impact on community structure or
   body size. Because grasshoppers can be dominant insect herbivores and
   are critical prey for many birds and mammals, our results suggest
   biosolids could be an important tool in the context of site restoration
   or efforts to improve populations of insectivorous vertebrates.}},

Pages = {{73-81}},
Abstract = {{Grazing exclosures and rotational grazing have been extensively applied
   to prevent grassland degradation and to restore grassland ecosystem
   function and services. The mechanisms associated with changes in alpine
   plant traits, and functional diversity under different grazing regimes
   have not been deeply explored. We examined the variations of plant leaf
   traits and functional diversity of an alpine meadow under different
   grazing regimes in a 3-year experiment. The results showed, after 3
   years of yak grazing, that the coverage of Stipa capillata increased,
   whereas that of Kobresia pygmaea decreased under grazing exclosure.
   Stipa capillata had a lower ratio of leaf nitrogen content to phosphorus
   content (N : P) under grazing exclosure than under rotational grazing
   and continuous grazing, whereas Kobresia pygmaea showed no significant
   differences among grazing treatments. Among grazing regimes, the
   specific leaf area (SLA) of Stipa capillata was similar, whereas that of
   Kobresia pygmaea was higher under grazing exclosure. At the
   interspecific level, leaf area and weight were negatively correlated
   with SLA, whereas leaf carbon (C) content, leaf N content, leaf C : P
   and leaf N: P were negatively related to leaf P content and leaf C : N.
   These findings indicated that growth-defence trade-off strategies might
   lead to variations in plant traits and coverage. Large-leaved species,
   due to high maintenance costs, were less commonly distributed in the
   community, and they were better defended and unpalatable to yaks due to
   lower SLA, this formed the species coverage distribution pattern of the
   community. Various N and P utilisation efficiency of different species
   indicated diverse economic resources utilisation strategies might be due
   to niche differentiation in the community. Plots that had been excluded
   from grazing had the lowest functional richness, evenness, and
   divergence. Rotational and continuous grazing were equivalent in
   promoting alpine plant functional diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Symbiotic bacteria in herbivorous insects can have strong beneficial
   impacts on their host's survival, including conferring resistance to
   natural enemies such as parasitoid wasps or pathogens, while also
   imposing energetic costs on the host, resulting in cost-benefit
   trade-offs. Whether these trade-offs favour the hosting of symbionts
   depends on the growth environment of the herbivore. Long-term
   experimental grassland studies have shown that increasing plant species
   richness leads to an increased diversity of associated herbivores and
   their natural enemies. Such a change in natural enemy diversity, related
   to changes in plant diversity, could also drive changes in the community
   of symbionts hosted by the herbivorous insects. Aphids are one model
   system for studying symbionts in insects, and effects of host-plant
   species and diversity on aphid-symbiont interactions have been
   documented. Yet, we still understand little of the mechanisms underlying
   such effects. We review the current state of knowledge of how
   biodiversity can impact aphid-symbiont communities and the underlying
   drivers. Then, we discuss this in the framework of sustainable
   agriculture, where increased plant biodiversity, in the form of
   wildflower strips, is used to recruit natural enemies to crop fields for
   their pest control services. Although aphid symbionts have the potential
   to reduce biological control effectiveness through conferring protection
   for the host insect, we discuss how increasing plant and natural enemy
   biodiversity can mitigate these effects and identify future research
   opportunities. Understanding how to promote beneficial interactions in
   ecological systems can help in the development of more sustainable
   agricultural management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional rural biotopes such as wood-pastures are species-rich
   environments that have been created by low intensity agriculture. Their
   amount has decreased dramatically during the 20th century in whole
   Europe due to the intensification of agriculture. Wood-pastures host
   some fungal species that prefer warm areas and are adapted to semi-open
   conditions, but still very little is known about fungi in these
   habitats. We studied how management, historical land-use intensity,
   present grazing intensity, time since abandonment, and stand conditions
   affect the species richness and community composition of ectomycorrhizal
   fungi. We surveyed fruit bodies on three 10 m x 10 m study plots in 36
   sites and repeated the surveys three times. Half of the sites were
   currently unmanaged but had a grazing history. We measured soil pH, soil
   moisture and the basal area of different tree species, and interviewed
   landowners about grazing history. We found that the proportion of
   broadleaved trees, soil pH, and soil moisture are the major drivers of
   the communities of ectomycorrhizal fungi in boreal wood-pastures.
   Management or grazing intensity did not have significant effects on
   fungal species richness, whereas historical land-use intensity seemed to
   have a negative effect on species richness. To conclude, present stand
   conditions are the most important factors to evaluate when planning the
   conservation of ectomycorrhizal fungi living in semi-open forest
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Forest pastures are an important resource for Mediterranean countries,
   providing cheap forage and a reservoir of biodiversity. A case study was
   conducted of the Kizilova forest pasture (Sutculer) in the Isparta
   district of Southern Turkey in 2014-2016. The aim of the study is to
   determine the plant species, plant-covered area, botanical compositions,
   aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, pasture condition and grazing
   capacity in a pasture. Vegetation sampling was conducted in spring and
   autumn (2014-2016). ``Line intercept{''} and ``quadrat{''} methods were
   used in order to determine the pasture flora of the case study area. The
   finding was that 106 plant taxa belonged to 23 families, out of which 26
   taxa of Asteraceae were determined, while 13 and 11 taxa were determined
   in Lamiaceae and in Poaceae, respectively. The plant-covered area was
   found to be nearly 57.7\%. The botanical composition of pastures' taxa
   is approximately 46.5\% Poaceae, 31.2\% Fabaceae and 22.3\% of other
   families. The aboveground and belowground biomass productions were
   calculated as 414.2 kg/da and 745.2 kg/da, respectively. The results
   indicated that the grazing capacity for an area was on average 153 4
   animal units and the average sufficient pasture area per animal unit was
   1.3 ha. The case study area of pasture condition was determined as
   moderate.}},

Abstract = {{Shrub encroachment into arid grasslands has been associated with reduced
   grass abundance, increased soil erosion, and local declines in
   biodiversity. Livestock overgrazing and the associated reduction of fine
   fuels has been a primary driver of shrub encroachment in the
   southwestern United States, but shrublands continue to persist despite
   livestock removal and grassland restoration efforts. We hypothesized
   that an herbivory feedback from native mammals may contribute to
   continued suppression of grasses after the removal of livestock. Our
   herbivore exclusion experiment in southeastern Arizona included five
   treatment levels and allowed access to native mammals based on their
   relative body size, separating the effects of rodents, lagomorphs, and
   mule deer. We included two control treatments and replicated each
   treatment 10 times (n = 50). We introduced uniform divisions of lawn sod
   (Cynodon dactylon) into each exclosure for 24-hr periods prior to (n =
   2) and following (n = 2) the monsoon rains and used motion-activated
   cameras to document herbivore visitations. In the pre-monsoon trials,
   treatments that allowed lagomorph access had less sod biomass relative
   to other treatments (p 0.001), averaging 44\% (SD 36\%) and 29\% (SD
   45\%) remaining biomass after the 24-hr trial periods. Following the
   onset of monsoons, differences in remaining biomass among treatments
   disappeared. Desert cottontails (Sylvilagus audubonii) were detected
   more frequently than any of the other 11 herbivore species present at
   the site, accounting for 83\% of detections during the pre-monsoon
   trials. Significantly more (p 0.001) desert cottontails were detected
   during the pre-monsoon trials (2,077) compared to the post-monsoon
   trials (174), which coincided with biomass removal from lagomorph
   accessible treatments. We conclude that desert cottontails are
   significant consumers of herbaceous vegetation in shrub-encroached arid
   grasslands and they, along with other native herbivores, may act as a
   biotic feedback contributing to the competitive advantage and
   persistence of shrubs.}},

Abstract = {{Black-tailed prairie dogs are herbivorous rodents known to have large
   effects on grassland landscapes in North America. They have considerable
   impacts on prairie plant communities as the result of repeated clipping
   of vegetation that can reduce preferred forage species and may
   indirectly result in increased abundance of disturbance-tolerant
   species. We investigated plant communities within three different
   habitat types: Active- and inactive prairie dog colonies, and adjacent
   suitable, but unoccupied, control areas in the Northern Great Plains of
   Montana, U.SA. Plant species richness did not vary markedly between the
   three habitat types. However, plant composition measured as cover of
   plant life forms (forbs, shrubs, and graminoids), which was further
   divided into native status (native or introduced), and plant species
   indicators (plant species associated with a specific habitat) did vary
   distinctly between the three habitat types. Differences in plant
   composition between the habitat types suggests black-tailed prairie dog
   activities result in greater diversity of plant microhabitats at a
   landscape scale, and prairie dogs are an important component of the
   overall ecosystem in the Northern Great Plains of North America.}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Animal production systems are increasingly required to co-produce meat
   products and other ecosystem services. Sown biodiverse pastures (SBP)
   were developed in Portugal as an improvement over semi-natural pastures
   (SNP). SBP increase yields and animal intake during grazing, are
   substantial carbon sinks, and the abundance of legumes in the mixtures
   provides plants with a biological source of nitrogen. However, the data
   available and the data demands of most models make integrated modelling
   of these effects difficult. Here, we developed BalSim, a mass balance
   approach for the estimation of carbon and nitrogen flows and the direct
   greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of the two production systems. Results show
   that, on average, the on-farm GHG balance is -2.6 and 0.8 t CO(2)e/ha.yr
   for SBP and SNP, respectively. Ignoring the effects of carbon
   sequestration, and taking into account only non-CO2 emissions, the
   systems are responsible for 17.0 and 16.3 kg CO(2)e/kg live weight.yr.
   The annual analysis showed that non-CO2 emissions were highest in a
   drought year due to decreased yield and stocking rate. We also showed
   through scenario analysis that matching the grazing level to the yield
   is crucial to minimize emissions and ensure reduced feed supplementation
   while maintaining high soil carbon stocks.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Declines in native bee populations can limit pollination services that
   support native plant communities and global food production. Mitigating
   the impacts on pollinators and ecosystems requires conservation actions
   that promote biodiversity and remain practical for producers. We
   investigated plantpollinator interaction networks in working grassland
   landscapes, managed for cattle production and biodiversity, to advance
   conservation of pollinators in grazed systems. We compared and plotted
   interactions at the network level. We then used a regression framework
   to evaluate the influence of floristic availability on pollinator
   abundance in our system. Overall, we detected seasonal shifts at the
   network level, with increased specialization between flowers and bees
   occurring at the end of the sampling season. Furthermore, the response
   to floristic resources differed between honey bees (Apis mellifera) and
   native bees. While honey bee abundance increased with exotic floral
   abundance, native bee abundance showed no relationship with floral
   abundance and instead was positively associated with floral richness in
   our system. These findings could be an indication of seasonal shifts in
   bee activity and interactions with plants or a response to the subset of
   available resources in grazed systems. These interpretations, along with
   the detected difference in resource use between honey bees and native
   bees, suggest foraging preferences differ between these two groups and
   could influence conservation and management strategies. Furthermore, it
   demonstrates a need to consider how management practices could influence
   bee communities differentially across the growing season and suggests
   conservation actions should promote native floristic resources to
   benefit native bees.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland birds are declining faster than any other guild of birds in
   North America, in part because of degradation of their breeding habitat.
   Rangeland managers recommend increasing heterogeneity to improve
   biodiversity; however, on privately owned rangelands, beef production
   likely decreases heterogeneity on the landscape. One suggestion has been
   to use multiple grazing systems across a landscape to increase
   heterogeneity and provide benefits for avian biodiversity, but there is
   little research to support this recommendation. Thus, our goal was to
   examine heterogeneity and songbird abundance in relation to grazing
   systems used by private producers in a large, intact rangeland region.
   We measured vegetation structure and conducted avian surveys in the
   Nebraska Sandhills on 11 management units with five different grazing
   systems, including season-long continuous, deferred rotation, management
   intensive, dormant season only, and a fixed rotation. On each management
   unit we assessed the relationship between vegetation structure or
   songbird abundance and potential management effects, such as grazing
   system, stocking rate, and management intensity. Season of use and
   stocking rate were the most common sources of variation in vegetation
   structure and songbird abundance. Grazing system did not explain
   variation in vegetation structure or bird abundance, except for
   heterogeneity in live grass cover, litter cover, shrub cover, and
   abundance of field sparrows. Vegetation structure varied across the
   landscape we sampled, but the range of heterogeneity was narrow. Thus,
   managers should not assume that using a variety of grazing systems
   across a landscape will inevitably result in heterogeneity of vegetation
   structure. Rather, managers should focus on creating contrasting
   vegetation structure in large areas to increase large-scale
   heterogeneity. This may be achieved through the application of more
   extreme management practices (e.g., long-term heavy grazing and
   long-term rest or patch-burn grazing) so that a wider variety of
   vegetation composition and structure is available to support
   biodiversity. (C) 2018 The Society for Range Management. Published by

Abstract = {{Rangelands and the wildlife and livestock they support are critical to
   human livelihoods, but rangeland ecosystems increasingly suffer from
   overgrazing and degradation. Planned grazing, a strategy that commonly
   involves Lime-controlled rotations of high-density (bunched) groups of
   cattle across pasture, is marketed as a method to enhance rangeland
   health and lessen livestock impacts. However, the behavioral mechanisms
   underlying any potential rangeland improvements resulting from
   rotational, high-density planned grazing have rarely been examined. To
   investigate these mechanisms, we compared planned grazing with
   conventional continuous grazing management in a savanna ecosystem in
   Kenya. We surveyed cattle grazing behavior, measured changes in
   vegetation characteristics through surveys conducted before and after
   cattle grazing, and measured native ungulate abundance following grazing
   using camera traps. Stocking rates were held constant across treatments,
   resulting in a commensurate decline in total foliar hits per pin (a
   proxy for vegetative biomass) across treatments. Planned grazing
   management altered cattle behavior and reduced grazing selectivity by
   restricting movements, causing cattle to walk more slowly while grazing
   and to take more bites per step. Vegetation survey results supported
   this finding: cattle in the planned grazing treatment ate significantly
   more Pennisetum grasses (typically avoided because of their
   unpalatability), creating the opportunity for regrowth of more palatable
   species after seasonal rains. We also documented significantly higher
   zebra presence in planned grazing plots after cattle grazing, likely due
   to increased relative abundance of more palatable grass species. This
   investigation of grazing behavior, and specifically decreased grazing
   selectivity as a mechanism underpinning the benefits of planned grazing,
   shows that when conducted at appropriate stocking densities, planned
   grazing has the potential to help mitigate rangeland degradation and
   improve rangeland sustainability for both livestock and wildlife in
   pastoral African savanna ecosystems. (C) 2018 The Society for Range

Abstract = {{This study addresses the question of how changing the mowing regime
   influences the floristic composition and floristic diversity of grasses
   in an experimental lowland meadow. The study location is Bialowieza
   Forest, NE Poland. To achieve the aim we used phytosociological data
   from long-term studies in Bialowieza Forest on the course of secondary
   succession. The relationship between the biodiversity of grasses and
   type of mowing was determined using statistical analysis. Changes in the
   dominance and frequency of individual grass species have occurred during
   the last 28 years of observations. The analysis of floristic similarity
   demonstrated a turnover of species between the individual years of
   observation. Principal component analysis showed that the change in
   mowing method resulted in a change of the species composition, cover,
   and domination. However, differences in the intensity of disturbance
   level were rather small (one cut yearly by scythe, by sickle bar mower,
   and by trimmer), and changes in floristic composition were also moderate
   in most years. During the initial years (1984-1990), Dactylis glomerata,
   Agrostis gigantea, and Anthoxanthum odoratum dominated. After 1990,
   Arrhenatherum elatius and Holcus lanatus spread and took over, with
   Trisetum flavescens joining them later. Between 2008 and 2012 the cover
   of Dactylis glomerata increased more than two times. The reasons for the
   floristic transformations were changes in the management mode, e. g.,
   the transition from mowing by scythe (medium disturbance) to mechanized
   mowing, first by sickle bar mower (strong disturbance) and then by
   trimmer (weak disturbance).}},

Abstract = {{Mixtures composed of species with different growth strategies (e.g.,
   exploitative and conservative), which have different abilities for
   resource capture and use, are thought to improve grassland ecosystem
   services. However, plant species that compete better for limiting
   resources can become dominant. This study examined whether potential
   dominant perennial grasses with different growth strategies can compose
   productive and stable forage mixtures under low competition for
   resources (nutrients and light). Arrhenatherum elatius L.
   (exploitative), Festuca arundinacea Schreb. (conservative), and Dactylis
   glomerata L. (moderately exploitative) were sowed as monocultures and as
   a three-species mixture. Pastures were fertilized to maintain high soil
   fertility levels and mowed by half when their canopies reached 20 cm in
   height (95\% of light interception in the vegetative stage) allowing for
   over 2 yr of data collection. The proportion of each species in the
   mixture remained unaltered throughout the experimental period.
   Transgressive overyielding was not observed; however, the mixture
   presented a similar yield to the most productive monocultures (10,200 kg
   DM ha(-1) yr(-1)), although D. glomerata, which presented the lowest
   yield in monoculture (6400 kg DM ha(-1) yr(-1)), comprised 68.1\% of
   post-cutting biomass in the mixture. Arrhenatherum elatius and F.
   arundinacea populations presented less yield variance in monoculture,
   but higher yield stability was observed in the mixture. Overyielding in
   the three studied species was strongly affected by leaf production.
   Mixtures composed of perennial grasses with different growth strategies
   when grown in nutrient-rich soil and under conditions of low light
   competition can compose productive and stable swards, while maximizing
   leaf production.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and plants are
   sensitive to a myriad of underlying factors, including soil chemistry
   and land-use disturbances. Here we address how two grassland ecosystems
   (Ozark glades vs. tallgrass prairies) in south-central USA have been
   impacted by legacy effects from land-use disturbances (e.g., fire
   suppression in glades and tillage, fertilizer, row cropping, and grazing
   in prairies) and geological substrate (acidic versus calcareous
   bedrock). We surveyed AMF on the roots of two native generalist host
   species {[}Ruellia humilis Nutt. and Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.)
   Nash] as well as plants randomly selected from the plant community.
   Glades on calcareous bedrock had a higher pH than those on acidic
   bedrock, and AMF communities on all three root sample types varied
   between acidic and calcareous bedrock locations. In prairies, both
   bedrock types had a similar soil pH, and AMF communities on all three
   root sample types varied across remnant and disturbed prairies. Shifts
   in AMF composition across land-use history included shifts in dominant
   AMF genera, and some unique rare AMF taxa were restricted to only
   calcareous glades or remnant prairies. Our findings suggest that
   reseeding prairie plant communities on cultivated lands does not restore
   AMF communities. Restoration projects need to address the soil

Abstract = {{Large-scale losses of seagrass areas have been associated with
   eutrophication events, which have led to an overproduction of
   photosynthetic organisms including epiphytes. Grazers that feed on
   epiphytes can exert a significant top-down control in the system, but
   the effects of physical factors on grazing activity and feeding
   behaviour have been rarely examined. We addressed the combination of
   hydrodynamic regime and seagrass shoot density can alter the feeding and
   foraging behaviours of mesograzers. A full factorial experiment, with
   flow velocity (high, medium and low) and shoot density (high versus low)
   as main factors, was conducted in a racetrack flume using artificial
   seagrass plots. The results showed that when high flow velocity
   conditions were combined with low shoot density, consumption of
   epiphytes by mesograzers was strongly reduced. In contrast, when flow
   velocity was low or shoot density was high, mesograzers exhibited high
   feeding rates and vigorous swimming behaviour. These results clearly
   indicate that hydrodynamic stress reduces the time that mesograzers can
   spend feeding, since it inhibits their swimming behaviour, and thus
   indirectly affecting to the density of epiphytes. Therefore, the
   triggering of trophic cascade effects in seagrass communities under
   these experimental conditions depended on the interrelationship and
   feedbacks among shoot density, abiotic (flow velocity) and biotic
   (epiphytes and mesograzers) compartments, with flow velocity exerting a
   top-down control on seagrass ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities and climate change are key drivers of biodiversity loss
   in natural ecosystems. In particular, a growing body of evidence shows
   that grazing and altered precipitation patterns strongly affect
   grassland plant and insect diversity respectively, but their combined
   effects and impact on trophic interactions are largely unknown. In this
   study, a field experiment was conducted with different grazing
   intensities and irrigation to examine how plant diversity responds to
   variation in grazing and precipitation, which in turn influences the
   diversity of herbivores and predators in insect communities in a meadow
   steppe. Overall, grazing and irrigation increased plant biomass and
   decreased plant diversity, except for non-significant effects of
   irrigation treatments on plant diversity. Higher herbivore diversity in
   grazing treatments was mediated by plant diversity because path analysis
   revealed a positive relationship between plant and herbivore species
   richness. Increased predator diversity caused by grazing was mediated
   indirectly through changes in herbivore abundance. Our results indicate
   that plant-mediated changes in herbivore diversity are consistent with
   the Resource Diversity Hypothesis, whereas changes in predator diversity
   correspond with the More Individuals Hypothesis. Our findings highlight
   the importance of assessing both direct and indirect effects of grazing
   and irrigation on the diversity of guilds at different trophic levels
   within an insect community. Furthermore, understanding mechanistic
   responses to such changes could help us to better account for
   biodiversity loss in the context of grazing and altered precipitation
   patterns.}},

Abstract = {{Fire and grazing shape biodiversity in savannah landscapes. In land use
   management, knowing the effects of fire and grazing on biodiversity are
   important in order to ensure environmental sustainability. Beetles
   specifically are indicators of the biodiversity response to fire and
   grazing. A grazing exclusion and burning experiment in a split-plot
   design was used in order to investigate the interacting effects of fire
   and wildlife grazing on biomass, diversity, and species composition of
   darkling beetles (Coleoptera, Tenebrionidae) over time after fire.
   Darkling beetle species richness and diversity were responding in a
   three-way-interaction to fire, grazing, and time after fire, whereby
   biomass of darkling beetles remained unaffected and species
   compositional changes were attributed to seasonal changes of time only.
   Fire on ungrazed plots had a negative effect on species diversity and
   richness 2 weeks and 6 months post fire, whereas fire on grazed plots
   had no impact on species diversity and richness. Grazing only lowered
   species diversity and richness 6 months after fire treatments. Results
   suggest that grazing overrides the effects of fire and that the similar
   effects caused by fire and grazing are due to niche and assemblage
   simplification of the habitat.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial heterogeneity is a property of natural ecosystems. Integrated
   crop-livestock systems (ICLS) aim to mimic natural ecosystem functions
   as pillars of sustainable intensification, and grazing is a process that
   potentially affects spatial heterogeneity. Then, we investigated the
   effect of different grazing intensities, defined according to a range of
   sward heights (intensive grazing, 10 cm; moderate grazing, 20 cm;
   moderate-light grazing, 30 cm; light grazing, 40 cm; and ungrazed), on
   the spatial heterogeneity and biomass productivity of mixed Italian
   ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and black oat (Avena strigosa
   Schreb.) pastures. The mixture was grazed by steers under continuous
   variable stocking, using put-and-take animals to maintain targeted sward
   heights. The pasture was in rotation with soybean in an integrated
   crop-livestock system for 15 years. Data concerns pasture phase on the
   15th rotation cycle. Cattle grazing at moderate to light intensities
   increased pasture spatial heterogeneity and total aboveground primary
   productivity, while intensive grazing led to homogeneous overgrazed
   canopies with frequent bare soil patches. Pre-grazing sward structure
   suggests that the summer crop rotation buffers the contrasts created by
   grazing at different intensities. This study suggests that moderate to
   light grazing intensities increase pasture productive efficiency and
   create more heterogeneous canopies in ICLS, while intensive grazing
   should be avoided.}},

Journal = {{GRASSLAND SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{65}},

Pages = {{60-68}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Grazing and clipping defoliation are the most important human
   disturbances in natural grasslands. Compensatory growth is a common
   response to clipping defoliation, which is of great significance for
   forage production and livestock husbandry development. However, how
   clipping intensity affects plant compensatory growth and how nitrogen
   (N) addition regulates this response in alpine ecosystems are still
   unclear. A manipulative experiment including two clipping intensities
   (light and heavy) crossed with N addition was conducted in an alpine
   meadow ecosystem to examine the effects of how N addition regulated
   plant compensatory growth induced by clipping defoliation. Selective
   clipping was used to simulate animal feeding, that is, only grasses and
   sedges were clipped. Under the N addition treatment, the relative growth
   rate of grasses and total biomass after clipping were significantly
   higher than those under the no N addition treatment. The total community
   biomass showed over-compensatory growth in light clipping under N
   addition treatment, while it showed equal-compensatory growth under the
   other treatments. The over-compensatory growth in light clipping under
   the N addition treatments mainly resulted from the stimulated growth of
   grasses. Regression analysis showed that the relative growth rate and
   biomass of grasses were positively correlated with soil inorganic N
   content, but increasing N availability was not conducive to the growth
   of sedges and other forbs. Divergent responses of different plant
   functional groups to clipping and N addition would lead to changes in
   community structure and functioning. Both community biomass and
   compensatory growth tended to increase first and then reach a stable
   state with the increase in soil N availability. Our results show that
   although light clipping could largely stimulate forage production under
   N addition, excessive clipping cannot lead to a continuous increase in
   compensatory growth of plant biomass, even under N addition conditions,
   in this semiarid alpine meadow ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland recovery from degradation is increasingly occurring worldwide.
   Diverse managements have been considered as effective ways to restore
   degraded grassland, but it remains unclear how semi-arid grasslands
   respond to long-term grazing exclusion and fenced mowing. Here, a study
   was conducted under open grazing, grazing exclusion and fenced mowing in
   a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau. We measured plant species
   composition and diversity, plant production, surface litter and soil
   water and carbon content. Shifts in grassland management led to
   significant divergence in plant community composition. Long-term grazing
   exclusion (35 years) significantly increased plant biomass, surface
   litter, soil water and carbon storage, but suppressed plant diversity
   compared to open grazing. Conversely, fenced mowing significantly
   increased plant diversity accompanying with a weak effect on soil
   carbon. Moreover, mowing significantly reduced surface litter and soil
   moisture, which have strong implications for nutrient depletion and soil
   drying. Our results suggest that introducing disturbances are necessary
   to safeguard biodiversity, and continuous mowing (5 years) belongs to
   over exploitation of the long-term protected grassland. Therefore, it is
   essential to optimize management with dual objectives of biodiversity
   and soil carbon sequestration in the future.}},

Title = {{The impact of cattle dung pats on earthworm distribution in grazed
   pastures}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundGrazed grassland management regimes can have various effects
   on soil fauna. For example, effects on earthworms can be negative
   through compaction induced by grazing animals, or positive mediated by
   increases in sward productivity and cattle dung pats providing a food
   source. Knowledge gaps exist in relation to the behaviour of different
   earthworm species i.e. their movement towards and aggregation under dung
   pats, the legacy effects of pats and the spatial area of recruitment.
   The present study addressed these knowledge gaps in field experiments,
   over 2years, using natural and simulated dung pats on two permanent,
   intensively grazed pastures in Ireland.ResultsDung pats strongly
   affected spatial earthworm distribution, with up to four times more
   earthworms aggregating beneath pats, than in the control locations away
   from pats. In these earthworm communities comprising 11 species,
   temporally different aggregation and dispersal patterns were observed,
   including absence of individual species from control locations, but no
   clear successional responses. Epigeic species in general, but also
   certain species of the anecic and endogeic groups were aggregating under
   dung. Sampling after complete dung pat disappearance (27weeks after
   application) suggested an absence of a dung pat legacy effect on
   earthworm communities. Based on species distributions, the maximum size
   of the recruitment area from which earthworms moved to pats was
   estimated to be 3.8m(2) per dung pat. Since actual grazing over 6weeks
   would result in the deposition of about 300 dung pats per ha, it is
   estimated that a surface area of 1140m(2) or about 11\% of the total
   grazing area can be influenced by dung pats in a given grazing
   period.ConclusionsThis study showed that the presence of dung pats in
   pastures creates temporary hot spots in spatial earthworm species
   distribution, which changes over time. The findings highlight the
   importance of considering dung pats, temporally and spatially, when
   sampling earthworms in grazed pastures. Published comparisons of grazed
   and cut grasslands probably reached incorrect conclusions by ignoring or
   deliberately avoiding dung pats. Furthermore, the observed intense
   aggregation of earthworms beneath dung pats suggests that earthworm
   functions need to be assessed separately at these hot spots.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{263}},
Pages = {{188-197}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Although studies have investigated the independent effects of warming,
   snow, and grazing on alpine plant community properties - including plant
   species richness, evenness, and diversity - the interactive effects of
   these climate and grazing factors have not been addressed experimentally
   in cold systems. We investigate the effects of these climate change and
   grazing factors using 5 years of data collected from a relatively
   long-term (2009-2015), fully-factorial field experiment in an alpine
   meadow ecosystem on the central Tibetan Plateau. Specifically, we
   investigate: 1) how experimental warming, spring snow addition, and yak
   grazing independently and interactively affect plant community
   properties, including diversity metrics and relative contributions of
   different plant life forms to the total plant cover, and 2) how the
   changes in plant community properties are associated with the
   proportional cover of the dominant plant species, Kobresia pygmaea
   within the total vegetation cover. We found that warming reduced species
   richness and increased species evenness and the proportional cover of
   shrubs within the total vegetation cover. Snow addition also increased
   species evenness. Grazing increased the proportional cover of K. pygmaea
   within the total vegetation cover, while decreasing that of grasses.
   Grazing also counteracted warming-induced increases in shrubs.
   Treatment-induced changes in K. pygmaea cover were strongly correlated
   with the indices of plant community properties and were generally in the
   opposite direction of changes in species evenness and diversity. We
   conclude that the projected increases in spring snowstorms and
   maintaining moderate levels of grazing can counteract some warming
   effects on the plant community. Moreover, the performance of the
   dominant species can regulate plant community responses to climate
   change and livestock grazing on the central Tibetan Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate semi-natural grasslands in Europe and East Asia have been
   rapidly declining and their conservation is urgently required. Although
   recent studies have indicated the importance of clear-cuts as
   alternative habitats for grassland butterflies, there is paucity of
   studies that directly compare biodiversity and habitat quality between
   grasslands and clear-cuts using multiple taxa. In this study, we
   compared the plant and butterfly richness between grasslands and
   clear-cuts, with a focus on the distribution of butterfly resources
   (nectaring flowers and host plants) and endangered plant and butterfly
   species, in a cool temperate area of central Japan. We established three
   or six transects in five grassland and five clear-cut sites, and
   measured the richness of plants and butterflies and environmental
   variables such as vegetation height and coverage at both transect and
   site levels. At the site level, there were no differences in the
   richness of all plants, butterflies, and butterfly host plants, but
   there were significant or marginal differences in the richness of
   endangered plants, butterflies, and butterfly host plants. Almost all
   endangered plants and butterflies were found in the overall grasslands,
   but only half of the endangered butterfly species were observed in the
   overall clear-cuts. At the transect level, species richness of
   endangered plants and butterflies peaked at an intermediate vegetation
   height. Our results indicate the primary importance of existing
   semi-natural grasslands and the necessity of management when the
   vegetation becomes too high. We recommend active creation of clear-cuts
   near or between the existing grasslands, so that clear-cuts can provide
   source or backup populations and act as stepping stones to connect the
   isolated grassland populations.}},

Title = {{Productivity and Quality of Alpine Grassland Vary With Soil Water
   Availability Under Experimental Warming}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{The plant productivity of alpine meadow is predicted to generally
   increase under a warming climate, but it remains unclear whether the
   positive response rates will vary with soil water availability. Without
   consideration of the response of community composition and plant
   quality, livestock grazing under the current stocking rate might still
   lead to grassland degradation, even in meadows with high plant biomass.
   We have conducted a warming experiment from 2010 to 2017 to examine the
   interactive effects of warming and soil water availability on plant
   growth and forage quality at individual and functional group levels in
   an alpine meadow located in the permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibetan
   Plateau. Warming-induced changes in community composition, biomass, and
   forage quality varied with soil water availability. Under dry
   conditions, experimental warming reduced the relative importance of
   grasses and the aboveground biomass by 32.37 g m(-2) but increased the
   importance value of forbs. It also increased the crude fat by 0.68\% and
   the crude protein by 3.19\% at the end of summer but decreased the acid
   detergent fiber by 5.59\% at the end of spring. The increase in crude
   fat and protein and the decrease in acid detergent fiber, but the
   decrease in aboveground biomass and increase the importance value of
   forbs, which may imply a deterioration of the grassland. Under wet
   conditions, warming increased aboveground biomass by 29.49 g m(-2) at
   the end of spring and reduced acid detergent fiber by 8.09\% at the end
   of summer. The importance value of grasses and forbs positively
   correlated with the acid detergent fiber and crude protein,
   respectively. Our results suggest that precipitation changes will
   determine whether climate warming will benefit rangelands on the
   Qinghai- Tibetan Plateau, with drier conditions suppressing grassland
   productivity, but wetter conditions increasing production while
   preserving forage quality.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{BackgroundGlobal climate change is projected to increase temperature and
   alter precipitation pattern, which could affect grassland ecosystem.
   Long-term observation at a field experiment can be a powerful approach
   to explore the impacts of climate change on biomass productivity in
   grassland. In attempting to understand how climatic variability
   regulates biomass productivity, we analyzed long-term records of
   temperature and precipitation to examine how variation of temperature
   and precipitation across 19years affect biomass productivity.MethodsWe
   established the experiment with 64 plots in two blocks and planted 31
   species in 30 different mixtures. We harvested aboveground biomass twice
   a year, sorted biomass by functional groups, and weighed dry biomass.
   The site was mown after each harvest. We did not apply any fertilizer
   and water. Using linear regression model, we examined the influences of
   growing season temperature and precipitation on biomass
   productivity.ResultsThe results showed that aboveground biomass
   productivity in September and annual were significantly increased in
   post-drought (2003-2015). The relationships of aboveground biomass
   productivity with growing season precipitation were significantly
   positive. The results showed that aboveground biomass productivity in
   June and annual were sensitive to growing season temperature. The
   relationships of aboveground biomass productivity of the functional
   group of grasses with early growing season temperature were
   significantly negative. Early growing season precipitation had a
   significant positive effect on aboveground biomass productivity of the
   functional groups of grasses and legumes. Post-drought aboveground
   biomass productivity of the functional groups of grasses in June and
   September were declined, whereas legumes significantly increased, which
   suggests that the role of dominant grasses may shift by legumes with
   global climate change.ConclusionsOur results highlight that early and
   late growing temperature and precipitation variability may reduce the
   aboveground biomass productivity in grassland. Our study implies that
   the combination of several functional groups is essential for the
   maintenance of stable productivity in temperate grassland ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Trophic rewilding-the (re) introduction of missing large herbivores
   and/or their predators-is increasingly proposed to restore biodiversity
   and biotic interactions, but its effects on soils have been largely
   neglected. The high diversity of soil organisms and the ecological
   functions they perform mean that the full impact of rewilding on
   ecosystems cannot be assessed considering only above-ground food webs.
   Here we outline current understanding on how animal species of rewilding
   interest affect soil structure, processes and communities, and how in
   turn soil biota may affect species above ground. We highlight
   considerable uncertainty in soil responses to and feedbacks on
   above-ground consumers, with potentially large implications for
   rewilding interactions with global change. For example, the impact of
   large herbivores on soil decomposers and plant-soil interactions could
   lead to reduced carbon sequestration, whereas herbivore interactions
   with keystone biota such as mycorrhizal fungi, dung beetles and
   bioturbators could promote native plants and ecosystem heterogeneity.
   Moreover, (re) inoculation of keystone soil biota could be considered as
   a strategy to meet some of the objectives of trophic rewilding. Overall,
   we call for the rewilding research community to engage more with soil
   ecology experts and consider above-ground-below-ground linkages as
   integral to assess potential benefits as well as pitfalls.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are among the most imperilled biomes of the world.
   Identifying the most appropriate framework for restoring grasslands is
   dependent on the objectives of restoration, which is inherently
   determined by human priorities. Debates over the appropriate
   conservation model for grasslands have often focused on which species of
   herbivores should be the focus of restoration efforts. Here we discuss
   three perspectives of herbivore-based conservation in North American
   grasslands. First, the Pleistocene rewilding perspective is based upon
   the idea that early humans contributed to the demise of megafauna that
   were important to the evolution and development of many of North
   America's grasslands; therefore, their aim of restoration is rewilding
   of landscapes to pre-human times. Second, the bison rewilding
   perspective considers American bison a keystone herbivore that is
   culturally and ecologically important to North American grasslands. A
   third perspective focuses on restoring the pattern and processes of
   herbivory on grasslands and is less concerned about which herbivore is
   introduced to the landscape. We evaluate each of these three
   conservation perspectives in terms of a framework that includes a human
   domain, an herbivore domain and a biophysical domain. While all
   conservation perspectives partly address the three domains, they all
   fall short in key areas. Specifically, they fail to recognize that past,
   current and future humans are intimately linked to grassland patterns
   and processes and will continue to play a role in structuring
   grasslands. Furthermore, these perspectives seem to only superficially
   consider the role of fragmentation and climate change in influencing
   grassland patterns and processes. As such, we argue that future
   grassland conservation efforts must depend on the development of a model
   that better integrates societal, economic and policy objectives and
   recognizes climate change, fragmentation and humans as an integral part
   of these ecosystems.

Abstract = {{Trophic rewilding is a restoration strategy focusing on the restoration
   of trophic interactions to promote self-regulating, biodiverse
   ecosystems. It has been proposed as an alternative to traditional
   conservation management in abandoned or defaunated areas. Arthropods
   constitute the most speciesrich group of eukaryotic organisms, but are
   rarely considered in rewilding. Here, we first present an overview of
   direct and indirect pathways by which large herbivores and predators
   affect arthropod communities. We then review the published evidence of
   the impacts of rewilding with large herbivores on arthropods, including
   grey literature. We find that systematic monitoring is rare and that a
   comparison with a relevant control treatment is usually lacking.
   Nevertheless, the available data suggest that when the important process
   of top-down control of large-herbivore populations is missing, arthropod
   diversity tends to decrease. To ensure that rewilding is supportive of
   biodiversity conservation, we propose that if natural processes can only
   partially be restored, substitutes for missing processes are applied. We
   also propose that boundaries of acceptable outcomes of rewilding actions
   should be defined a priori, particularly concerning biodiversity
   conservation, and that action is taken when these boundaries are
   transgressed. To evaluate the success of rewilding for biodiversity,
   monitoring of arthropod communities should be a key instrument.

Abstract = {{Ecosystem engineers can increase biodiversity by creating novel habitat
   supporting species that would otherwise be absent. Their more routine
   activities further influence the biota occupying engineered habitats.
   Beavers are well-known for transforming ecosystems through dam building
   and are therefore increasingly being used for habitat restoration,
   adaptation to climate extremes and in long-term rewilding. Abandoned
   beaver ponds (BP) develop into meadows or forested wetlands that differ
   fundamentally from other terrestrial habitats and thus increase
   landscape diversity. Active BP, by contrast, are superficially similar
   to other non-engineered shallow wetlands, but ongoing use and
   maintenance might affect how BP contribute to aquatic biodiversity. We
   explored the `within-habitat' effect of an ecosystem engineer by
   comparing active BP in southern Sweden with coexisting other wetlands
   (OW), using sedentary (plants) and mobile (water beetles) organisms as
   indicators. BP differed predictably from OW in environmental
   characteristics and were more heterogeneous. BP supported more plant
   species at plot (+15\%) and site (+33\%) scales, and plant beta
   diversity, based on turnover between plots, was 17\% higher than in OW,
   contributing to a significantly larger species pool in BP (+17\%).
   Beetles were not differentiated between BP and OW based on diversity
   measures but were 26\% more abundant in BP. Independent of habitat
   creation beaver are thus significant agents of within-habitat
   heterogeneity that differentiates BP from other standing water habitat;
   as an integral component of the rewilding of wetlands re-establishing
   beaver should benefit aquatic biodiversity across multiple scales.}},

Abstract = {{Species richness remains one of the most valuable type of information
   for biodiversity conservation. Here, we report a plant richness record
   in the Brazilian Pampa. We found 56 vascular plant species in a single
   plot of 1x1m in a privately owned grazed grassland in a region with
   shallow soils. This number is considerably higher than common species
   numbers in similar surveys and highlights the high plant diversity in
   South Brazilian grasslands. We take our record as an opportunity to
   reflect on some issues of high importance if we wish to reach
   conservation goals: much of the biodiversity is inside private lands,
   and these should be more in the focus of conservation efforts; field
   research, especially quantitative sampling, continues to be essential to
   improve knowledge on biodiversity and its distribution patterns;
   training biologists to be able to carry out biodiversity assessments and
   to interpret the results should be a key issue for universities. We hope
   that the communication of this record will encourage new scientific
   discoveries and raise social interest about the conservation of
   grasslands in South Brazil.}},

Abstract = {{Species composition plays a critical role in environmental conservation,

   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. We found that 1) there were significant linear
   relationships of widely used species composition indices between this
   and traditional methods (P < 0.01); 2) along increasing grazing density,
   there were similar tendencies of these indices estimated by the two
   methods; 3) the new method was more representative than the traditional
   one though some specific species were difficult to identify. We
   concluded that this method is suitable for long-term repeated monitoring
   of grassland species composition, which will be useful for grassland

Journal = {{FOLIA GEOBOTANICA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{365-376}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Although plant-plant interactions and their effects on ecological
   functioning have been examined in communities composed of different
   functional groups, they have rarely been studied in communities that
   contained a single functional group. We established a five-year
   experiment using three grass species with different nutrient addition
   and mowing treatments to explore overyielding and species interactions.
   We found strong overyielding caused by trait-independent complementarity
   effects. Nutrient addition increased overyielding via increasing
   trait-independent complementarity effects whereas mowing eliminated
   overyielding. One possible mechanism underlying the responses observed
   is the changes of positive aboveground species interactions. This result
   is consistent with the considerable literature identifying facilitation
   in alpine ecosystems by which coexisting plant species improve the
   microclimate and thereby promote the performance of all species.
   Complimentary resource use and selection effect have been demonstrated
   frequently as the mechanisms driving overyielding in grasslands.
   However, as we identify here, and positive interactions may be
   especially important in driving overyielding and positive interactions
   may be especially important in stressful environments such as alpine
   grasslands.}},

Journal = {{SUSTAINABILITY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As national policy implementers and regional development planners, local
   government managers have a clearer, more objective and comprehensive
   understanding of ecological changes than herdsmen. Thus, they have a
   significant impact on the sustainable development of grassland resources
   and agricultural and pastoral areas. In this paper, grassland ecological
   change and related factors in different stages were investigated by
   means of questionnaires and structured interviews, and the adjustment
   strategies of grazing prohibition policy were studied. The perception of
   local government managers was that there was an improvement in grassland
   ecology, coverage, quality, yield, and in species richness in the early
   grazing prohibition period. There was, furthermore, an obvious
   improvement in the intermediate stage and a significant improvement with
   some degradation in its current stage. The grazing prohibition policy
   urgently needs to be adjusted according to the management pattern and to
   the limited time and space. It is necessary to improve the standard of
   ecological compensation and bolster herdsmen livelihoods,
   diversification, and non-agriculturalization. Based on the
   non-equilibrium theory and polycentric governance, the multi-central
   grassland governance and control system should be created in future.}},

   Review}},
Journal = {{AGRONOMY-BASEL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Adoption of better management practices is crucial to lessen the impact
   of anthropogenic disturbances on tallgrass prairie systems that
   contribute heavily for livestock production in several states of the
   United States. This article reviews the impacts of different common
   management practices and disturbances (e.g., fertilization, grazing,
   burning) and tallgrass prairie restoration on plant growth and
   development, plant species composition, water and nutrient cycles, and
   microbial activities in tallgrass prairie. Although nitrogen (N)
   fertilization increases aboveground productivity of prairie systems,
   several factors greatly influence the range of stimulation across sites.
   For example, response to N fertilization was more evident on frequently
   or annually burnt sites (N limiting) than infrequently burnt and unburnt
   sites (light limiting). Frequent burning increased density of C-4
   grasses and decreased plant species richness and diversity, while plant
   diversity was maximized under infrequent burning and grazing. Grazing
   increased diversity and richness of native plant species by reducing
   aboveground biomass of dominant grasses and increasing light
   availability for other species. Restored prairies showed lower levels of
   species richness and soil quality compared to native remnants.
   Infrequent burning, regular grazing, and additional inputs can promote
   species richness and soil quality in restored prairies. However, this
   literature review indicated that all prairie systems might not show
   similar responses to treatments as the response might be influenced by
   another treatment, timing of treatments, and duration of treatments
   (i.e., short-term vs. long-term). Thus, it is necessary to examine the
   long-term responses of tallgrass prairie systems to main and interacting
   effects of combination of management practices under diverse plant
   community and climatic conditions for a holistic assessment.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{163-174}},

Abstract = {{Common practices for invasive species control and management include
   physical, chemical, and biological approaches. The first two approaches
   have clear limitations and may lead to unintended (negative)
   consequences, unless carefully planned and implemented. For example,
   physical removal rarely completely eradicates the targeted invasive
   species and can cause disturbances that facilitate new invasions by
   nonnative species from nearby habitats. Chemical treatments can harm
   native, and especially rare, species through unanticipated side effects.
   Biological methods may be classified as biocontrol and the ecological
   approach. Similar to physical and chemical methods, biocontrol also has
   limitations and sometimes leads to unintended consequences. Therefore, a
   relatively safer and more practical choice may be the ecological
   approach, which has two major components: (1) restoration of native
   species and (2) biomass manipulation of the restored community, such as
   selective grazing or prescribed burning (to achieve and maintain viable
   population sizes). Restoration requires well-planned and implemented
   planting designs that consider alpha-, beta-, and gamma-diversity and
   the abundance of native and invasive component species at local,
   landscape, and regional levels. Given the extensive destruction or
   degradation of natural habitats around the world, restoration could be
   most effective for enhancing ecosystem resilience and resistance to
   biotic invasions. At the same time, ecosystems in human-dominated
   landscapes, especially those newly restored, require close monitoring
   and careful intervention (e.g., through biomass manipulation),
   especially when successional trajectories are not moving as intended.
   Biomass management frequently uses prescribed burning, grazing,
   harvesting, and thinning to maintain overall ecosystem health and
   sustainability. Thus, the resulting optimal, balanced, and relatively
   stable ecological conditions could more effectively limit the spread and
   establishment of invasive species. Here we review the literature
   (especially within the last decade) on ecological approaches that
   involve biodiversity, biomass, and productivity, three key
   community/ecosystem variables that reciprocally influence one another.
   We focus on the common and most feasible ecological practices that can
   aid in resisting new invasions and/or suppressing the dominance of
   existing invasive species. We contend that, because of the strong
   influences from neighboring areas (i.e., as exotic species pools), local
   restoration and management efforts in the future need to consider the
   regional context and projected climate changes.}},

Abstract = {{In the present article, a summary and analysis of literature published
   in Mexico on the removal and burial of dung by dung beetles, a primary
   function that represents an ecosystem service of great importance for
   livestock production, is presented. Studies from distinct ecosystems are
   examined, emphasizing the findings in livestock pastures with active
   grazing in several different states of Mexico. In addition, the
   unpublished results of the authors obtained in pastures across an
   altitudinal gradient in central Veracruz are presented for a dung
   exposure time of 24 hours. No significant differences were found in
   species richness among sites. However, differences were found in the
   dung removal rate; higher values were found at the sites with higher
   elevation and lower values at sites with lower elevation. The species
   with the highest biomass included the 3 largest species and small but
   very abundant species. Nocturnal tunnelers reincorporated the largest
   quantity of dung over the first 24 hours; in contrast, rollers only
   removed dung at the lowest areas of the gradient (< 250 m asl). However,
   much more information is still required regarding the capacity of the
   different functional groups and dung beetle species for dung burial in
   the livestock production zones of Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{Simple Summary Grazing activity is fundamental to natural grassland
   biodiversity preservation. Increasing summer aridity decreases the
   grassland pastoral value, negatively affecting animal morpho-functional
   features and production with detrimental effects on the extensive sheep
   farming sustainability. Since adipokines represent a link between a
   subject's energy availability and tissue metabolism, we investigated the
   presence and distribution of the system composed of the adipokine apelin
   and its receptor in the mammary gland of sheep during the period between
   maximum flowering and maximum dryness of the pasture, providing a group
   of sheep with food supplementation. This work represents a part of a
   wider study aimed to buffer the negative effects of increasing summer
   drought stress on farm income and to maintain the grassland
   biodiversity. Our findings improve the knowledge of apelin/receptor
   system function on the sheep mammary gland and this could be a useful
   tool in the farm management practices.
   Abstract Sheep are the most bred species in the Central Italy Apennine
   using the natural pastures as a trophic resource and grazing activity is
   fundamental to maintain the grassland biodiversity: this goal can be
   reached only ensuring an economical sustainability to the farmers. This
   study aimed to investigate the apelin/apelin receptor system in ovine
   mammary gland and to evaluate the differences induced by food
   supplementation, in order to shed light on this system function. A flock
   of 15 Comisana x Appenninica adult dry ewes were free to graze from June
   until pasture maximum flowering (MxF). From this period to pasture
   maximum dryness (MxD), in addition to grazing, the experimental group
   (Exp) was supplemented with 600 g/day/head of cereals. Apelin and apelin
   receptor were assessed by Real-Time PCR and immunohistochemistry on the
   mammary glands of subjects pertaining to MxF, MxD and Exp groups. They
   were detected in alveolar and ductal epithelial cells. The pasture
   maximum flowering group showed significant differences in apelin
   expression compared with experimental and MxD groups. Apelin receptor
   expression significantly differed among the three groups. The reduced
   apelin receptor expression and immunoreactivity levels during parenchyma
   involution enables us to hypothesize that apelin receptor plays a
   modulating role in the system control.}},

Abstract = {{Camera traps (CTs) are used for wildlife monitoring globally. How CTs
   are used in wildlife studies across Africa, however, remains unknown. We
   provide the first literature review of CT studies conducted across
   Africa, to describe where, to what end, and by whom CTs are used, and to
   identify apparent gaps in the use of CTs. We found 172 CT studies
   published across 60 scientific journals, conducted in 30 of 55 African
   countries from 2005 to 2017. Most studies were conducted over a single
   year/season (74\%) and primarily addressed habitat use/species
   distribution (43\%), species presence/richness (38.4\%), behaviour
   (35.5\%) or demographics (29.7\%). Most studies took place in forest
   (52\%), woodland (33\%) and grassland (33\%) habitat types, and focused
   on a single species (45.3\%). Carnivores were the most commonly studied
   species group (86\%), followed by large herbivores (58\%) and primates
   (38\%). Our results suggest that camera trapping is rapidly increasing
   in use across Africa and potentially driven by country-based economic
   factors; however, there is room for improvement. CTs could be expanded
   in use for studies on underrepresented taxa (i.e. small mammals,
   reptiles and birds), investigations of human-wildlife conflict and
   understudied ecoregions (i.e. Sahara Desert).}},

Abstract = {{The effects of management regimes on structural composition and
   diversity of seasonally inundated herbaceous communities were
   investigated in the Mkomazi National Park, Tanzania. Three sites were
   selected based on management regimes, that is ``fire-grazing{''} (FG),
   ``fire-no grazing{''} (FNG) and ``no fire-no grazing{''} (NFNG), and
   sampled in the 2015 wet season. The studied vegetation parameters
   resulted significantly different across the sites, with the exceptions
   of species abundance between NFNG versus FG and NFNG versus FNG sites
   and species evenness, which remained constant among sites. A
   significantly higher species richness, Shannon diversity Index, standing
   biomass and percentage vegetation cover was detected at FNG site, than
   in the other sites. No significant differences arose when comparing FG
   and NFNG sites. Although the responses we found may in part be caused by
   confounding underlying variables such as variation in soil type, soil
   moisture or elevation, the patterns found may contribute to a more
   general understanding of the effects of management regimes in seasonally
   inundated savannah, as well as to sound approaches in environmental
   conservation and management. However, further research is needed to

Abstract = {{Like any other Transylvanian village, Selistat is interesting to visit
   and study from the perspective of the unique rural landscape in Europe
   nowadays, including an old tourist attraction such as the fortified
   church, but also meadows, shrubs and forests very rich in species. Two
   checklists were drawn up for herbs and arthropods inhabiting the
   Selistat area, in Brasov County. The field survey took place in
   September 2017, at the time of mowing in the hay meadows. Plants were
   harvested by hand pulling and arthropods were collected with
   entomological net. Some biological material was determined on the field,
   other in laboratory. In order to create the general picture, we also
   considered the species mentioned on the Romanian-German informative
   panels located in the study area. Overall, 20 plant families (Apiaceae,
   Asteraceae, Balsaminaceae, Boraginaceae, Caprifoliaceae,
   Caryophyllaceae, Colchicaceae, Dipsacaceae, Equisetaceae, Fabaceae,
   Hypericaceae, Lamiaceae, Linaceae, Malvaceae, Orchidaceae,
   Plantaginaceae, Poaceae, Polygalaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rosaceae,
   Rubiaceae), five insect orders (Coleoptera, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera,
   Orthoptera, Neuroptera) and three spider species (Pardosa lugubris,
   Pisaura mirabilis, Salticus scenicus) were associated with Selistat
   biodiversity. The Asteraceae and Fabaceae for plants and Hemiptera for
   insects were found to be the leading taxa, with respect of number of
   species in the analyzed sample. All species are listed in an
   alphabetical order of the genera and species. This report brings a

Abstract = {{In recent years, the continued loss and fragmentation of steppe has
   caused decreased ecosystem functions and species losses in insect
   diversity. In the 2000s, the Chinese government developed a series of
   national projects, such as the construction of enclosures, to conserve
   natural ecosystems, including steppe. However, the effects of these
   enclosures on steppe arthropod community are largely unknown. In the
   present study, we selected enclosed and low-grazing regions at eight
   National Grassland Fixed Monitoring Stations to examine the
   compositional differences in four insect functional groups and their
   associated ecological functions. The results showed that diversity
   significantly differed between the enclosed and low-grazing regions,
   with the number of insect families being significantly higher in
   enclosed regions than in regions with low-grazing pressure. The
   responses of the insect community to steppe management also varied among
   the four groups (herbivores, predators, parasitoids, and pollinators).
   The abundances of herbivores, predators, and parasitoids were higher in
   enclosed regions than in low-grazing regions, while there was no
   significant difference in pollinators. Additionally, there were no
   significant differences in the predator/prey ratio between enclosed
   regions and low-grazing regions in any of the steppe types. The
   parasitic wasp/prey ratio was higher in enclosed regions than in
   low-grazing regions in meadow steppe and typical steppe, while there
   were no significant differences between the enclosed and low-grazing
   regions in desert steppe and steppe desert. Herbivores were observed to
   benefit much more from enclosures than predators, parasitoids, and
   pollinators. Therefore, we recommend low-grazing should be considered in
   steppe conservation, which could conserve biodiversity and achieve
   biocontrol functions of arthropod community.}},

Abstract = {{Groundwater-fed wet meadows and rich fens with low, open vegetation form
   the core habitats of rare Bog Turtles (Glyptemys muhlenbergii) in the
   northern part of their range in North America. Under current conditions,
   these habitats tend to become overgrown with taller vegetation in the
   absence of management. In agricultural and post-agricultural landscapes,
   managers sometimes use livestock grazing to improve and maintain habitat
   quality for Bog Turtles, despite insufficient knowledge about how
   specific practices affect both Bog Turtles and nontarget species. To
   further our understanding of such effects, we present results from a
   single wetland complex in New York, USA, which we managed primarily with
   cattle grazing over four and a half growing seasons. Management
   effectiveness was assessed by monitoring Bog Turtle nest placement,
   habitat use via radio tracking, and vegetation structure and composition
   change in permanent plots. Nest locations varied among years, with all
   nests placed in grazed or recently grazed areas. Individual turtles
   maintained, and in some cases expanded, their ranges in grazed areas
   during spring and summer, although they continued to avoid one (grazed)
   area with apparently unsuitable soils, and increasingly used cattle
   exclusion areas for fall and overwintering habitat. Plant species
   richness and the cover of native plants and fen-indicator plants
   increased in grazed areas, while cover of nonnative species did not.
   Grazing appeared to improve Bog Turtle habitat without negatively
   affecting fen and other wetland vegetation at this site, and we propose
   several specific management recommendations based on our results.}},

Title = {{Improving ground cover and landscape function in a semi-arid rangeland

Abstract = {{The development and adoption of sustainable grazing strategies is
   important to improve the functionality and productivity of agricultural
   landscapes. Alternative grazing systems incorporating periods of planned
   rest may achieve this compared to continuous grazing systems, but the
   evidence is conflicting. Using paired paddock contrasts, soil
   characteristics, ground cover and landscape function (i.e. soil
   stability, nutrient cycling, infiltration and landscape organisation
   indices) were compared between alternative grazing management
   (incorporating periods of rest), traditional (continuous) grazing, and
   areas managed for conservation (ungrazed by commercial livestock but
   grazed by native and feral herbivores) on contrasting soil types in
   semi-arid rangelands. Relationships between the response variables and
   understorey floristic biodiversity measures were also explored. Total
   ground cover was greater under conservation management than grazing, and
   was greater under alternative grazing than traditional grazing
   management. Indices of landscape function, including stability, nutrient
   cycling, patch area and landscape organisation were significantly
   greater, and interpatch length significantly shorter, under conservation
   compared to traditional grazing management. Alternative grazing
   management had intermediate values of landscape function which did not
   differ significantly to traditional grazing or conservation treatments.
   Ground cover and floristic biodiversity measures were often positively
   correlated, but there was no clear relationship between most landscape
   function and plant biodiversity indices. Landscape function may be
   important in detecting changes in rangelands that remain undetected by
   floristic diversity measures. Alternative grazing strategies
   incorporating planned rest have the potential to improve ground cover
   with the associated benefits of improved productivity and landscape
   function compared to continuous grazing regimes.}},

Title = {{Perception of livestock ecosystem services in grazing areas}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{2627-2638}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates how the ecosystem services (ES) linked to
   livestock grazing are perceived across countries. A total of 82 case
   studies collected from 42 countries via survey (53.7\% cases from Europe
   and 46.3\% from outside of Europe) have been analysed through a
   multivariate approach. In all, 18 non-provisioning ES were considered.
   Overall, the reported impacts of livestock grazing on the different ES
   were much more positive than negative. Notably, a large proportion of
   respondents reported either positive or very positive impacts for some
   cultural ES, namely cultural, historic and natural heritage (84\%),
   knowledge systems and educational values (77\%), landscape values
   (74\%), and for some supporting and regulating ES, namely habitat
   provision (66\%), nutrient cycling (65\%), and bush encroachment/fire
   control (66\%). Based on multiple regression analysis, geographic
   origin, stakeholder type and species category, as well as protection
   status of the grazing area, had significant effects on the perception of
   the impacts. Respondents reported those impacts as more positive in
   Europe, in protected areas and where several species were present in the
   grazing area. A significantly larger proportion of respondents reported
   recognition of ES provided by the grazing livestock population in
   European countries (40.9\%) compared with non-European countries
   (23.7\%). Based on the survey responses it appears that in non-European
   countries absence of formal recognition, especially by policy makers, is
   a major challenge for the continued provision of ES in grazing systems.
   In Europe, where such recognition is already often included in
   legislation, the long-term sustainability of related policies and
   incentives to provide such services is viewed as a major issue by the
   respondents.}},

Abstract = {{Mountain lakes are integrated sentinels of changes in the terrestrial
   environment, where these changes threaten the quality of the ecosystem
   services these lakes provide, including high biodiversity, economic and
   leisure activities. Few evidentiary records exist of the long-term
   relationships between human pressure and observed impacts. Multiproxy
   analyses of the Lake Bend sediment sequence, including dating,
   grain-size, geochemistry, pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and chironomid
   assemblage reconstructions, allowed reconstruction of past environmental
   evolution and lake trophic changes. Combined with soil analyses of the
   catchment, these data provide a record of the relationships between
   human activities and the lake-catchment ecosystem, and show the effect
   of inundation of the shore previously used as pasture. From 2100 to 1100
   yrs cal. BP, the catchment was forested. During the Middle Ages, grazing
   deforested the catchment, triggering an increase in erosion and a change
   in sediment sources. The lake remained oligotrophic over most of the
   last millennia. The trophic state changed abruptly in the 20th century
   with intensification and multiplication of tourist activities in the
   catchment, i.e., fishing, hiking, while pastoral activities decreased.
   The sudden eutrophication coincides with an artificial increase of the
   lake water level in AD 1964 to improve fishing activities. A release of
   phosphorus (P) from the flooded soils was observed, which may be
   responsible for the current eutrophication. One thousand years of
   grazing practices would have led to the observed P concentrations in the
   soils of the lake shore, transferred by the cattle to this area. Our
   study highlights the combined effects of past and recent activities on
   the current eutrophication process, and the legacy of both soils and
   early anthropogenic activities. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   communities in a northern Canadian prairie}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{25-36}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Afforestation resulting from fire suppression, modified grazing,
   plantation establishment and climate change poses a threat to northern
   prairie ecosystems. Trees alter the composition and function of plant
   and soil fauna communities and can compromise the restoration of
   afforested prairies. To evaluate the hypothesis that legacies of
   afforestation persist in restored prairie communities and decrease the
   potential for restoration, we examined the composition, structure, and
   diversity of plant and seed bank communities along a 20 year
   chronosequence of plantation tree removal from a northern fescue prairie
   in Riding Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada. Tree removal
   increased the abundance of weedy species in the plant and seed bank
   communities of restored prairies and plant diversity peaked and declined
   over the 20 year period of passive restoration. As a result, time since
   tree removal and the encroachment of invasive species were key in
   explaining the composition of restored prairie communities. Low
   correlation between the species composition of plant and seed bank
   communities, including the complete absence of Festuca hallii in
   restored treatments, demonstrated that legacies of afforestation
   compromised the potential of seed banks to facilitate prairie
   restoration. We conclude that tree removal alone is insufficient for the
   restoration of northern fescue prairies and that, in the absence of
   active management, the persistence of low-diversity plant and seed bank
   communities constitutes an important legacy of afforestation and an
   important barrier to future restoration. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft fur

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{228}},
Pages = {{167-174}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Generalist herbivores are less susceptible to changes in the plant
   composition of their habitats than specialists are because generalists
   can consume a diverse array of plants. However, even generalists exhibit
   dietary choices, for example because they need to balance their
   nutritional intake for both growth and reproduction. In this study, we
   showed that an endangered generalist herbivorous grasshopper (Celes
   akitanus; Orthoptera: Acrididae) actively chooses which plants to
   include in its diet. Moreover, we found that grasshopper abundance is
   correlated with host plant abundance and richness. This grasshopper has
   been reported to occur mainly in traditionally managed grasslands that
   harbour more diverse plant species than other, nearby grasslands. To
   elucidate the links between this grasshopper and plant richness, we
   surveyed grasshopper abundance in grasslands under traditional and other
   management practices. Plant DNA barcoding of faecal samples demonstrated
   that this grasshopper is a generalist herbivore while also showing that
   it makes active dietary choices. Furthermore, although the grasshopper's
   host plants occurred in all grasslands, the grasshopper itself was found
   only in species-rich grasslands. In addition, grasshopper abundance was
   positively related to the abundance and richness of host plants. Our
   findings suggest that this endangered herbivore requires a wide array of
   host plants to maintain its populations.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide reforestation has been recommended as a landscape restoration
   strategy to mitigate climate change in areas where the climate can
   sustain forest. This approach may threaten grassland ecosystems of
   unique biodiversity as such policies are based on the false assumption
   that most grasslands are man-made. Here, we use multiple lines of
   evidence (palaeoecological, pedological, phylogenetic, palaeontological)
   from Central Eastern Europe and show that various types of grasslands
   have persisted in this area throughout the postglacial i.e., the past
   11,700 years. A warm and dry climate, frequent fires, herbivore pressure
   and early Neolithic settlements kept forests open until widespread
   forest clearance beginning 4000 to 3000 years ago. Closed forest cover
   has been the exception for the last two million years. This long-term
   persistence has likely contributed to the high biodiversity of these
   grasslands. Consequently, we call for a more cautious prioritisation of
   the protection of what may be erroneously considered natural, i.e.
   forests, by many environmental specialists and managers. Instead we
   provide a new framework for a better understanding of the evolution and
   persistence of different grassland types and their biodiversity, so that
   grasslands can be better understood, valued and conserved.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological intensification may reduce environmental externalities of
   agriculture by harnessing biodiversity to benefit regulating ecosystem
   services. However, to propose management options for the production of
   such services, there is a need to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics
   of net effects between ecosystem services and disservices provided by
   wild organisms across taxonomic groups in relation to habitat and
   landscape management. We studied the contribution of predatory
   vertebrates and invertebrates (including both carnivores and seed
   herbivores) to regulating ecosystem services and disservices in 16
   cereal fields in response to a local habitat contrast and a landscape
   complexity gradient. From May to November 2016, we provided weed
   (predation reflects an ecosystem service) and crop (predation reflects a
   disservice) seeds, as well as pest (predation reflects an ecosystem
   service) and beneficial (predation reflects a disservice) invertebrate
   prey to predators. Seed predation was dominated by vertebrates, while
   vertebrates and invertebrates contributed equally to predation of animal
   prey. Before harvest, predation steadily increased from very low levels
   in May to high levels in July independent of the resource type. After
   harvest, ecosystem services declined more rapidly than disservices. The
   presence of adjacent seminatural grasslands promoted crop seed
   predation, but reduced pest prey predation. Predation on beneficial prey
   decreased with increasing proportions of seminatural grassland in the
   landscape. Predatory vertebrates and invertebrates provide important
   ecosystem services due to the consumption of pests. However, beneficial
   invertebrates and crop seeds were often consumed to a similar or even
   higher extent than harmful invertebrates or weed seeds. Our results
   therefore raise concerns that management options aimed at enhancing
   service providers may simultaneously increase levels of disservices. By
   considering positive and negative effects simultaneously, this study
   addresses an important knowledge gap and highlights the importance of
   interactions between local management, landscape composition, and
   service and disservice provision across taxa and over time. Considering
   trade-offs between ecosystem services and disservices when evaluating
   the net effects of biodiversity conservation measures on ecosystem
   service provision is crucial. Future agri-environment schemes that offer
   payments for seminatural habitats may need to provide higher
   compensation for farmers in cases where net effects are likely to be
   negative.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing has been shown to alter the structure and functions of
   grassland ecosystems. It is well acknowledged that grazing pressure is
   one of the strongest drivers of ecosystem-level effects of grazing, but
   few studies have assessed how grazing pressure impacts grassland
   biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF). Here, we assessed
   how different metrics of biodiversity (i.e., plants and soil microbes)
   and EMF responded to seven different grazing treatments based on an
   11-year field experiment in semi-arid Inner Mongolian steppe. We found
   that soil organic carbon, plant-available nitrogen and plant functional
   diversity all decreased even at low grazing pressure, while above-ground
   primary production and bacterial abundance decreased only at high levels
   of grazing pressure. Structural equation models revealed that EMF was
   driven by direct effects of grazing, rather than the effects of grazing
   on plant or microbial community composition. Grazing effects on plant
   functional diversity and soil microbial abundance did have moderate
   effects on EMF, while plant richness did not. Synthesis. Our results
   showed ecosystem functions differ in their sensitivity to grazing
   pressure, requiring a low grazing threshold to achieve multiple goals in
   the Eurasian steppe. A is available for this article.}},

Abstract = {{Transhumance is an extensive farming system developed by livestock

   this study was to examine the transhumant sheep and goat system in
   Greece highlighting differences in management aspects among the
   country's regions. Non-parametric statistical methods in a sample of 551
   herders were applied to depict management practices while the regions
   were separated into four groups according to climate and geographical
   features. Results revealed differences between the groups, adoption of
   crossbreeding and limitation of grazing in pastures mainly by sheep
   breeders. The breeding of goats and on average larger herds were met
   mainly in southern Greece while sheep and mixed type of herds, as well
   as smaller on average herds were more common in the northern regions of
   the country. Evidently, transhumance in Greece nowadays preserves its
   traditional character being accustomed to the demand of the market for
   larger production however the introduction of the cross or improved
   dairy breeders should be controlled in order to protect diversity of

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{180}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing evidence of the benefits of introducing urban
   meadows as an alternative to amenity mown grass in public greenspaces,
   both for biodiversity, and human wellbeing. Developing a better
   understanding of the meadow characteristics driving human and wildlife
   response is therefore critical. We addressed this by assessing public
   and invertebrate response to eight different annual meadow mixes defined
   by two levels of plant species diversity and two levels of colour
   diversity, sown in an urban park in Luton, UK, in April 2015. On-site
   questionnaires with the visiting public were conducted in July, August
   and September 2015. Invertebrate responses were assessed via
   contemporaneous visual surveys and one sweep net survey (August 2015).
   Flower colour diversity had effects on human aesthetic response and the
   response of pollinators such as bumblebees and hoverflies. Plant species
   diversity, however, was not a driver of human response with evidence
   that people used colour diversity as a cue to assessing species
   diversity. Plant species diversity did affect some invertebrates, with
   higher abundances of certain taxa in low species diversity meadows. Our
   findings indicate that if the priority for sown meadows is to maximise
   human aesthetic enjoyment and the abundance and diversity of observable
   invertebrates, particularly pollinators, managers of urban green
   infrastructure should prioritise high flower colour diversity mixes over
   those of high plant species diversity. Incorporating late-flowering
   non-native species such as Coreopsis tinctoria (plains coreopsis) can
   prolong the attractiveness of the meadows for people and availability of
   resources for pollinators and would therefore be beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{In regions where intensive farming is the dominant land use, urban areas
   are an opportunity for biodiversity conservation. Thence there is an
   urgent need to promote more biodiversity-friendly cities. Lawns are
   widely distributed urban habitats which cover important surface in
   public and private places. However theses habitats are currently poor
   refuges for plant and animal communities due to their intensive
   management. This study assesses if a reduction in mowing frequency
   results in a more diverse plant community and changes functional
   ecological characteristics of urban lawns. We used a quasi-experimental
   situation resulting from 25 years differentiated management in public
   green spaces of Rennes (France) to evaluate the effect of reduced mowing
   frequency on plant taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity. Our
   results clearly demonstrate that a reduction of mowing frequency induces
   a dramatic increase in the different components of plant community
   diversity that results in a switch from urban lawns to urban meadows.}},

Abstract = {{ContextPlant invasions of native ecosystems are one of the main causes
   of declines in biodiversity via system-simplification. Restoring native
   biodiversity can be particularly challenging in landscapes where
   invasive species have become dominant and where a new set of feedbacks
   reinforce an invaded state and preclude restoration actions. We lack an
   understanding of the response of invaded systems to landscape-level
   manipulations to restore pattern and process relationships and how to
   identify these relationships when they do not appear at the expected
   scale.ObjectivesTo better understand how fire and grazing influence
   landscape-level heterogeneity in invaded landscapes, we assess the scale
   at which grazing pressure and seasonality mediate the success of
   re-introducing a historical disturbance regime, grazing driven by fire
   (termed pyric herbivory), to an invasive plant-dominated
   landscape.MethodsWe manipulated grazing timing and intensity in exotic
   grass-dominated grasslands managed for landscape heterogeneity with
   spring fire and grazing. In pastures under patch-burn grazing
   management, we evaluated the spatial and temporal variability of plant
   functional groups and vegetation structure among and within patches
   managed with separate grazing systems: season-long stocking and
   intensive early stocking.ResultsWarm- and cool-season grasses exhibited
   greater among-patch variability in invasive-plant dominated grassland
   under intensive early grazing than traditional season-long grazing, but
   landscape-level heterogeneity, as measured through vegetation structure
   was minimal and invariable under both levels of grazing pressure, which
   contrasts findings in native-dominated systems. Moreover, within-patch
   heterogeneity for these functional groups was detected; contrasting the
   prediction that among-patch heterogeneity, in mesic grasslands,
   manifests from within-patch homogeneity.ConclusionsIn invaded
   grasslands, manipulation of grazing pressure as a process that drives
   heterogeneous vegetation patterns influences native and non-native grass
   heterogeneity, but not heterogeneity of vegetation structure, within and
   among patches managed with fire. Fire and grazing-moderated
   heterogeneity patterns observed in native grass-dominated grasslands
   likely differ from invasive grass-dominated grasslands with implications
   for using pyric herbivory in invaded systems.}},

Abstract = {{ContextHabitat loss is a major threat to biodiversity. It can create
   temporal lags in decline of species in relation to destruction of
   habitat coverage. Plant species specialized in semi-natural grasslands,
   especially meadows, often express such extinction debt.ObjectivesWe
   studied habitat loss and fragmentation of meadows and examined whether
   the changes in meadow coverage had caused an extinction debt on vascular
   plants. We also studied whether historical or present landscape patterns
   or contemporary environmental factors were more important determinants
   of species occurrence.MethodsWe surveyed the plant species assemblages
   of 12 grazed and 12 mown meadows in Central Finland and detected the
   meadow coverages from their surroundings on two spatial scales and on
   three time steps. We modelled the effects of functional connectivity,
   habitat amount, and isolation on species richness and community
   composition.ResultsWe observed drastic and dynamic meadow loss in
   landscapes surrounding our study sites during the last 150years.
   However, we did not find explicit evidence for an extinction debt in
   meadow plants. The observed species richness correlated with
   contemporary factors, whereas both contemporary factors and habitat
   availability during the 1960s affected community
   composition.ConclusionsEffective conservation management of meadow
   biodiversity builds on accurate understanding of the relative importance
   of past and present factors on species assemblages. Both mown and grazed
   meadows with high species richness need to be managed in the future. The
   management effort should preferably be targeted to sites located near to
   each other.}},

Abstract = {{ContextLoss and fragmentation of semi-natural grasslands has critically
   affected many butterfly species in Europe. Habitat area and isolation
   can have strong effects on the local biodiversity but species may also
   be strongly affected by the surrounding matrix.ObjectivesWe explored how
   different land cover types in the landscape explained the occurrence of
   butterfly species in semi-natural grasslands.MethodsUsing data from 476
   semi-natural grasslands in Sweden, we analysed the effect of matrix
   composition on species richness and occurrence. Additionally, we
   analysed at which spatial scales butterflies responded to matrix types
   (forests, semi-natural grasslands, arable land and water).ResultsForest
   cover showed the strongest positive effect on species richness, followed
   by semi-natural grasslands. Forest also had a positive effect on
   red-listed species at local scales. Responses to matrix composition were
   highly species-specific. The majority of the 30most common species
   showed strong positive responses to the amount of forest cover within
   200-500m. There was a smaller group of species showing a positive
   response to arable land cover within 500-2000m. Thirteen species showed
   positive responses to the amount of semi-natural grasslands, generally
   at larger scales (10-30km).ConclusionsOur study showed that surrounding
   forest is beneficial for many grassland butterfly species and that
   forests might mitigate the negative effects of habitat loss caused by
   agricultural intensification. Also, semi-natural grasslands were an
   important factor for species richness at larger spatial scales,
   indicating that a landscape consisting mainly of supporting habitats
   (i.e. forests) are insufficient to sustain a rich butterfly fauna.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivores alter plant biodiversity (species richness) in many of the
   world's ecosystems, but the magnitude and the direction of herbivore
   effects on biodiversity vary widely within and among ecosystems. One
   current theory predicts that herbivores enhance plant biodiversity at
   high productivity but have the opposite effect at low productivity. Yet,
   empirical support for the importance of site productivity as a mediator
   of these herbivore impacts is equivocal. Here, we synthesize data from
   252 large-herbivore exclusion studies, spanning a 20-fold range in site
   productivity, to test an alternative hypothesis-that herbivore-induced
   changes in the competitive environment determine the response of plant
   biodiversity to herbivory irrespective of productivity. Under this
   hypothesis, when herbivores reduce the abundance (biomass, cover) of
   dominant species (for example, because the dominant plant is palatable),
   additional resources become available to support new species, thereby
   increasing biodiversity. By contrast, if herbivores promote high
   dominance by increasing the abundance of herbivory-resistant,
   unpalatable species, then resource availability for other species
   decreases reducing biodiversity. We show that herbivore-induced change
   in dominance, independent of site productivity or precipitation (a proxy
   for productivity), is the best predictor of herbivore effects on
   biodiversity in grassland and savannah sites. Given that most herbaceous
   ecosystems are dominated by one or a few species, altering the
   competitive environment via herbivores or by other means may be an
   effective strategy for conserving biodiversity in grasslands and
   savannahs globally.}},

Pages = {{147-156}},

Abstract = {{Background and aims Soil inoculation is a powerful tool for the
   restoration of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the origin of the donor
   material may differentially influence early- and late-successional plant
   species. Donor soil from late-succession stages may benefit target plant
   species due to a higher abundance of soil-borne mutualists. Arable
   soils, on the other hand, may suppress ruderals as they support more
   root herbivores that preferentially attack ruderal plant species, while
   mid-succession soils may be intermediate in their effects on ruderals
   and target species performance. We hypothesized that a mixture of arable
   and late-succession inocula may outperform pure late-successional
   inocula for restoration, by promoting late-successional target plants,
   while simultaneously reducing ruderal species' performance.
   Methods We conducted a glasshouse experiment and tested the growth of
   ruderal and target plant species on pure and mixed inocula. The inocula
   were derived from arable fields, mid-succession grasslands and
   late-succession heathlands and we created a replacement series testing
   different pairwise mixitures for each of these inocula types (ratios:
   100:0, 75:25, 50:50, 25:75, 0:100 of inoculum A and B respectively).
   Results In general, we found that a higher proportion of heathland
   material led to a higher aboveground biomass of target plant species,
   while responses of ruderal species were variable. We found synergistic
   effects when specific inocula were mixed. In particular, a 50:50 mixture
   of heathland and arable soil in the inoculum led to a significant
   reduction in ruderal species biomass relative to the two respective pure
   inocula. The overall response was driven by Myosotis arvensis, since the
   other two ruderal species were not significantly affected.
   Conclusions Mixing inocula from different successional stages can lead
   to synergistic effects on restoration, but this highly depends on the
   specific combination of inocula, the mixing ratio and plant species.
   This suggest that specific inocula may need to be developed in order to
   rapidly restore different plant communities.}},

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Urbanisation is a growing global phenomenon having multiple ecological
   consequences. However, the effects of urbanisation on biodiversity
   remain ambiguous, and some evidence exists that cities provide valuable
   secondary habitats for many species, possibly mitigating regional
   biodiversity loss. Therefore, the value of urban sites for biodiversity
   depends on local habitat conditions and the configuration of the
   surrounding landscape. We aimed to disentangle the effects of local
   habitatparameters (management, plant diversity) and urban matrix
   variables (urbanisation, isolation) on carabid beetle and spider
   diversity and traits in informal urban green spaces in Berlin, Germany.
   Habitat management and isolation were the most important influences on
   carabid beetle and spider species and trait compositions. Spider
   communities of irregular managed sites contained 2.5 times more species
   of conservation concern than extensive (regular) managed sites.
   Moreover, irregular managed sites contained larger species (both for
   carabid beetles and spiders) and affected the hunting mode of spiders.
   Isolated sites tended to have lower spider species richness and number
   of spider species of conservation concern. Moreover, isolated sites were
   characterised by small, mobile and herbivorous carabid beetles. In
   contrast, urbanisation and local plant diversity had no effect on
   carabid beetles and spiders. We conclude that urban grasslands within
   residential areas - even if not targeted for conservation plans - can
   provide important habitats for conserving biodiversity, including
   species of conservation concern. Reducing the intensity of habitat
   management and increasing the connectivity of urban grassland sites can
   promote diverse arthropod communities and should therefore be considered
   in urban planning.}},

Abstract = {{Land abandonment is an important driver of biodiversity changes. Nearly
   60 million ha of cropland and huge areas of managed grassland were
   abandoned after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. We compared
   community structure and abundances of farmland birds on used and
   abandoned cropland, pastures and hay meadows in a study area situated in
   the Western Siberian crop belt. Abandoned land hosted distinct
   communities of farmland birds that were similar to those of abandoned
   farmland elsewhere in the former Soviet Union. More species profited
   from abandonment than suffered, but the densities of a distinct group of
   `meadow birds', a group of high conservation concern in Eurasia, were
   lower on abandoned land compared to managed pastures and hay meadows.
   Abandoned land had taller, but not denser vegetation and higher plant
   litter cover than used pastures and hay meadows. The vegetation
   structure of abandoned land explained differences in bird abundance
   well, and responses to vegetation parameters were non-linear and
   species-specific. Future land-use trends are difficult to predict, but
   cropland recultivation and intensification seem likely. Conservation
   strategies should entail minimized reclamation of abandoned cropland
   (perhaps coupled with sustainable intensification on existing farmland),
   and low-input management of pastures and hay meadows. As a large
   proportion of the grassland is managed for subsistence farming, measures
   to slow down further rural human outmigration would also benefit bird
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{1. It is broadly accepted that plant diversity influences
   plant-herbivore interactions, yet few studies have separated damage by
   different herbivore species and simultaneously tested for effects on
   herbivory and plant defences to elucidate the mechanisms underlying such
   effects. 2. This study tested for effects of tree species diversity on
   leaf damage by beetle larvae and caterpillars on Cordia dodecandra in a
   diversity experiment, and measured leaf chemical and physical traits to
   assess whether differences in herbivory underlie changes in plant
   traits. 3. Four year-old trees were sampled in 21 x 21-m plots
   classified as monocultures of C. dodecandra or mixtures of this species
   plus three other tree species. Herbivory by beetle larvae and
   caterpillars was estimated, and we subsequently collected undamaged
   leaves to quantify total phenolics and condensed tannins, trichome
   density, and specific leaf area. 4. A significant effect of diversity on
   herbivory by beetle larvae was found, with mixtures exhibiting an 80\%
   lower mean value than monocultures. By contrast, there was no diversity
   effect on caterpillar herbivory. Additionally, a positive relationship
   was found between beetle larvae (but not caterpillar) damage and plant
   chemical defences, yet there was no effect of diversity on defences.
   Specific leaf area was higher and trichome density tended to be lower in
   mixtures than in monocultures, but neither trait was associated with
   herbivory, and damage did not explain diversity effects on these traits.
   5. These findings emphasise the importance of separating diversity
   effects on different herbivore species and measuring plant traits
   associated with herbivory to better understand controls of diversity on
   plant-herbivore interactions.}},

Abstract = {{The Himalayas are a global biodiversity hotspot threatened by widespread
   agriculture and pasture expansion. To determine the impact of these
   threats on biodiversity and to formulate appropriate conservation
   strategies, we surveyed birds along elevational gradients in primary
   forest and in human-dominated lands spanning a gradient of habitat
   alteration, including forest-agriculture mosaics, mixed agriculture
   mosaics, and pasture. We surveyed birds during the breeding season and
   in winter to account for pronounced seasonal migrations. Bird abundance
   and richness in forest-agriculture and mixed agriculture mosaics were
   equal to or greater than in primary forest and greater than in pasture
   at local and landscape scales during both seasons. Pasture had greater
   abundance and richness of birds in winter than primary forest, but
   richness was greater in primary forest at the landscape scale during the
   breeding season. All 4 land-use types held unique species, suggesting
   that all must be retained in the landscape to conserve the entire
   avifauna. Our results suggest forest-agriculture and mixed agriculture
   mosaics are particularly important for sustaining Himalayan bird
   communities during winter and primary forests are vital for sustaining
   Himalayan bird communities during the breeding season. Further
   conversion of forest-agriculture and mixed agriculture mosaics to
   pasture would likely result in significant biodiversity losses that
   would disproportionately affect breeding species. To ensure
   comprehensive conservation, strategies in the western Himalayas must
   balance the protection of intact primary forest with the minimization of
   pasture expansion.}},

Title = {{Six years of grazing exclusion is the optimum duration in the alpine
   meadow-steppe of the north-eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau}},

Abstract = {{Grazing exclusion is an effective management strategy for restoring
   degraded grasslands worldwide, but the effects of different exclusion
   durations on vegetation structure and soil properties remain unclear.
   Therefore, we evaluated vegetation characteristics and soil properties
   in an alpine meadowsteppe under grazing exclusion of different lengths
   (with grazing and with 3-year, 6-year, 9-year and 11-year grazing
   exclusions) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). We also explored the
   relationships among above-ground biomass, biodiversity and soil
   properties to ascertain the mechanism underlying the impact of grazing
   exclusion on these factors. The results showed that the above-and
   below-ground biomass, total number of plant species, community density,
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index, evenness index, richness index, soil and
   vegetation carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) storage and ecosystem C and N
   storage exhibited a hump-shaped pattern in response to the length of
   grazing exclusion with a 6-year threshold. In addition, structural
   equation modelling showed that the bulk density, soil moisture content,
   micro sand content and clay and silt contents were the most important
   determining factors leading to an increase in above-ground biomass in
   the alpine meadow-steppe after grazing exclusion, whereas the soil total
   N, available N, available phosphate and soil organic C content were the
   most important determining factors leading to a decrease in
   biodiversity. Considering the stability of the plant community and the C
   and N pools, long-term grazing exclusion (> 9 years) is unnecessary, and
   the optimum exclosure duration of the moderately degraded Elymus
   nutans-Kobresia humilis type alpine meadow-steppe is six years on the
   north-eastern QTP.}},

Title = {{Interaction of land management and araucaria trees in the maintenance of
   landscape diversity in the highlands of southern Brazil}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{In the southern Brazilian highlands, pre-Columbian societies created
   domesticated landscapes through the use and management of forests,
   including nurse Araucaria angustifolia trees, a common conifer in these
   regions. Nowadays, local smallholders still use traditional practices,
   such as burning, to promote vegetation for cattle grazing in highland
   grasslands. Even though burning is normally of small extent and low
   frequency, such management can slow down natural forest expansion and
   contribute to the maintenance of grasslands, by opposing the
   facilitative effect of nurse araucaria trees. To comprehend the
   interplay between human cultural management, species interactions and
   the environment, it is important to better understand how these
   relations affect diversity and composition. Our goal was to investigate
   how land management, biotic interactions and abiotic factors affect
   saplings species richness, abundance and composition. We hypothesized
   that (1) land management would decrease sapling richness and abundance
   and change sapling composition, (2) nurse araucaria trees would increase
   species richness and abundance and change sapling composition, and (3)
   the interactive effect between land management and nurse araucaria trees
   would shape sapling richness, abundance and composition. Data were
   collected in unmanaged and managed conditions, both beneath araucaria
   crowns and in nearby treeless areas. Our results indicate that abundance
   and species composition are affected by land management and araucaria
   crown influence. The highest values of sapling abundance were found
   beneath crowns in unmanaged areas. Species composition changed between
   all assessed combinations of land management and crown influence. Our
   study demonstrates the major roles of land management and facilitation
   in structuring communities, despite the effects of rock and grass cover.
   Moreover, our results clarify patterns and processes that may emerge in
   natural highland grasslands, such as the conversion of grasslands into
   forests and the loss of cultural landscapes when the main local
   management actions are excluded.}},

Abstract = {{The `Chaine des Puys/Limagne fault' is a unique landscape located in the
   French Massif Central, and famous for its original and perfect
   landforms. For more than 400 years, it has been subjected to various
   local, national, and European policies intended to protect its `natural'
   and open aspect. Though these landscapes look natural, they are the
   result of interactions between local forest- and grassland-management
   practices, natural vegetation dynamics, and regulation by environmental
   policies. Some parts of the area have seen their biodiversity and
   landscape quality increase, but others have been abandoned or forested,
   resulting in closed landscapes and reduced biodiversity. Based on a
   review and a systemic analysis of the policies, this article aims to
   analyse the reasons for their lack of effectiveness, and propose some
   principles that can help future policies to be more effective in
   protecting mountain grazing landscapes with the support of local

Title = {{Fir expansion not controlled by moderate densities of large herbivores:
   a Mediterranean mountain grassland conservation issue}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{center dot Key message Whilst livestock has maintained grasslands over
   centuries in south European mountains, current ungulate densities are
   insufficient to control tree and forest expansion effectively. The
   present results based on fir population dynamics and radial/height
   growth raise questions about the sustainable management of new forests
   that are former mountain grasslands. This empirical case study
   contributes to debate about methods for long-term management of
   grasslands in Mediterranean mountains.
   center dot Context Forest expansion following the cessation of grazing
   is a threat to biodiversity in mountain grasslands that are components
   of Mediterranean cultural landscapes.
   center dot Aims We hypothesised that ungulates could mitigate tree
   recruitment, thus conserving mountain grasslands. We tested the
   efficiency of grazing and browsing by domestic and wild ungulates
   (sheep, roe and red deer) at inhibiting silver fir (Abies alba Mill.)
   encroachment in a conservation area, one of the main browsed trees.
   center dot Methods The fir trees' age structure was analysed by
   dendrochronology, and the individual growth patterns and scars were
   recorded in their tree-ring series.
   center dot Results Fir density has increased since the 1960s,
   simultaneously with the increase in ungulate populations. The scar
   occurrences only appeared during the 1970s. Most scars were observed on
   seedlings and small saplings. The impacts of ungulates are observed on
   the radial and height growth of trees, mostly on trees < 100 cm, but it
   did not however result in controlling the recruitment of fir.
   center dot Conclusion The hypothesis that a moderate density of
   ungulates might inhibit tree encroachment is therefore rejected, even in
   the case of a highly palatable species such as silver fir. Ungulates,
   solely, would not be an appropriate policy for grassland conservation in
   Mediterranean mountains.}},

Title = {{Grass management intensity affects butterfly and orthopteran diversity
   on rice field banks}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{267}},
Pages = {{147-155}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification through landscape homogenization has been
   identified as one of the main drivers of the recent biodiversity decline
   in European farmlands. In particular, the loss of non-cropped habitats
   has often deprived farmland species of feeding and nesting sites, refuge
   areas, and dispersal corridors. In this framework, well-managed field
   margins may play a key role for wildlife conservation in agroecosystems,
   providing additional suitable habitat patches for many species, which
   also include several natural agents of pests' biological control. In
   rice crops, paddy banks are usually heavily managed by farmers, which
   remove vegetation through chemical or mechanical procedures, with a
   consequent limitation of the potential role of levees in maintaining a
   functional agroecosystem. The aim of this study was to investigate the
   response of butterfly and orthopteran diversity to different grass
   management practices on rice field banks, namely herbicide spraying,
   mowing, and no management. Between April and September 2016, we sampled
   butterflies and orthopterans on 30 and 22 paddy levees respectively,
   located in three sites within the intensive rice crop district of
   northern Italy. Herbicides spraying proved to be the most detrimental
   practice for these insects, producing a considerable reduction in
   species richness and abundance in comparison with unmanaged and mown
   banks. The impacts of mowing were less pronounced than those of chemical
   treatments; however, frequent cutting caused a significant reduction in
   butterfly and orthopteran diversity on levees. Our results highlight the
   importance of unmanaged banks in preserving insect diversity in rice
   crops, while herbicide spraying should be avoided. Low frequency and
   rotational mowing could represent sustainable management solutions to
   meet biodiversity and husbandry requirements in this agroecosystem.}},

Title = {{Assessing the impact of grassland management extensification in
   temperate areas on multiple ecosystem services and biodiversity}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{267}},
Pages = {{201-212}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{In order to halt further biodiversity loss in the agricultural
   landscape, measures for grassland management extensification have been
   proposed and implemented. Apart from biodiversity conservation and
   enhancement, these measures are expected to affect a range of ecosystem
   services delivered by these grasslands. It is well-known that grasslands
   have the potential to contribute to the delivery of multiple ecosystem
   services, but there generally is a trade-off between provisioning
   services and regulating services, which is strongly linked to grassland
   management. This study investigated the effect of the extensification of
   grassland management on multiple ecosystem service and biodiversity
   indicators. To do so, two sets of grasslands in Flanders with varying
   management types were monitored: a regular, intensive management, a
   meadow bird management and a botanical management. For every monitored
   grassland, a land use intensity index was calculated and linked to the
   ecosystem service and biodiversity indicators. The results showed that
   biomass yield, forage quality, soil mineral N content and number of
   plant species differed among the various management types and that
   increasing land use intensity resulted in higher biomass yields, forage
   quality and soil mineral N content and in a lower number of plant
   species. However, it was observed that other factors such as the timing
   of the first cut affected these variables as well. A literature review
   was subsequently performed to quantify the link between land use
   intensity of other temperate grasslands and the same response variables.
   Results of the literature review confirmed the trends that were found in
   the monitoring data, but an additional effect of manure and slurry
   application on soil carbon stock was noted. Taken together, the results
   suggest that the impact of grassland management in terms of
   fertilization, mowing and grazing on the selected ecosystem service
   delivery and biodiversity indicators can be predicted, but that other
   management components should be considered as well.}},

Abstract = {{Hay meadows are an important component of the alpine landscape, which
   evolved over millennia of human activities. When traditionally managed,
   hay meadows support a rich flora and are recognized for high species
   diversity. However, both intensification and abandonment can lead to a
   loss of biodiversity in this vegetation. In this paper, the focus was on
   the hay meadows where Narcissus radiiflorus Salisb. forms white mosaic
   carpets during the blooming period. This vegetation was studied through
   26 phytosociological releves, taken in the Venetian Pre-Alps and outer
   Dolomites (Northern Italy). Releves were numerically classified and
   analysed in their relationships with site conditions. Moreover,
   diversity metrics were calculated for detecting the conservation status
   of hay meadows subjected to different types of disturbance. The results
   showed that poet's daffodils' dominance brings together hay meadows
   showing a substantial range of floristic and ecologic variation and that
   part of the stands dominated by Narcissus radiiflorus could be referred
   to a habitat type regarded as prioritary for nature conservation.
   Moreover, management-related variations in functional diversity
   suggested that the best practice recommended for conservation and
   restoration of this habitat is the continuation of traditional late
   mowing. This practice will allow preserving both biodiversity and
   ecosystem functions and services.}},

Abstract = {{Questions How do interactions between global change factors (climate and
   land use, including livestock management) shape plant species richness
   patterns in mountain grassland communities? Does topography interact
   with global change factors to modulate their effect on within-community
   plant diversity? Location Pyrenees, Spain. Methods We used an initial
   set of 20 predictors: climatic, biogeographic, livestock management and
   topographic. Our data set included a wide range of management and
   climatic conditions from mediterranean to alpine environments. After a
   variable selection procedure with random forest, we built GLM to explain
   species richness in plant communities through 100-m(2) plots (SR100),
   employing backward-forward selection with AIC and other techniques.
   Results The main filters of SR100 were the regional factors (climate and
   biogeography, with 23\% and 17\%, respectively, of the total
   contribution to SR100), followed by livestock management (14\%) and
   topography (9\%). Interactions between climatic and biogeographic
   variables were almost as important as the main effects (18\%).
   Fragmentation effects were higher under low mean minimum temperatures
   and summer precipitation compared with other conditions. Connectivity
   interacted with most of the climatic variables. Moderately high stocking
   rates mitigated plant community species losses triggered by decreased
   connectivity. Sheep-grazed grassland communities had lower SR100 than
   differently managed grasslands under low fragmentation scenarios;
   conversely, sheep grazing enhanced SR100 when fragmentation was high.
   Topographic predictors accounted for lower variability in SR100 than
   regional and management factors and were independent from these.
   Conclusions Several multi-scale spatial filters determine SR100 of
   grassland communities in the Pyrenees, interacting through complex
   processes. Climate can enhance negative effects of fragmentation and
   lack of connectivity on SR100 under stressful conditions. Livestock
   management modified the impact of patch disaggregation and fragmentation
   on SR100.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of botanical diversity on supply of polyunsaturated fatty
   acids (PUFA) to ruminants in vitro, and the fatty acid (FA) composition
   of muscle in lambs was investigated. Six plant species, commonly grown
   as part of UK herbal ley mixtures (Trifolium pratense, Lotus
   corniculatus, Achillea millefolium, Centaurea nigra, Plantago lanceolata
   and Prunella vulgaris), were assessed for FA profile, and in vitro
   biohydrogenation of constituent PUFA, to estimate intestinal supply of
   PUFA available for absorption by ruminants. Modelling the in vitro data
   suggested that L. corniculatus and P. vulgaris had the greatest
   potential to increase 18:3n-3 supply to ruminants, having the highest
   amounts escaping in vitro biohydrogenation. Biodiverse pastures were
   established using the six selected species, under-sown in a perennial
   ryegrass-based sward. Lambs were grazed (similar to 50 days) on
   biodiverse or control pastures and the effects on the FA composition of
   musculus longissimus thoracis (lean and subcutaneous fat) and musculus
   semimembranosus (lean) were determined. Biodiverse pasture increased
   18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3 contents of m. semimembranosus (+14.8 and +7.2
   mg/100 g tissue, respectively) and the subcutaneous fat of m.
   longissimus thoracis (+158 and +166 mg/100 g tissue, respectively)
   relative to feeding a perennial ryegrass pasture. However, there was no
   effect on total concentrations of saturated FA in the tissues studied.
   It was concluded that enhancing biodiversity had a positive impact on
   muscle FA profile reflected by increased levels of total PUFA.}},

Abstract = {{Flower flies are one of the most important groups of pollinators
   worldwide. Unfortunately, little is known about their pollination
   capacity and the importance of their role for many crops grown
   commercially, such as cranberries. To address this information gap, 12
   cranberry farms were sampled during the blooming periods of 2013 and
   2014 in Quebec, Canada, to evaluate hoverfly diversity and pollen load.
   Moreover, the effects of the following three factors on community
   structure were investigated: farm management (organic vs conventional),
   edge mowing (mowed vs non-mowed), and type of adjacent natural habitat
   (forest vs meadow vs bog). Flower flies were captured using pan-traps
   and hand-netting once a week for 3 wk. In total 461 specimens of flower
   flies were captured and 33 species were identified. Among the three
   factors studied, edge mowing explained most of the variation among
   communities, followed by farm management. Natural habitat type did not
   appear to influence hoverfly communities, contrary to our expectations
   and reports from other studies. Pollen load analyses and interactive
   connectance plot showed that two flower fly species, Syrphus torvus
   Osten Sacken and Eristalis tenax L. (Diptera: Syrphidae), transported
   the most cranberry pollen, both in terms of quantity and proportion.To
   our knowledge, this study is the first to describe and provide a
   complete list of flower fly species found in cranberry crops. Our
   results also highlight the importance of floral resource diversity for
   these potential cranberry pollinators, since edge mowing was revealed to
   be the most influential of all factors we considered.}},

Abstract = {{Human activities have modified wetlands all over the word. Water control
   structures that are frequently implemented in these ecosystems to keep
   lands free of flooding can decrease or degrade habitat for biodiversity.
   The Parana River Delta, one of the largest wetlands in Argentina, has
   recently experienced rapid cattle grazing intensification facilitated by
   water control structures, resulting in extensive conversion of wetlands
   to pastures. It is unclear if this loss of wetlands has had a negative
   impact on the highly diverse bird community. Here, we evaluated the
   changes in bird assemblages in the Lower Delta of Parana River after
   14years of cattle grazing intensification. We compared point count data
   from 1997 to 1999 with data collected in 2012 and 2013 using the same
   survey methods. We assessed the temporal changes in bird richness and
   composition using paired permutation tests and multivariate analysis. We
   related the bird composition to landscape changes to analyse if avian
   changes were associated with landscape dynamics. We found that after
   14years, the bird community differed greatly. In general, species
   richness decreased, especially in wet years. We found fewer wetland
   species in recent surveys; in particular we did not register
   saffron-cowled blackbird (Xanthopsar flavus), a species listed as
   globally vulnerable. Changes in bird composition were associated with an
   increase in bare soil due to land-use changes. Even though inter-annual
   differences in precipitation and river stage have great effects on the
   species present in the surveys, the absence of many wetland species in
   recent wet years, that is when habitat is suitable for them, is most
   likely due to changes in land cover. Globally, agricultural land use
   makes inroads into many wetlands, eroding their quality and extent.
   Maintenance of wetland species requires that conservation efforts focus
   on these vulnerable ecosystems before full-scale land conversion occurs.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{32}},
Pages = {{53-65}},

Abstract = {{Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have a significant influence on plant
   productivity and diversity in non-grazing grassland. However, the
   interactive effects between grazing intensity and AMP on plant community
   composition in natural grassland communities are not well known. We
   conducted a field experiment that manipulated AMF colonization and
   grazing intensity to study the impact of AMF suppression on plant
   community composition and nutrient status over 2 years (2015-2016) with
   contrasting rainfall levels. We found that AMF root colonization was
   significantly reduced by the application of the fungicide benomyl as a
   soil drench. Grazing intensity regulated plant community composition and
   aboveground biomass mainly by reducing the growth of Leymus chinensis
   over 2 years. AMF suppression increased the growth of Chenopodium
   glaucum, but it did not alter other plant species across all grazing
   intensities. The effects of AMF suppression on plant community
   composition changed along a grazing gradient considerably between years:
   AMF suppression increased the biomass of C. glaucum across all grazing
   intensities in 2015, but slightly increased it in 2016. Interactions
   between AMF suppression and grazing intensity altered the phosphorus
   concentration of Stipa grandis and Cleistogenes squarrosa in 2015 but
   not in 2016. AMF suppression decreased the shoot phosphorus content of
   L. chinensis but increased that of C. glaucum across all grazing
   intensities. Our results indicate that grazing intensity substantially
   alters aboveground community biomass and affects growth of dominant
   species; AMF by itself have limited effects on plant communities along a
   grazing gradient in typical steppe. (C) 2018 Gesellschaft far Okologie.

Abstract = {{Farmland birds are among the most threatened bird species in Europe,
   largely as a result of agricultural intensification which has driven
   widespread biodiversity losses. Breeding waders associated with
   grassland and arable habitats are particularly vulnerable and a frequent
   focus of agri-environment schemes (AES) designed to halt and reverse
   population declines. We review existing literature, providing a
   quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of policy and management
   interventions used throughout Europe to improve population and
   demographic metrics of grassland-breeding waders. Targeted AES and site
   protection measures were more likely to be effective than less targeted
   AES and were ten times more likely to be effective than would be
   expected by chance, particularly for population trend and productivity
   metrics. Positive effects of AES and site protection did not appear
   synergistic. Management interventions which had the greatest chance of
   increasing population growth or productivity included modification of
   mowing regimes, increasing wet conditions, and the use of nest
   protection. Success rates varied according to the species and metric
   being evaluated. None of the policy or management interventions we
   evaluated were associated with a significant risk of negative impacts on
   breeding waders. Our findings support the use of agri-environment
   schemes, site protection, and management measures for grassland-breeding
   wader conservation in Europe. Due to publication bias, our findings are
   most applicable to intensively managed agricultural landscapes. More
   studies are needed to identify measures that increase chick survival.
   Despite broadly effective conservation measures already in use,
   grassland-breeding waders in Europe continue to decline. More research
   is needed to improve the likelihood and magnitude of positive outcomes,
   coupled with wider implementation of effective measures to substantially
   increase favorable land management for these species.}},

Abstract = {{Eutrophication is a major cause of biodiversity loss. In grasslands,
   this appears to occur due to asymmetric competition for light following
   the increases in aboveground biomass production. Here, we report the
   results of an experiment with five grass species that tests how
   well-competitive outcomes can be predicted under a factorial combination
   of fertilized and disturbed (frequent cutting) conditions. Under fertile
   conditions, our results confirm earlier success in predicting short-term
   competitive outcomes based on light interception in monocultures. This
   effect was maintained but weakened under less fertile conditions with
   competition becoming more symmetric. However, under disturbed
   conditions, competitive outcomes could not be predicted from differences
   in light interception in monocultures regardless of fertility. Our
   results support the idea that competition in grasslands shifts from
   symmetric to asymmetric as fertility increases but that disturbance
   destroys this relationship, presumably by preventing the development of
   differences in canopy structure and reducing competition for light.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{To mitigate biodiversity loss, it is essential to understand how areas
   altered by human land use can act as alternative habitats for functional
   groups of species, which are in decline. In forested landscapes,
   power-line clearings can be valuable habitats for early successional
   plant species, which in turn provide important food resources for
   pollinating insects. However, we know little about how management
   practices affect plant diversity, or how changes in species diversity
   translate into the functional diversity of floral resources. We
   conducted an experiment at 19 sites in power-line clearings across
   southeast Norway where the woody vegetation was (1) cut and left to
   decay, (2) cut and removed, or (3) uncut. We assessed the effects of
   treatments on species diversity (richness, evenness, diversity) and
   functional diversity (functional evenness, functional dispersion) of
   understory plant communities of insect-pollinated plants. We also
   investigated the influence of environmental conditions within the
   power-line clearings, the surrounding landscape, and climatic factors on
   species and functional diversity. We found that the cut and cut-remove
   treatments were effective in increasing biological diversity of
   insect-pollinated plants. The species and functional diversity showed
   contrasting responses to treatments, and the treatment effects depended
   on the environmental context. This shows that ecosystem functioning is
   not necessarily predictable from the ecological processes that drive
   species composition. The treatment effects on species diversity were
   partly explained by the stress-gradient hypothesis; species richness was
   higher in the cleared plots in areas of low environmental stress from
   precipitation and elevation. In contrast, the treatment effects on
   functional diversity were positively influenced by productivity, stem
   density, temperature, available source habitats, elevation, and canopy
   density. Functional diversity, based on effect traits, should be
   emphasized when the aim is to maintain a broad range of pollination
   functions and services in power-line clearings. This study shows that
   inclusion of power-line clearings in conservation plans can mitigate
   biodiversity decline in forested landscapes. We recommend the cut-remove
   treatment in productive areas with available source habitats and high
   stem density. In low productive areas, with high stem density and high
   temperatures, the standard cut treatment is sufficient, but a higher
   cutting frequency is recommended.}},

Title = {{Epifaunal diversity patterns within and among seagrass meadows suggest
   landscape-scale biodiversity processes}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Coastal seascapes can support high animal diversity and secondary
   productivity that attracts conservation interest and provides ecosystem
   services. Though the importance of spatial structure in marine habitats
   is well known, determining the dominant spatial scale for biodiversity
   patterns is an often-overlooked dimension of the ecological and
   conservation value of seagrass meadows. We estimated biodiversity
   patterns at fine (0.28 m(2)), meadow and seascape scales to explore
   whether seagrass-associated biodiversity patterns are consistent with
   spatial processes such as abiotic habitat filtering or metacommunity
   dynamics in a northeast Pacific seascape. In Barkley Sound, British
   Columbia, we quantified epifaunal biodiversity on eelgrass (Zostera
   marina) to test three hypotheses: Taxonomic diversity and composition
   (1) vary randomly within meadows but (2) vary systematically among
   meadows reflecting meadow location or environmental conditions, and (3)
   spatial patterns are stable over time. We sampled epifaunal
   invertebrates in a systematic spatial grid within nine eelgrass meadows.
   We found that epifaunal community composition varied as much over a few
   meters within the same meadow as among meadows separated by kilometers
   and of different sizes and wave exposures. In each meadow, we observed
   less than three-quarters of the species in the regional species pool,
   and we observed non-random spatial aggregation within many species. Even
   with spatial turnover, assemblages were more similar than predicted by
   null models based on random species distributions, suggesting that some
   species tend to co-occur in high abundance. These spatial biodiversity
   patterns were not clearly explained by meadow location, area, or abiotic
   conditions, except that there were differences in clusters of meadows
   distinguished by their salinity (more marine vs. more fresh). Our
   results indicate that effective conservation and understanding of how
   seagrass can support high biodiversity and ecosystem function may
   require consideration of spatial connections among meadows, and not just
   the condition of the meadows themselves.}},

Abstract = {{The most common mechanism of biological invasions is an increase in
   competition, which usually results in the loss of biodiversity. The
   invasion of Bromus erectus (Syn. Bromopsis erecta) in calcareous
   grasslands of western and central Europe is well-documented. Although,
   it is largely unknown to what extent this development affects
   biodiversity. In this study, we analysed the effects of B. erectus
   invasion on vascular plant and leafhopper assemblages of calcareous
   grasslands. At each of the 15 randomly selected sites, we compared one
   plot with stands of Bromus (presence) and one without (absence) (paired
   sampling design). The invasion of B. erectus affected vegetation
   structure as well as vascular plant and leafhopper assemblages. Despite
   similar abiotic site characteristics, Bromus plots had a higher turf
   height, vegetation density, and litter cover. Additionally, we recorded
   a much lower species richness in Bromus plots than in absence plots in
   all analysed groups of vascular plants. A similar pattern was found for
   leafhoppers. Absence plots exhibited a higher species richness of
   habitat and diet specialists than Bromus plots. The overall abundance of
   all leafhopper species was highest in presence plots, whereas that of
   diet specialists peaked in absence plots. We conclude that the ongoing
   invasion of B. erectus will lead to a strong structural homogenisation
   with negative effects on plant and insect diversity. One possible
   management tool might be a goal-driven rough grazing with sheep -
   especially in spring when B. erectus is much more palatable than in
   summer and autumn.}},

Abstract = {{Latin America, and particularly, the Rio de la Plata Grasslands (RPG),
   are one of the regions with the highest rates of land use change
   worldwide. These changes drastically alter ecosystems energy flows,
   affecting biodiversity, atmospheric composition, and the ecosystem
   capacity to provide services. In this work we evaluated the impact of
   these changes on Net Primary Production (NPP), one of the most important
   and integrative ecosystem attributes, through the calculation of Human
   Appropriation of NPP (HANPP), a very complete indicator of human impact
   on ecosystems. Our results provide a comprehensive and fine grained
   description of HANPP patterns over an entire biogeographycal region for
   two periods that encompass a strong agricultural intensification
   process. We used medium resolution land use maps and NPP estimates from
   sub-national level agricultural statistics and remotely sensed data
   modeling. Results show that the human impact on the energy flow in RPG
   ecosystems reached very high levels compared to other regions of the
   world. The average appropriation of was 42\% of the potential vegetation
   NPP in 2001/2002 and it increased 4.5\% during the last years due to an
   intense land use changes. Most of the HANPP was explained by harvest
   rather than by land use changes, mainly in the last period due to crops
   yield increase and the expansion of double crop system as a common
   agronomic practice. High HANPP values found were associated to a set of
   environmental impacts that affect ecosystems sustainability and their
   ability to provide ecosystem services.}},

   in terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, we do not know how general
   biodiversity responses are among ecosystem types. We examined the role
   of insect herbivore (Orthoptera) diversity on plant production using
   parallel field experiments in three grassland ecosystems (mixed grass
   prairie, tallgrass prairie and coastal tallgrass prairie) to determine
   whether the effects of grasshopper diversity were consistent among
   sites. Using mesocosms, we manipulated orthopteran species richness (0,
   1, 2, 3 or 4 species), functional richness (number of functional feeding
   groups present; 0, 1 or 2 functional groups) and functional composition
   (composition of functional groups present; mixed-feeders only,
   grass-feeders only, both mixed-feeders and grass-feeders). Diversity
   treatments were maintained throughout the experiment by replacing dead
   individuals. Plant biomass was destructively sampled at the end of the
   experiment. We found no effect of species richness or functional
   richness on plant biomass. However, herbivore functional composition was
   important, and effects were qualitatively similar across sites: The
   presence of only grass-feeding species reduced plant biomass more than
   either mixed-feeding species alone or both groups together. Orthopterans
   had consistent effects across a range of abiotic conditions, as well as
   different plant community and orthopteran community compositions. Our
   results suggest that functional composition of insect herbivores affects
   plant communities in grasslands more than herbivore species richness or
   functional richness, and this pattern was robust among grassland types.}},

Title = {{Artificial light at night causes top-down and bottom-up trophic effects

Abstract = {{1. Globally, many ecosystems are exposed to artificial light at night.
   Nighttime lighting has direct biological impacts on species at all
   trophic levels. However, the effects of artificial light on biotic
   interactions remain, for the most part, to be determined.
   2. We exposed experimental mesocosms containing combinations of
   grassland plants and invertebrate herbivores and predators to
   illumination at night over a 3-year period to simulate conditions under
   different common forms of street lighting.
   3. We demonstrate both top-down (predation-controlled) and bottom-up
   (resource-controlled) impacts of artificial light at night in grassland
   communities. The impacts on invertebrate herbivore abundance were
   wavelength-dependent and mediated via other trophic levels.
   4. White LED lighting decreased the abundance of a generalist herbivore
   mollusc by 55\% in the presence of a visual predator, but not in its
   absence, while monochromatic amber light (with a peak wavelength similar
   to low-pressure sodium lighting) decreased abundance of a specialist
   herbivore aphid (by 17\%) by reducing the cover and flower abundance of
   its main food plant in the system. Artificial white light also
   significantly increased the food plant's foliar carbon to nitrogen
   ratio.
   5. We conclude that exposure to artificial light at night can trigger
   ecological effects spanning trophic levels, and that the nature of such
   impacts depends on the wavelengths emitted by the lighting technology
   employed
   6. Policy implications. Our results confirm that artificial light at
   night, at illuminance levels similar to roadside vegetation, can have
   population effects mediated by both top-down and bottom-up effects on
   ecosystems. Given the increasing ubiquity of light pollution at night,
   these impacts may be widespread in the environment. These results
   underline the importance of minimizing ecosystem disruption by reducing
   light pollution in natural and seminatural ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Assessing the feasibility of carbon payments and Payments for Ecosystem
   Services to reduce livestock grazing pressure on saltmarshes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{225}},
Pages = {{46-61}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Saltmarshes provide important services including flood control, climate
   regulation, and provisioning services when grazed by livestock for
   agriculture and conservation purposes. Grazing diminishes aboveground
   carbon, creating a trade-off between these two services. Furthermore,
   saltmarshes are threatened by overgrazing. To provide saltmarsh
   protection and ensure the continuing delivery of ecosystem services,
   there is a need to incentivise land managers to stock environmentally
   sensible densities. We therefore investigated the possibility of
   agri-environmental schemes and Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) to
   compensate for lost livestock revenue under reduced grazing regimes and
   provide carbon sequestration and other benefits. This is the first study
   to consider the benefits arising from a potential carbon market to
   saltmarshes, although similar schemes exist for peatland and woodland.
   We calculated the net economic benefit (costs of livestock production
   are removed from revenue) to farmers obtained from a hectare of grazed
   saltmarsh under low (0.3 Livestock Units per hectare per year), moderate
   (0.6), high (1.0) and very high (2.0) stocking densities accounting for
   livestock revenue, carbon benefits, and agri-environmental subsidies. We
   repeated the procedure considering additional benefits transferred from
   the literature in terms of provisioning, regulating and cultural
   ecosystem services provided by protected saltmarshes. The net benefits
   were assessed for a range of market carbon prices and social costs of
   carbon, e.g. the opportunity cost of carbon for society. Applying the
   model to Scottish saltmarshes we find that the current range of market
   prices could prompt transitions from high to moderate regimes in areas
   where livestock value is low, however break-even prices for transitions
   showed high spatial variability due to spatial variability in livestock
   values. In some areas of the West Highlands, the break-even carbon price
   is negative, indicating that the current agri-environmental schemes are
   able to more than compensate for the lost revenue accruing to farmers by
   a reduced grazing density. However, in other areas, such as the Outer
   Hebrides, the breakeven carbon price is positive. Private PES schemes or
   increased public subsidies should then be provided to generate net
   benefits. It is reasonable to infer that a pure carbon market may have
   limited scope in incentivising consumers to buy carbon services,
   especially in areas with limited local number of buyers and corporates
   of small size. Under this circumstance, a premium carbon market offering
   bundled ecosystem services may help reduce grazing pressure across a
   larger number of Scottish saltmarshes, thereby providing globally
   important climate regulation services and at the same time protecting
   sensitive habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock breeding and production activities provide the livelihood for
   herdsmen; nevertheless, the accompanying trampling has the potential to
   negatively influence the physiochemical environment of soil. The policy
   of returning grazing land to grassland has greatly influenced both
   biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, the regulatory mechanism
   behind changes of soil infiltration capacity remains largely unexplored.
   Here, three sites (a 1-year {[}R1] and a 3-year {[}R3] restoration of
   grassland, which were both trampled areas and trails an untrampled
   grassland) were sampled on the Mongolian Plateau of China. The
   infiltration parameters, soil properties, root channel area, and plant
   community were determined for each site. The results showed that the
   species richness, aboveground biomass, and the proportion of forbs in
   the R3 grassland were 2.7-, 5.5- and 30.8-times higher than those of the
   R1 grassland, respectively. The soil infiltration rates and cumulative
   infiltration increased with species richness, aboveground biomass, and
   the proportion of forbs. Importantly, all values of species richness,
   aboveground biomass, and forbs ratio increased with progressing
   restoration. Overall, our results indicate that grasses recovered first
   after trampling ceased. Along with the improvement of soil surface
   conditions, forb species with greater root channel area increased
   gradually, which increased the soil infiltration rate. Our research
   highlights the changes in plant community of trampled areas and trails
   and the regulatory influence of revegetation on soil infiltration.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing exclusion (GE) is regarded as an effective practice to restore
   degraded grasslands. However, the patterns of vegetation recovery and
   related regulating factors in response to fencing have not been fully
   recognized. Hence, quantitative analysis of vegetation-soil
   relationships in response to GE was conducted in a semiarid grassland
   located on the Loess Plateau, North China. The results revealed that
   enclosure establishment significantly increased vegetation cover,
   height, and productivity but reduced plant diversity. Soil bulk density
   (0-20 cm) and pH (0-50 cm) clearly decreased after GE, whereas soil
   water (0-20 cm), organic matter (0-10 cm and 30-40 cm), and nutrient
   concentration (0-20 cm) increased significantly. Redundancy analysis of
   vegetation and environmental variables suggested that edaphic
   properties, including soil water, soil pH, total N, bulk density, and
   organic matter, was associated with plant community composition.
   Subsequent canonical correlation analysis indicated that soil bulk
   density, organic matter, and total N played an important role in shaping
   vegetation patterns in response to fencing whereas variations in soil pH
   and total N were the major contributors to variations in grazing
   rangeland. This work emphasized that fencing is a positive grassland
   management approach and suitable changes in grazing stock and soil
   variability are required to quantify vegetation recovery in response to
   grazing exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{The ecological importance of the common hippopotamus (Hippopotamus
   amphibius) in aquatic ecosystems is becoming increasingly well known.
   These unique megaherbivores are also likely to have a formative
   influence on the terrestrial ecosystems in which they forage. In this
   study, we employed a novel exclosure design to exclude H. amphibius from
   experimental plots on near-river grasslands. Our three-year
   implementation of this experiment revealed a substantial influence of H.
   amphibius removal on both plant communities and soil chemistry. H.
   amphibius significantly reduced grassland canopy height, increased the
   leafiness of common grasses, reduced woody plant abundance and size, and
   increased the concentrations of several soil elements. Many of the soil
   chemistry changes that we experimentally induced by exclusion of H.
   amphibius were mirrored in the soil chemistry differences between
   naturally occurring habitats of frequent (grazing lawns) and infrequent
   (shrub forest) use by H. amphibius and other grazing herbivores. In
   contrast to existing hypotheses regarding grazing species, we found that
   H. amphibius had little effect on local plant species richness.
   Simultaneous observations of exclosures designed to remove all large
   herbivores revealed that H. amphibius removal had ecologically
   significant impacts, but that the removal of all species of large
   herbivores generated more pronounced impacts than the removal of H.
   amphibius alone. In aggregate, our results suggest that H. amphibius
   have myriad effects on their terrestrial habitats that likely improve
   the quality of forage available for other herbivores. We suggest that
   ongoing losses of this vulnerable megaherbivore are likely to cause
   significant ecological change.}},

   richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity (H) and evenness from the second to
   the fourth year, however, surprisingly, increased them in the sixth and
   seventh year. The reversal in the response of diversity to N addition
   was explained by changes in grass dominance and standing litter
   accumulation. The diversity recovery during later years in fertilized
   plots was attributed to a decrease in the dominant grass and an increase
   in standing litter: standing litter reduced bud numbers of the dominant
   grass by decreasing light availability. The decreased light availability
   by standing litter reduced completion from the dominant species, which
   resulted in diversity increase. The negative feedback between dominant
   grasses and standing litter led to transient N-induced diversity loss in
   the short-term, but recovery of plant diversity in the long-term.
   Grassland management that affects litter accumulation, such as firing,
   grazing and mowing, can therefore, have substantial effects on the
   long-term response of plant diversity to N deposition.}},

Abstract = {{Management of semi-natural grasslands should be based on the
   requirements of plants as well as their pollinators since conditions
   beneficial for plants are not necessarily beneficial for their
   pollinators and vice versa. The factors affecting the reproductive
   success (fruit set) of Platanthera bifolia and Platanthera chlorantha
   and their pollinators in agricultural landscape and woodlands were
   studied. In the years 2014-2016, we observed and caught moths during the
   flowering period of Platanthera species (late June-mid July) in four
   pure P. bifolia, five pure P. chlorantha and nine mixed populations
   under management or no management in Estonia. We determined pollinator
   species richness, pollinator abundance, fruit set and visibility of
   Platanthera plants in each population. We found that pollinator
   assemblages of P. bifolia and P. chlorantha did not differ between
   managed and unmanaged sites. Pollinator abundance had an effect on the
   fruit set of P. bifolia but not on that of P. chlorantha. Presence or
   absence of management, visibility of plants and rarefied pollinator
   species richness did not affect the fruit set of either plant species.
   Pollinator abundance was significantly higher in unmanaged populations
   of both plant species but rarefied pollinator species richness was
   higher only in unmanaged populations of P. chlorantha. Based on our
   findings the recommendations for management of semi-natural grasslands
   are to promote larger landscape diversity for the benefit of moth
   abundance by leaving unmanaged patches in different parts of a grassland
   in different years and rotational and post-fruiting management for
   higher reproductive success of orchids.}},

Abstract = {{Land use is increasingly important for impact assessment in life cycle
   assessment (LCA). Its impacts on biodiversity and provision of ecosystem
   services are crucial to depict the environmental performance of
   products. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models are commonly
   selected by consensus through processes frequently misinformed by the
   absence of practical application studies. Here, we performed an
   assessment of all free and peer-reviewed LCIA models for land use. We
   started with spatial correlation analysis at the country scale. Models
   that use the same indicators are strongly correlated, suggesting that
   regionalization is no longer a decisive issue in model selection. We
   applied these models in a case study for cattle production where feeds
   are replaced by sown biodiverse pastures (SBP). We tested (1) a
   non-regionalized inventory from an LCA database and, (2) a regionalized
   inventory that explicit considered the locations of land occupation and
   transformation. We found the same qualitative result: the installation
   of SBP avoids impacts due to feed substitution. Each hectare of SBP
   installed avoids the occupation of 0.5 hectares per year for feed
   ingredient production. Adding inventory regionalization for 70\% of land
   use flows leads to a change of 15\% in results, suggesting limited
   spatial differentiation between country-level characterization factors.}},

Title = {{Do mowing regimes affect plant and soil biological activity in the

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},

Pages = {{2409-2421}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The soil biological activity of mountain meadows is a significant factor
   that determines the health and utility of these regions. The climax
   stage of this area is forest, but to maintain semi-natural grassland,
   which is characterised by high biodiversity, low-intensity land use
   (mowing or grazing) is necessarily required. To understand the effect of
   various mowing regimes on the soil biological activity and plants, the
   soil microbial activity (microbial biomass carbon, dehydrogenase
   activity and number of the cultivable fraction of soil microbial
   community), annelids community (density and species composition
   earthworms and enchytraeids) and plant species composition were
   investigated. The study area was located in the Pieniny National Park in
   the Carpathian Mountains, in a meadow belonging to the association
   Dactylis glomerata-Poa trivialis. The investigated variants were divided
   according to mowing regime: traditional scything - hand mowing (HM),
   mechanical mowing (MM), or the abandonment of mowing - non-mowing (NM).
   The microbial activities (expressed by, e.g. microbial biomass carbon
   and the number of phosphorus bacteria) were affected by the mowing
   regime. The density of earthworms was higher in the HM and MM than in
   the NM variants. The largest changes in plant species composition were
   caused by the abandonment of mowing (NM). The mean number of plant
   species was positively correlated with soil moisture, earthworm density,
   and microbial activity (expressed indirectly by dehydrogenases
   activity). The soil microbial community, such as vegetative bacteria
   forms and ammonifying bacteria, were positively associated with pH
   value, and the microbial and total organic carbon content. The results
   presented here indicate that there is no single form of optimal
   management for all living organisms. Decisions about mowing regimes, or
   abandonment of use, should be preceded by multi-aspect studies,
   including plants and soil biota.}},

Abstract = {{Fire is a major disturbance in ecosystems that generally promotes
   secondary succession in forests.This study was conducted to track
   changes in a moth assemblage at a high elevation site before and after
   fire. A fire destroyed about 2 ha of the conifer and mixed deciduous
   forest and grassland of Sasa quelpaertensis Nakai, 1933 (Poales:
   Poaceae) on Mt. Hallasan, Jejudo Island, South Korea. I monitored the
   moth assemblages of the burned site and three neighboring sites across 5
   yr (2011, 2013-2016) using an ultraviolet light trap. There was a
   decline in species richness and abundance, and increased dissimilarity
   at the burned site relative to the neighboring sites. However, the moth
   assemblage at the burned site recovered quickly, within 3 yr of the
   fire. I also identified three indicator species that characterized the
   moth assemblage of the burned site: Anaplectoides virens Butler, 1878
   (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Martania saxea Wileman, 1911 (Lepidoptera:
   Geometridae), and Catocala dissimilis Bremer, 1861 (Lepidoptera,
   Erebidae). Host plant information regarding these three species
   coincided with the early succession of the forest following the fire. In
   addition, the disappearance of a once dominant species at the burned
   site, Hydrillodes morosa Butler, 1879 (Lepidoptera: Erebidae), suggested
   that the fire and succession after the fire changed the interactions
   between plants and their herbivores. The fire impacted the moth
   assemblage through changes in species composition; however, the moth
   assemblage recovered quickly, even in an unfavorable habitats such as a
   high elevation site.}},

Abstract = {{The study examines the relationship between Ecosystem Services (ES)
   supply and vegetation dynamics through a series of five vegetation types
   representing a hypothetical successional sequence (i.e., Grassland,
   Pine, Pine-Oak mix, Open Oak, Dense Oak). We quantified and compared the
   dependence of local livelihood on provisioning services from forests at
   each level of succession and the resource extraction methods used to
   obtain desired products through a structured social survey covering 19
   villages and 702 households in Tehri Garhwal and Dehradun districts of
   Uttarakhand. We found that broad leaved oak forests (covering 38.5\% of
   total 57,516ha of the study area) were the most important vegetation
   formation supporting local livelihoods. Meanwhile, the extraction of
   services from other early successional vegetation formations was
   significantly lower than oak forests, both in terms of number and
   quantities. Notably, the highest dependence was on fuel wood, fodder,
   and stall inlay (animal bedding), most of which were provided by dense
   oak forests. The high dependence on vegetation to support household
   needs and subsequent resource extraction through grazing, lopping,
   cutting, collection, and fire, act as unsystematic management techniques
   in the study area, maintaining the vegetation in its present form. An
   understanding of ecosystem service supply from each level of succession
   and the resource extraction methods used to obtain desired services can
   assist forest managers to choose the best suited management regime
   depending on their aim and stakeholder demands.}},

Abstract = {{Rotational grazing is sometimes promoted for grassland bird
   conservation, but the benefits to wildlife have not been comprehensively
   documented. We examined effects of twice-over rotational grazing on
   nesting success of grassland songbirds in southwestern Manitoba, Canada

   collected structural vegetation data in 2011 (during a 1/300 flood
   event), and 2012 (average water levels), for five species of obligate
   grassland bird species (n=110) and one shrub-nesting species (n=41).
   Nesting analyses were conducted using logistic exposure models. Nesting
   success was 2.4 to 4 times lower in twice-over grazed pastures
   comparedwith season-long grazed pastures, perhaps because of the
   increased cattle density during the short grazing periods of the
   twice-over system. Nests protected by shrubs from grazing activities of
   cattle did not show this pattern. The grazing system did not have an
   effect on vegetation structure. This suggests that twice-over rotational
   grazing does not benefit grassland songbirds in northern mixed-grass
   prairies, and that caution must be taken before implementing this
   grazing system in areas intended to promote biodiversity conservation.

Abstract = {{Grazing by large herbivores leads to changes in soil properties which
   can in turn modify plant performance. However, little is known about how
   competition among plant species alters the strength and direction of
   grazing induced plant-soil feedbacks (PSFs). In a previous monoculture
   experiment, we found that the intensity of sheep grazing generated
   consistent abiotic feedback effects and species-specific biotic feedback
   effects. To test if and how interspecific plant competition modifies the
   PSFs observed in our previous monoculture experiment, five
   naturally-occurring plant species (Artemisia capillaris, Dodnrtia
   orientalis, Lespedeza davurica, Oxybropis racemosa, and Stipa bungeana)
   were grown in mixed communities in sterilized and unsterilized soils
   from plots of four grazing intensities (0, 2.7, 5.3, and 8.7 sheep/ha).
   Further, the five plant species were grown in mixtures in
   treatment-specific soil following inoculation with arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi (AM) and/or a mixture of pathogenic Fusarium species
   (FU), to test the contribution of these two fungal groups to biotic
   PSFs. All plant species experienced net neutral to positive abiotic and
   biotic PSFs. Compared with our previous monoculture experiment, we found
   that the presence of interspecific competition did not change the
   abiotic PSF effects generated with increasing grazing intensity, but
   shifted the direction and strength of the biotic PSFs generated within
   each grazing intensity. The presence of pathogenic Fusarium-only
   significantly decreased the proportional biomass of the dominant species
   A. capillaris and S. bungeana, and the presence of AM fungi-only
   significantly increased the proportional biomass of the subordinate
   species D. orientalis and O. racemosa. Our study strongly suggests that
   in grazed ecosystems interspecific competition and biotic PSFs interact
   to drive plant community dynamics, and also that soil mutualists such as
   AM fungi have the potential to promote plant species coexistence by
   facilitating the performance of subordinate species.}},

   rotations that include legumes and/or mixed forage; utilisation of

   beneficial because it adds to biodiversity and expands marketing

Title = {{Impact of an invasive herbivore and human trampling on lichen-rich dry
   grasslands: Soil-dependent response of multiple taxa}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{639}},
Pages = {{633-639}},
Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Dry grasslands are listed among the habitats of conservation concern in
   Europe. Here, based on a multitaxon approach including vascular plants,
   bryophytes and lichens, we explored the effects of small-scale
   disturbance on lichen-rich dry grassland vegetation by surveying 60
   sites across the Po Plain (Northern Italy). In particular, we evaluated
   the impact of human trampling and fecal pellet deposition by the alien
   invasive herbivore Sylvilagus floridanus. We found a soil-dependent
   response of multiple taxa to the impact of the herbivore. For plants,
   beside a negative effect of trampling, the interaction between fecal
   pellet amount and soil pH indicates that the negative effect of the
   invasive herbivore is stronger on acidic soils. Bryophyte cover
   increased with increasing soil pH, annual rainfall and fecal pellet,
   while it was not affected by trampling. Lichen richness and cover
   decreased with increasing soil pH. The marginal interaction between soil
   pH and amount of fecal pellet indicates that the more negative effects
   on lichens may be expected on calcareous soils. Trampling did not affect
   lichen patterns and the rainfall gradient marginally affected lichen
   cover with a negative effect. Lichen species richness is also negatively
   affected by increasing vascular plant cover. The main implications of
   this study for improving conservation are: (1) conservation practices
   should be tailored to organism and substrate type; (2) bryophyte and
   lichen diversity patterns are influenced also by climatic conditions,
   suggesting that the impact on these organisms may be exacerbated by
   climate change; and (3) strict conservation, even through active
   exclusion of wild fauna, of the most species-rich sites should be
   recommended, even if previous literature and the negative plant
   cover-lichen richness relationship found in this study indicate that
   moderate mechanical disturbance could be a practical tool to enhance
   cryptogams. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{While positive interactions have been well documented in plant and
   sessile benthic marine communities, their role in structuring mobile
   animal communities and underlying mechanisms has been less explored.
   Using field removal experiments, we demonstrated that a large vertebrate
   herbivore (cattle; Bos tarurs) and a much smaller invertebrate (ants;
   Lasius spp.), the two dominant animal taxa in a semi-arid grassland in
   Northeast China, facilitate each other. Cattle grazing led to higher ant
   mound abundance compared with ungrazed sites, while the presence of ant
   mounds increased the foraging of cattle during the peak of the growing
   season. Mechanistically, these reciprocal positive effects were driven
   by habitat amelioration and resource (food) enhancement by cattle and
   ants (respectively). Cattle facilitated ants, probably by decreasing
   plant litter accumulation by herbivory and trampling, allowing more
   light to reach the soil surface leading to microclimatic conditions that
   favour ants. Ants facilitated cattle probably by increasing soil
   nutrients via bioturbation, increasing food (plant) biomass and quality
   (nitrogen content) for cattle. Our study demonstrates reciprocal
   facilitative interactions between two animal species from
   phylogenetically very distant taxa. Such reciprocal positive
   interactions may be more common in animal communities than so far
   assumed, and they should receive more attention to improve our
   understanding of species coexistence and animal community assembly.}},

Title = {{How should we view temperate semi-natural grasslands? Insights from
   butterflies in Japan}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In humid temperate regions, it has been commonly thought that closed
   forests represent original states and grasslands are unstable human
   artifacts that persist only as ``semi-natural{''} states. This
   perspective underrates grasslands, because it makes the recent decline
   in grassland excusable. A contrasting perspective was recently proposed
   for temperate Europe and North America, stating that grasslands are
   intrinsically natural and stable, and hence could have survived without
   human presence during the postglacial age. However, few quantitative
   analyses have been performed to test the validity of these two
   perspectives. Considering that the evolutionary history of species is
   reflected in species traits, analyzing traits of grassland species in
   relation to habitat stability is expected to identify the intrinsic
   nature of grasslands (stable or unstable) and test the validity of these
   two perspectives. Here, using temperate Japanese butterflies, I compared
   ecological traits, geographic range, endemism and habitat types in the
   Eurasian continent between grassland species and forest (stable habitat)
   and ruderal (unstable habitat) species. I found that grassland
   butterflies shared similar ecological traits with forest butterflies,
   but not with ruderal butterflies. Moreover, grassland butterflies were
   primarily associated with natural and stable steppes and meadows in the
   Eurasian continent. Furthermore, Japanese grassland species are
   evolutionarily unique, nurturing many endemic subspecies with narrow
   geographic ranges. These results indicate that grasslands should not be
   regarded as unstable, transient, and artificial, but as intrinsically
   natural and stable in humid temperate regions. These grasslands may have
   persisted in a stable state without human intervention during the
   Holocene due to natural disturbances and severe environmental
   conditions, which are currently immensely suppressed or altered by
   human. Such perspective also holds true for humid temperate regions in
   Europe and North America. Thus, temperate semi-natural grasslands should
   be conserved with high priority in these regions considering that few
   natural grasslands are left resulting from the present intensive land
   use pressures and disturbance suppression. (C) 2018 The Author.

Abstract = {{Pasture and grazing land is one of the dominant global land-uses in the
   Anthropocene. There are two broad strategies for preserving phylogenetic
   diversity (PD) within livestock regions: land sharing, which increases
   farmland heterogeneity at the expense of yield and forest cover, and
   land sparing, which increases forest cover and yields at the expense of
   farmland heterogeneity. We assessed the relative merits of the two
   strategies in the context of preserving dung beetle PD in twenty 1-km(2)
   livestock landscapes in a Neotropical biodiversity hotspot. We
   calculated six complementary metrics of PD: phylogenetic richness
   ((DT)-D-0)), divergence (D-2(T), MPD and MNTD) and structure (NRI and
   NTI). Dung beetle density varied irrespective of forest cover, cattle
   yield and farmland heterogeneity, but phylogenetic richness and
   divergence decreased in more deforested landscapes, resulting in reduced
   phylogenetic dispersion closer to the tips (i.e. higher relatedness
   within genera). Similarly, increased net cattle yield resulted in
   reduced phylogenetic richness and divergence (except MNTD), but had a
   weaker effect on phylogenetic structure. While farmland heterogeneity
   had no significant effect on phylogenetic metrics, model selection
   indicated that forest cover was more important than livestock
   intensification in determining dung beetle PD. To avoid losing
   evolutionary lineages of dung beetles and increase cattle yield, we
   recommend implementing land sparing in the region by concentrating
   cattle production i.e. producing the same yield on a smaller area of
   land through intensification to set aside more land for forest
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the impacts of livestock grazing is crucial to rangeland
   management and conservation. Numerous indicators have been employed to
   detect differences caused by grazing, while case studies suggest that
   effects differ among individual indicator systems. Across Tibetan
   pastures that have evolved with long grazing histories and harbour high
   levels of biodiversity, we tested: (I) whether commonly used grazing
   indicators differ in their sensitivity to grazing and environmental
   conditions, and (2) the relative importance of grazing and abiotic
   factors in controlling effects on indicators.
   Our sampling covered 18 sites within two main grassland types (steppe
   and meadow). We compared species compositions among communities of
   plants, small mammals and ants, as well as overall soil chemical
   conditions and field hyperspectral reflectance data using multivariate
   analyses between two qualitative levels of grazing intensity (heavy vs.
   light). Using univariate Generalized Linear Models, we explored the
   effects of grazing intensity, grassland type and their interaction on
   the richness and abundance of biotic groups as well as values of key
   soil and hyperspectral indices. The major environmental factors tested
   included temperature, precipitation, elevation, relief, exposure and
   inclination.
   Few of the indicators differed under relatively heavy grazing, including
   reductions in vegetation cover, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen
   concentration and two hyperspectral indices. Indicator groups differed
   both quantitatively and qualitatively with respect to grazing and
   climate impacts. Grazing effects were evident in the moist Kobresia
   meadows of eastern Tibet, while environmental controls dominated in
   alpine steppes of the drier western part of the plateau. Grazing effects
   on indicators thus depended on local precipitation conditions.
   Multivariate species compositions were affected by abiotic factors in
   all biotic indicator groups: precipitation was the most influential
   abiotic factor affecting plant species composition, overall soil
   nutrients and hyper spectral data, while elevation and temperature
   influenced ant and small mammal communities in terms of richness and
   species composition.
   Our results do not support the notion that local increases in relative
   grazing intensity have strong effects on the species richness of key
   biotic indicator groups across all Tibetan pastures. Reliable
   assessments of grazing effects thus require both multiple appropriate
   indicators and careful calibration to account for local climate and
   topographic conditions. Differences between principal grassland types
   must be acknowledged for future grassland conservation and management.}},

Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{265}},
Pages = {{15-21}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Land use intensification caused severe population declines in many
   grassland bird species. For the Corncrake, a multi-brooded,
   ground-breeding rail that inhabits mostly agricultural grassland, more
   frequent mowing at earlier dates is a threat to nests and broods and
   induces dispersal of adults. We used an occupancy model that allows for
   staggered arrival and departure times to estimate within-season
   movements of male Corncrakes and analysed how departure probabilities,
   calling site occupancy and habitat suitability were affected by land
   use. This study covered two study periods before (1998-2000) and after
   (2012-2015) a change in the local management regime. Male Corncrakes
   showed continuous arrival and departure during the breeding season, but
   delayed mowing dates reduced departure probability in the second study
   period, which should enhance the probability for second broods because
   less calling sites were affected by mowing especially during early July.
   Late mowing, however, implies economical losses for farmers and
   cessation of land use expanded. On unused meadows litter heights
   increased and plant species richness and forb cover declined, thus
   preferred habitat conditions deteriorated. Calling sites in unmanaged
   meadows were abandoned by male Corncrakes after few years without land
   use. Postponing first mowing dates until broods fledge is effective in
   protecting Corncrake broods, because more chicks should have survived
   until fledging but habitat quality depends on annual management. Because
   currently mowing late in the season is unattractive to farmers, we
   suggest that future Corncrake habitat conservation should along with
   financial compensations promote and evaluate the utilization of late-cut
   biomass for energy production.}},

Abstract = {{The desert steppe is a large component of the semi-arid grassland
   ecosystem in northern China, and provides significant resources for
   livestock production. However, overgrazing is regarded as one of main
   causes of its degradation and desertification over recent decades.
   Quantifying the direct and indirect effects of grazing disturbance on
   plant community productivity in the desert steppe ecosystem can provide
   insights into appropriate measures for the restoration of degraded
   grassland and biodiversity conservation. Here, we examine the effects of
   four grazing intensity treatments: no grazing (control), light grazing
   (LG), moderate grazing (MG) and heavy grazing (HG) on the plant
   community and soil nutrients with sheep grazing over 12 years in a
   desert steppe in Inner Mongolia, northern China. The results showed that
   increasing grazing intensity resulted in decreased species richness,
   Shannon-Wiener and Pielou's index, as well as above- and belowground
   biomass. Soil moisture, nitrogen, available potassium and soil organic
   carbon were not affected (P > 0.05) by grazing disturbance. In addition,
   grazing disturbance had a greater indirect effect on aboveground biomass
   via plant diversity. Consequently, plant diversity is a key indirect
   factor that determines community productivity in response to grazing
   disturbance. Reducing grazing pressure can contribute to maintaining
   relatively high species diversity and productivity in the desert steppe
   of northern China.}},

   shrub removal in mixed hardwood forests}},
Journal = {{APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{75-88}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Invasive woody plant species are a threat to biodiversity and ecosystem
   function in forests of the eastern U.S., due in part to their effects on
   soil properties and nutrient cycling. Controlling invasive shrubs can
   benefit the ecosystem at multiple scales, but these species tend to
   resprout when cut, and post-cuffing flushes of root exudates have been
   linked to accelerated decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM), a
   rhizosphere priming effect. We removed the invasive shrub Lonicera
   maackii (Rupr.) Herder (Amur honeysuckle) from forested sites in central
   Indiana, USA, using cut-stump and forestry mulching head treatments. For
   two growing seasons after the initial removal treatments, we compared
   the soil chemistry and microbial community function of bulk and
   honeysuckle rhizosphere soils in shrub removal areas to those in invaded
   reference areas. Microbial activity measured using multiple substrate
   induced respiration (MSIR) in bulk soils was generally lower in removal
   areas than reference areas the first year, coinciding with relatively
   elevated responses in the rhizosphere soils of resprouting shrubs.
   Elevated SOM and organic C in rhizosphere soils of resprouting shrubs
   suggested a flush of rhizodeposits from cutting and regrowth. However,
   bulk soil chemistry responses to shrub removal did not show any evidence
   of a rhizosphere priming effect, but instead reflected the reduced
   effects of honeysuckle on throughfall precipitation chemistry-higher
   ammonium and lower magnesium. Nonetheless, changes in bulk soil
   chemistry between years were driven by the chemical characteristics of
   rhizosphere soil associated with resprouting honeysuckle. This study is
   the first to document the potential for invasive shrub control to affect
   soil properties through rhizodeposition by the target species.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Aim: The implementation of Grazing Management Plans (GMP), a specific
   policy and management tool, aimed at enhancing farm productivity while
   preserving plant diversity, soil and landscape. The GMP are based on
   rotational grazing systems (RGS) with animal stocking rate adjusted to
   balance grassland carrying capacity. The aim was to test the 5-year
   effects produced by GMP implementation on botanical composition, plant
   diversity and soil nutrient content on sub-alpine and alpine pastures.
   Location: Val Troncea Natural Park, western Italian Alps.
   Methods: A total of 199 vegetation transects was carried out in summer
   2011 and repeated in summer 2016. The botanical composition was recorded
   and plant diversity indices, i.e. species richness and Shannon diversity
   (H ` index), were computed. Mean soil nutrient content was indirectly
   estimated through computation of Landolt N indicator value (N index) for
   each transect. Pair-sample statistical tests and PERMANOVA were perfomed
   at different levels: on the whole vegetation dataset, on vegetation
   communities (i.e. vegetation types and ecological groups) and
   considering functional pools of species.
   Results: Considering the whole vegetation dataset, species richness, H `
   index and N index significantly increased from 2011 to 2016. Moreover,
   species richness significantly increased in almost all vegetation
   ecological groups, with the highest increase within the mesotrophic
   group. The H ` index significantly increased in eutrophic, pre-forest
   and thermic groups, while the N index increased in all vegetation
   groups, except in the eutrophic and snow-bed groups. A significant
   difference in botanical composition was detected within oligotrophic,
   mesotrophic and thermic groups. The number and cover of N-poor
   high-elevation species increased in all groups and this result might be
   related to effects produced by livestock, which promoted seed transport
   and increased connectivity amongst different communities. The
   meso-eutrophic species number and cover significantly increased within
   thermic, mesotrophic and pre-forest groups, suggesting greater use of
   such areas by livestock under RGS than under continuous grazing.
   Conclusions: The implementation of RGS with stocking rate adjustments
   proved to be an effective and a sustainable management tool to enhance
   botanical composition and plant diversity of sub-alpine and alpine
   grasslands over a 5-year span.}},

Abstract = {{The ruderal strategy is widely shared among non-native plants, providing
   a general explanation for the commonly observed positive effects of
   disturbance on invasions. How native ruderals respond to disturbance and
   how their abundance compares to that of non-native ruderals remains,
   however, poorly understood. Similarly, little is known about the role
   that disturbance type plays in the coexistence between native and
   non-native ruderals. We proposed that natural disturbance favors native
   over non-native ruderals, whereas novel anthropogenic disturbance favors
   non-natives over natives. To assess our general hypothesis, we conducted
   extensive field samplings in which we measured relative abundance,
   richness, and diversity of native and non-native ruderals in sites with
   natural and anthropogenic disturbance in central Argentina, a system
   where the ruderal strategy is common to a large number of native and
   non-native species. We found that natives dominated ruderal communities
   growing in recently burned grasslands, whereas non-natives dominated in
   roadsides. Additionally, the richness and diversity of native ruderal
   species were much greater than those of non-natives in sites with fire
   and in sites with grazing, but species richness and diversity did not
   differ between groups in roadsides. Because vegetation evolved with fire
   in our system and, in contrast, the construction and maintenance of
   roads is recent in it, these results support our hypothesis. Our work
   indicates that the ruderal strategy does not seem to suffice to explain
   why disturbance facilitates invasions. According to our data, species
   origin interacts with disturbance type to determine dominance in
   communities with coexisting native and non-native ruderals.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic global warming, nitrogen addition, and overgrazing alter
   plant communities and threaten plant biodiversity, potentially impacting
   community productivity, especially in sensitive mountain grassland
   ecosystems. However, it still remains unknown whether the relationship
   between plant biodiversity and community productivity varies across
   different anthropogenic influences, and especially how changes in
   multiple biodiversity facets drive these impacts on productivity. Here,
   we measured different facets of biodiversity including functional and
   phylogenetic richness and evenness in mountain grasslands along an
   environmental gradient of elevation in Yulong Mountain, Yunnan, China.
   We combined biodiversity metrics in a series of linear mixed-effect
   models to determine the most parsimonious predictors for productivity,
   which was estimated by aboveground biomass in community. We examined how
   biodiversity-productivity relationships were affected by experimental
   warming, nitrogen addition, and livestock-grazing. Species richness,
   phylogenetic diversity, and single functional traits (leaf nitrogen
   content, mg/g) represented the most parsimonious combination in these
   scenarios, supporting a consensus that single-biodiversity metrics alone
   cannot fully explain ecosystem function. The biodiversity-productivity
   relationships were positive and strong, but the effects of treatment on
   biodiversity-productivity relationship were negligible. Our findings
   indicate that the strong biodiversity-productivity relationships are
   consistent in various anthropogenic drivers of environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{In the Palaearctic steppe zone, overgrazing was identified as one of the
   key drivers of declining grassland biodiversity, which underlines the
   necessity of the functional evaluation of increased grazing pressure on
   grassland vegetation. We tested the following hypotheses: (a) The effect
   of grazing intensity on species and functional diversity is strongly
   dependent on grassland type. (b) The magnitude of diet selectivity of
   grazers decreases with increasing grazing intensity. (c) Increasing
   grazing intensity increases evenness and functional evenness of the
   subjected grasslands. We analyzed vegetation patterns in four types of
   grasslands (Dry alkali short-grass steppes, Dry loess steppes,
   Non-alkali wet and Alkali wet grasslands) along an intensity gradient of
   beef cattle grazing at 73 sites in Hungary. Species richness, Shannon
   diversity, evenness, and four leaf traits were analyzed. We calculated
   community-weighted means for each single trait, and multi-trait
   functional richness, functional evenness, and divergence for all leaf
   traits. All species and functional diversity metrics were significantly
   affected by the grassland type, except leaf dry matter content. The
   effect of interaction between grazing intensity and grassland type was
   also significant for functional richness, functional evenness,
   community-weighted means of leaf area, and for species richness and
   evenness. An upward trend of specific leaf area was detected in all
   grasslands with the highest scores for the overgrazed sites, but the
   change was also grassland type dependent. The detected trend suggests
   that with increased intensity the overall selectivity of grazing
   decreased. We found that evenness was affected but functional evenness
   was not affected by grazing intensity. Functional evenness scores were
   more related to the grassland type than to changes in grazing intensity,
   and displayed a high variability. We stress that one-size-fits-all
   strategies cannot be recommended and actions should be fine-tuned at
   least at the level of grassland type.}},

Title = {{Disturbance shapes avian communities on a grassland-sagebrush ecotone}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Ecotones, or transitional zones between ecosystems, are often hotspots
   for biodiversity and targets for conservation. Where the Great Plains
   meet the sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe, an opportunity exists to
   conserve habitat for the two most imperiled avian guilds in North
   America, grassland and shrub-steppe birds. This ecotone creates a unique
   challenge with respect to the management of disturbance processes, such
   as fire and grazing, because grassland and sagebrush-shrubland birds
   respond quite dissimilarly to disturbance. To address this management
   challenge and maximize conservation opportunities, we examined the
   responses of grassland and sagebrush bird communities to disturbance at
   a grassland-sagebrush ecotone in northeast Wyoming, USA. Specifically,
   we surveyed bird communities on active black-tailed prairie dog (Cynomys
   ludovicianus) colonies and burned areas, as well as on paired
   undisturbed points in 2016 and 2017. Bird community structure varied in
   response to both the presence and type of disturbance. Although alpha
   diversity of avian species was highest on undisturbed sites and burned
   areas, only prairie dog colonies provided breeding habitat for the
   imperiled shortgrass-obligate mountain plover (Charadrius montanus), and
   species turnover (beta diversity) was greatest between on-colony and
   off-colony points. Furthermore, bird communities were shaped by both
   disturbance-dependent (e.g., disturbance age) and
   disturbance-independent (e.g., topography and soils) landscape features.
   Managers must balance the benefits of high species diversity in
   undisturbed sagebrush with habitat requirements of other imperiled
   species like the mountain plover. This may entail prioritizing the
   amount and distribution of disturbances in relation to population goals
   for species of conservation concern while simultaneously maintaining a
   mosaic of all three patch types in this landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Mammalian grazing induces changes in vegetation properties in
   grasslands, which can affect a wide variety of other animals including
   many arthropods. However, the impacts may depend on the type and body
   size of these mammals. Furthermore, how mammals influence functional
   trait syndromes of arthropod communities is not well known. We
   progressively excluded large (e.g. red deer, chamois), medium (e.g.
   alpine marmot, mountain hare), and small (e.g. mice) mammals using
   size-selective fences in two vegetation types (short- and tall-grass
   vegetation) of subalpine grasslands. We then assessed how these
   exclusions affected the community composition and functional traits of
   ground beetles (Coleoptera, Carabidae), and which vegetation
   characteristic mediated the observed effects. Total carabid biomass, the
   activity densities of carabids with specific traits (i.e. small eyes,
   short wings), the richness of small-eyed species and the richness of
   herbivorous species were significantly higher when certain mammals were
   excluded compared to when all mammals had access, regardless of
   vegetation type. Excluding large and medium mammals increased the
   activity density of herbivorous carabid species, but only in short-grass
   vegetation. Similarly, excluding large mammals (ungulates) altered
   carabid species composition in the short-, but not in the tall-grass
   vegetation. All these responses were related to aboveground plant
   biomass, but not to plant Shannon diversity or vegetation structural
   heterogeneity. Our results indicate that changes in aboveground plant
   biomass are key drivers of mammalian grazers' influence on carabids,
   suggesting that bottom-up forces are important in subalpine grassland
   systems. The exclusion of ungulates provoked the strongest carabid
   response. Our results, however, also highlight the ecological
   significance of smaller herbivorous mammals. Our study furthermore shows
   that mammalian grazing not only altered carabid community composition,
   but also caused community-wide functional trait shifts, which could
   potentially have a wider impact on species interactions and ecosystem
   functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Abandonment of traditional farming practices, such as hay-making and
   pasturing, has resulted in rapid loss of open wet grassland habitats in
   Europe. The globally threatened Aquatic Warbler (Acrocephalus paludicola
   L.) is a bird species that occurs almost exclusively in open fen mires,
   which have virtually disappeared in Western Europe, but still persist
   locally in Eastern Europe. Focusing on the world's most important
   breeding site for Aquatic Warbler, the Zvaniec fen mire in Belarus, we
   estimated Belarusian citizens' willingness-to-pay for adequate
   conservation management of this fen mire and its focal species the
   Aquatic Warbler. Results from a discrete choice experiment indicated
   that Belarusian citizens were willing to pay for appropriate
   conservation programmes of the Zvaniec fen mire. Scything and mechanical
   mowing were preferred compared to controlled burning, and especially
   over herbicide treatment of encroaching shrubs. Conservation management
   was preferred over legal protection of wetland areas without management.
   Respondents considered such passive conservation to be insufficient to
   maintain open fen mire habitat and gave a higher priority to active
   conservation management programmes. These preferences are consistent
   with evidence-based knowledge about what is effective conservation
   management for the Aquatic Warbler. Given the gradual disappearance of
   Europe's traditional cultural landscapes, we discuss the challenge to
   fund the maintenance of this biocultural biodiversity legacy.}},

Title = {{Taxonomic and functional facets of the resilience to management of mown
   subalpine grasslands}},
Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Sustaining ecosystem services for society in the face of
   global change is a major challenge. Resilience, an ecosystem's ability
   to absorb disturbance and return to its initial functioning, is critical
   for this. We assessed the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands
   following restoration management. Using a novel multi-indicator
   approach, we asked how different taxonomic and functional facets of
   biodiversity influence resilience mechanisms. We demonstrated this
   approach for a case study in subalpine grasslands, asking: how resilient
   are grasslands dominated by Patzkea paniculata and their agronomic
   services to changing mowing regimes?
   Location: Villar d'Arene, Hautes-Alpes, Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur,
   France. Boundary area of Ecrins National Park.
   Methods: A manipulative experiment tested the reciprocal effects of
   mowing cessation and mowing resumption for 10 years. We analysed
   floristic composition data following four steps. First, we used the
   Community Structure Integrity Index (CSII; Jaunatre et al., ) to obtain
   qualitative and quantitative summaries of taxonomic responses. The
   second step focused on taxonomic biodiversity using species richness,
   Simpson and Pielou indices, and responsive species identified in the
   first step. Third, we analysed functional diversity responses using
   functional groups and community weighted mean (CWM) of vegetative plant
   traits. Finally, we quantified ecosystem services impacts by estimating
   fodder quantity and quality using trait-based models.
   Results: The mowing manipulation demonstrated the high resilience of P.
   paniculata grasslands and revealed reversibility of transitions between
   mown and unmown states. By reducing the abundance of P. paniculata, the
   resumption of mowing restored forage quality. Supported by a
   complementary case study on post-disturbance re-sowing in hay meadows,
   this study demonstrates the resilience of mown subalpine grasslands to
   management change and explores underlying belowground mechanisms of
   vegetative regeneration and belowground reserves.
   Conclusion: Our novel multi-indicator approach provides multifaceted
   mechanistic understanding necessary to anticipate impacts of
   socio-ecological changes and to maintain the multiple benefits of
   mountain grasslands. Addressing the different facets of biodiversity
   from abundance data that are systematically collected in impact or
   monitoring assessment, this approach provides a common framework, widely
   applicable to different types of restoration or management
   interventions, across regions and biota.}},

Abstract = {{Sandplain grassland and coastal heathland are globally rare communities
   threatened by succession, development, and shoreline change. Restricted
   mainly to coastal plains of the Northeast. they provide vital habitat
   for many state and regionally rare species, highlighting their
   importance for conservation and restoration. Brush-cutting and
   prescribed lire have been successful in maintaining these communities
   but have proven ineffective in converting overgrown shrubland to an
   earlier successional state. Previous research has established that the
   soil seed bank in overgrown shrubland lacks key dominant grassland
   species, and that while small-scale soil disturbance leads to short-term
   increases in grasses and forbs, woody species rapidly resume dominance.
   We examined whether applying larger-scale soil disturbance in an area
   previously treated with annual brush-cutting could more effectively
   impede woody regrowth while providing an extensive mineral soil seed bed
   to recruit desired vegetation. We evaluated the effectiveness of
   harrowing, harrowing plus seeding, and seeding alone, compared to
   untreated plots and to existing sandplain grassland and coastal
   heathland reference sites. Harrowing stimulated seed bank germination of
   varied native disturbance-associated species. including four
   Massachusetts state-listed rare species that recruited only within the
   harrowed area, and indicated that the seed bank lacked key grassland
   dominants. Comparison to reference grassland and heathland sites
   suggested that harrowing plus seeding more closely approached the
   desired restoration outcome than any other treatment. Our results
   suggest that larger-scale soil disturbance can enhance biodiversity by
   stimulating germination of native early successional plants from the
   seed bank while providing germination sites for sown target species.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed the effect of long-term (11years) mowing with a hand scythe
   on the distributions of plant species and species turnover within meadow
   communities dominated by Carex acutiformis and C. acuta in a small
   lowland river valley subjected to annual flooding. We hypothesized that
   mowing would trigger the process of species exchange toward multispecies
   communities according to the abiotic environmental gradients, as has
   been reported for traditionally used wet meadows. We found that mowing
   had a much greater impact on the increase in plant species abundance in
   wetter, subjected to deeper and longer flooding, zone of the valley than
   in its drier part. The treatment and hydrology had no substantial effect
   on the sedges and cryptogams while the graminoids and the forbs were the
   least stable components of the plant communities. We found that annual
   management was conducive to the appearance of numerous seedlings of
   Alnus glutinosa in the part of wetland situated close to the valley
   edge. Surface flooding was found to be a driving force modifying the
   impact of mowing on sedge meadows. This hydrological resetting impulse
   created a specific floristic reset of the community, bringing it to the
   more simplified forms. Mowing every 4-5years at the beginning of August
   is advisable to protect sedge meadows distributed in flooded small
   lowland river valleys.}},

Title = {{Fodder crop management benefits Northern Lapwing (Vanellus vanellus)
   outside agri-environment schemes}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{265}},
Pages = {{470-475}},

Abstract = {{To date, agri-environment schemes (AES) have had limited success in
   reversing biodiversity loss over greater spatial extents than fields and
   farms, and vary widely in their cost-effectiveness. Here, over nine
   years, we make use of the management initiative of a farmer in an upland
   livestock farming landscape in Scotland, undertaken wholly outside AES,
   to examine its effect on breeding densities of Northern Lapwing Vanellus
   vanellus. Management designed by the farmer involved planting a Brassica
   fodder crop for two consecutive years followed by reseeding with grass,
   with eight out of 17 fields at the farm undergoing this management since
   1997. After controlling for other habitat parameters of importance, the
   density of breeding Lapwings was 52\% higher in fields that had
   undergone fodder crop management than those that had not. Densities were
   highest in the first year after the fodder crop was planted, prior to
   reseeding with grass, but remained above levels in control fields for
   approximately seven years after the fodder crop was last planted. Very
   high Lapwing densities (modelled density = 1 pair ha(-1)) in the year
   after the fodder crop was planted likely result from the heterogeneous
   ground surface created by grazing of the crop providing an
   ``attractive{''} nesting habitat. Continued high densities following
   reseeding with grass may partly be accounted for by philopatry, but the
   fact that they are field-specific also suggests that these fields
   continue to offer enhanced foraging conditions for several years. Fodder
   crop management was implemented at the study site to fatten lambs over
   winter and ultimately improve grass condition for grazing. This system
   is therefore based on active farming and benefits both the farmer and
   breeding Lapwings. As such, it may be possible to implement it more
   widely without the need for high agri-environment payments. More
   generally, it is an example of the land owner being actively involved in
   developing conservation solutions in partnership with environmental
   research, rather than being seen as a passive recipient of knowledge as
   has typically been the case with the design of AES. Such approaches need
   to be adopted more consistently in designing interventions for
   environmental outcomes on farmland, but may be of particular importance
   in the UK if the certainties of European Union AES are to come to an
   end.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical savannas have a ground cover dominated by C-4 grasses, with
   fire and herbivory constraining woody cover below a rainfall-based
   potential. The savanna biome covers 50\% of the African continent,
   encompassing diverse ecosystems that include densely wooded Miombo
   woodlands and Serengeti grasslands with scattered trees. African
   savannas provide water, grazing and browsing, food and fuel for tens of
   millions of people, and have a unique biodiversity that supports
   wildlife tourism. However, human impacts are causing widespread and
   accelerating degradation of savannas. The primary threats are land
   cover-change and transformation, landscape fragmentation that disrupts
   herbivore communities and fire regimes, climate change and rising
   atmospheric CO2. The interactions among these threats are poorly
   understood, with unknown consequences for ecosystem health and human
   livelihoods. We argue that the unique combinations of plant functional
   traits characterizing the major floristic assemblages of African
   savannas make them differentially susceptible and resilient to
   anthropogenic drivers of ecosystem change. Research must address how
   this functional diversity among African savannas differentially
   influences their vulnerability to global change and elucidate the
   mechanisms responsible. This knowledge will permit appropriate
   management strategies to be developed to maintain ecosystem integrity,
   biodiversity and livelihoods.}},

Title = {{Seasonal changes in dry matter yield from Karst pastures as influenced

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Pastures are strongly affected by local environmental variables in terms
   of their species richness, plant composition and herbage production. A
   multi-site monitoring study was conducted over three years to
   investigate the influence of morphoclimatic factors on the seasonal
   variations in dry matter (DM) yield from Karst pastures. Seven sites
   located on the Italian and Slovenian Karst regions were investigated
   that differed in terms of their geological and geomorphological
   features, as well as their soil types. At each site, the daily DM yield
   (kg ha(-1) d(-1)) was determined using Corral-Fenlon method which
   permits to simulate herbage utilization from grazing herds. The
   morphoclimatic features were also analysed, with the aim to evaluate the
   link between seasonal DM yield and geomorphological and environmental
   factors. Generalized non-linear mixed models were built to study the
   observed seasonal variations in DM yield, using day of the year (DOY),
   growing degree days (GDD), and cumulative rainfall. Furthermore,
   environmental descriptors were included in the model in order to
   evaluate their effects on DM yield. The seasonal variations in yield
   showed two growing periods (spring and late summer), which were
   described by Gaussian curves. For the spring growing period, the model
   improved when the interaction between soil granulometry and growing
   degree days corresponding to the curve peak was taken into account. This
   confirms the influence of soil type and air temperature on pasture
   yield. For the late summer growing period, the interaction between the
   sand classes and the number of rainy days from the beginning of the
   period to the peak of the curve improved the model. The curve parameters
   of our models are correlated with environmental descriptors depending on
   the lithology and particle size of soils. The results are essential for
   the optimization of pasture management and avoiding degradation due to
   over- or under-grazing.}},

Title = {{Grazing-induced microbiome alterations drive soil organic carbon
   turnover and productivity in meadow steppe}},
Journal = {{MICROBIOME}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Grazing is a major modulator of biodiversity and
   productivity in grasslands. However, our understanding of
   grazing-induced changes in below-ground communities, processes, and soil
   productivity is limited. Here, using a long-term enclosed grazing meadow
   steppe, we investigated the impacts of grazing on the soil organic
   carbon (SOC) turnover, the microbial community composition, resistance
   and activity under seasonal changes, and the microbial contributions to
   soil productivity.
   Results: The results demonstrated that grazing had significant impacts
   on soil microbial communities and ecosystem functions in meadow steppe.
   The highest microbial a-diversity was observed under light grazing
   intensity, while the highest beta-diversity was observed under moderate
   grazing intensity. Grazing shifted the microbial composition from fungi
   dominated to bacteria dominated and from slow growing to fast growing,
   thereby resulting in a shift from fungi-dominated food webs primarily
   utilizing recalcitrant SOC to bacteria-dominated food webs mainly
   utilizing labile SOC. Moreover, the higher fungal
   recalcitrant-SOC-decomposing activities and bacterial
   labile-SOC-decomposing activities were observed in fungi- and
   bacteria-dominated communities, respectively. Notably, the robustness of
   bacterial community and the stability of bacterial activity were
   associated with a-diversity, while this was not the case for the
   robustness of fungal community and its associated activities. Finally,
   we observed that microbial a diversity rather than SOC turnover rate can
   predict soil productivity.
   Conclusions: Our findings indicate the strong influence of grazing on
   soil microbial community, SOC turnover, and soil productivity and the
   important positive role of soil microbial a-diversity in steering the
   functions of meadow steppe ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Size-dependent loss of aboveground animals differentially affects
   grassland ecosystem coupling and functions}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 11}},
Abstract = {{Increasing evidence suggests that community-level responses to
   human-induced biodiversity loss start with a decrease of interactions
   among communities and between them and their abiotic environment. The
   structural and functional consequences of such interaction losses are
   poorly understood and have rarely been tested in real-world systems.
   Here, we analysed how 5 years of progressive, size-selective exclusion
   of large, medium, and small vertebrates and invertebrates-a realistic
   scenario of human-induced defaunation-impacts the strength of
   relationships between above-and belowground communities and their
   abiotic environment ( hereafter ecosystem coupling) and how this relates
   to ecosystem functionality in grasslands. Exclusion of all vertebrates
   results in the greatest level of ecosystem coupling, while the
   additional loss of invertebrates leads to poorly coupled ecosystems.
   Consumer-driven changes in ecosystem functionality are positively
   related to changes in ecosystem coupling. Our results highlight the
   importance of invertebrate communities for maintaining ecological
   coupling and functioning in an increasingly defaunated world.}},

Journal = {{CASTANEA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The netted pawpaw (Annonaceae, Asimina reticulata) is a widespread
   Florida endemic plant that produces relatively few fruits. To understand
   its distribution and reproductive success, we posed three questions: (a)
   how do time-since-fire (TSF) and pollinator visitation influence
   reproductive success, (b) is it pollinator dependent, and (c) does
   outcrossing increase reproductive success? In 2016, we studied 157
   plants in three flatwoods burn units (last burned, 2015, 2012, or 2001)
   and one grazed pasture at Archbold Biological Station in south-central
   Florida. Plants in pasture and recently burned flatwoods exhibited
   greater flower, fruit, and seed output, suggesting that habitat openness
   may promote competitive release or increased pollinator visitation.
   Pollinator visitation was greatest on plants within the 1-yr TSF, and
   the hairy flower scarab (Trichiotinus viridans) was the most prevalent
   visitor across all sites. Autogamously crossed flowers produced no
   fruit, confirming that seed production is pollinator dependent. Although
   fruit retention (10.0\%) and seed germination (27.8\%) were low after
   geitonogamous crossing, close and far outcrossing increased retention
   (30.8\% and 39.6\%) and germination success (41.6\% and 46.4\%). This
   research suggests that A. reticulata reaches its maximum reproductive
   potential in open areas after outcrossing events, and that low fruit set
   may be due to the lack of an effective pollinator, resulting in
   inbreeding depression. Additionally, an investigation into raccoons
   (Procyon lotor) as fruit consumers and potential seed dispersers
   suggests that seeds may benefit from gut scarification.}},

   case of an alien ungulate in Spain}},
Journal = {{CONSERVATION LETTERS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{Scientific evidence should dominate in any management decision dealing
   with alien species. It is also essential for all stakeholders to agree
   on the terminology used to avoid undesirable misinterpretations. A
   well-known example is the use of the term invasive, which has two basic
   meanings, one as a biogeographic criterion and the other as an impact
   criterion. The aoudad (Ammotragus lervia) is a North African ungulate
   introduced in Spain, which was labeled invasive by Spanish authorities
   due to misreading of the term used by early studies. Indeed, to date,
   there are no conclusive empirical data showing negative effects of the
   aoudad on native flora and fauna. Recent studies have shown that its
   closest native ungulate, the Iberian ibex (Capra pyrenaica), has
   expanded throughout territories already occupied by the aoudad, without
   any apparent conflict. Aoudad diet selection studies also show them to
   be markedly grazers, so its role in the Mediterranean trophic network
   might be similar to that of extinct wild ungulates that fed in natural
   meadows, maintaining landscapes heterogeneous. New opportunities for its
   study are opening, particularly in Iberian semiarid lands. Unfortunately
   though, its current simplistic definition as an invasive species keeps
   in suspense its eventual eradication throughout the country.}},

Title = {{No evidence for trade-offs in plant responses to consumer food web
   manipulations}},

Abstract = {{Plants face a range of trade-offs as they attempt to maximize their
   fitness within a complex web composed of competitors, mutualists, and
   herbivores. In addition to growth-defense and competition-defense
   trade-offs, plants must balance their response to a wide range of
   potential enemies including pathogens and vertebrate and invertebrate
   herbivores. We tested for trade-offs in plant species' responses to
   different types of consumers using a foodweb manipulation experiment in
   which we selectively excluded large vertebrate herbivores and removed
   foliar fungi, soil fungi, and insects from natural and experimentally
   planted grassland communities. We found no evidence for trade-offs in
   the ability of plants to defend themselves against different sets of
   consumers, although plants varied widely in their responses to removal
   of different consumer groups. In addition, the species-level responses
   to consumer removal in monoculture were uncorrelated with each species'
   response in more diverse communities, highlighting the important role of
   local context (e.g., competition and apparent competition) in
   determining the effects of consumers. Plants must balance their
   allocation of energy among a wide variety of tasks including growing,
   competing for limited resources, and defending themselves against an
   array of potential enemies. We found that while plant species differed
   greatly in their response to the removal of consumers, species that were
   susceptible to the effects of one consumer group (e.g., insect
   herbivores) also were susceptible to other consumer groups (e.g., fungal
   pathogens). This suggests that plants differ in their overall allocation
   to defense, but defense investment can proffer protection against a wide
   array of natural enemies. We also found that plant responses to
   consumers depended on the diversity of the surrounding plant community,
   suggesting that among-plant interactions can alter their susceptibility
   to the impacts of consumers.}},

Title = {{Spatial heterogeneity in species composition constrains plant community

Abstract = {{Environmental change can result in substantial shifts in community
   composition. The associated immigration and extinction events are likely
   constrained by the spatial distribution of species. Still, studies on
   environmental change typically quantify biotic responses at single
   spatial (time series within a single plot) or temporal (spatial beta
   diversity at single time points) scales, ignoring their potential
   interdependence. Here, we use data from a global network of grassland
   experiments to determine how turnover responses to two major forms of
   environmental change - fertilisation and herbivore loss - are affected
   by species pool size and spatial compositional heterogeneity.
   Fertilisation led to higher rates of local extinction, whereas turnover
   in herbivore exclusion plots was driven by species replacement. Overall,
   sites with more spatially heterogeneous composition showed significantly
   higher rates of annual turnover, independent of species pool size and
   treatment. Taking into account spatial biodiversity aspects will
   therefore improve our understanding of consequences of global and
   anthropogenic change on community dynamics.}},

Title = {{Enhancement of a declining European ground squirrel (Spermophilus

Journal = {{JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{98-106}},

Abstract = {{The European ground squirrel is a vulnerable species in Europe, and a
   critically endangered species in the northwestern part of its range. In
   Hungary, although there are several robust populations on a European
   scale, we are also witnessing a process of decline. Local individual
   numbers of the focal species decreased quickly until 2011, caused by the
   drastic reduction in the grazing and mowing of its habitat. In response
   to the decline of the focal species' population, a habitat restoration
   project was started in 2012 in order to stop and reverse this process.
   We studied the interventions for habitat restoration (elimination of
   scrubs and Elaeagnus angustifolia trees, grazing and mechanical mowing)
   between 2012 and 2015. In the monitoring program the number of European
   ground squirrel specimens was estimated by the quadrat-method and a
   small-scale transect survey. Potentially the most effective parameters
   of vegetation, soil and macroclimate were used as predictor variables.
   The results of our monitoring study showed that the most significant
   factors in the differences in the individual numbers were the height of
   the vegetation, and the depth and percentage of the sand and silt
   fractions of the soil. The density of Spermophilus citellus was
   positively affected by the cover of xeric grasses and therophyta plant
   species, soil depth, the percentage of sand and silt fractions of the
   soil, and was negatively affected by height of vegetation, cover of
   scrub, tall-herb plant species, and the percentage of the gravel
   fraction of the soil. Accordingly, the soil conditions of the target
   areas should be assessed in advance in order to achieve success in
   supplying the European ground squirrel population. This could help in
   the successful planning of interventions and relocation attempts in
   order to repatriate European ground squirrel populations.}},

Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1819-1828}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{1. Plant diversity is impacted by multiple global change drivers but
   also by altered biotic interactions with antagonist arid mutualist
   organisms that can potentially affect species coexistence.
   2. With a 2-year, outdoor mesocosm experiment in realistic mesic
   grassland communities, we explored the role of insect herbivory in
   impacting plant community dynamics under contrasting levels of water
   availability simulating altered rainfall regimes. We selected a
   grasshopper species (Calliptamus italicus L.) feeding predominantly on
   forbs while avoiding grasses.
   3. High water availability reduced species coexistence, boosting
   productivity while decreasing individual plant survival. At the
   community level, herbivores were not able to promote species coexistence
   but asymmetrically influenced grasses and forbs, reducing forb biomass
   under high water availability.
   4. Herbivores shaped individual plant responses to both abiotic
   conditions and individual-neighbours' interactions. Herbivores
   influenced focal plant survival by altering the effect of neighbouring
   plants, mitigating the negative effect of high neighbour biomass at low
   water availability and exacerbating it at high level of water
   availability.
   5. Synthesis. Altered rainfall has the capacity to change the relative
   strength of plant-plant interactions and also to determine the effects
   of herbivores on grassland communities. The complexity of the
   interactions between plants and herbivores and the observed context
   dependence indicate the need to incorporate multiple biotic and abiotic
   drivers to fully understand the mechanisms underlying plant dynamics and
   species coexistence in a changing world.}},

Title = {{Effects of indirect facilitation on functional diversity, dominance and
   niche differentiation in tropical alpine communities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{835-846}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Question
   Positive interactions between plants have well-known effects on
   community species richness and biomass via micro-environment
   improvements. However, the effects of indirect facilitation performed by
   a nurse on an associated plant community, occurring e.g., through
   protection against grazing, have not attracted much attention in the
   literature so far, in particular regarding the functional traits of the
   associated plant communities. Because characteristics of trait
   distributions can reveal selective pressures at play, they offer
   valuable information for the study of grazing pressure. Here, we tested
   the extent to which indirect facilitation affects the amount of distinct
   trait combinations (H1), trait dominance (H2) and niche differentiation
   between species (H3) of associated plant communities living under nurse
   plants.
   LocationMethodsTropical alpine peatlands, Cordillera Real, Bolivia.
   We set up a grazing exclusion experiment over two dominant nurse cushion
   species: one providing indirect facilitation under grazing pressure and
   the other not. We measured three functional traits in the associated
   communities, which are known to vary depending on the grazing level:
   LDMC, leaf thickness and maximum height. We assessed the amount of
   distinct trait combinations by computing the volume of the phenotypic
   space (H1). The variation in trait dominance was quantified with
   kurtosis and skewness of the trait distributions (H2). The variation in
   niche differentiation was evaluated using mean intra-population trait
   variance relative to intra-community trait variance (H3).
   ResultsConclusionWe did not find a significant effect of grazing and
   indirect facilitation on the volume of the phenotypic space (H1).
   However, our study revealed a significant effect of indirect
   facilitation on dominance in the associated communities by maintaining
   the evenness of the trait distributions (maximum height and leaf
   thickness) in grazed compared to ungrazed plots (H2), and on niche
   differentiation by maintaining trait overlaps (LDMC and maximum height)
   between species in grazed compared to ungrazed contexts (H3).
   Our results suggest that indirect facilitation promotes the co-existence
   of contrasting functional strategies (H2) and species niches (H3) in
   associated plant communities subject to grazing. These results reflect
   the buffering effect of indirect facilitation on the grazing selective
   pressures exerted on associated plant communities living under the
   protection of nurses.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the impact of grazing on vegetation structure, and thus on
   ecosystem services, is one of the main technical bottlenecks in alpine
   grassland conservation and management. However, past researches based on
   the fixed, discrete, and qualitative indicators limited our
   understanding for the effect of grazing on plant community assembly.
   Research based on the quantitative competitor, stress tolerator, and
   ruderal (CSR) theory increases the possibilities for analyzing this
   ecological process. To test the hypothesis that the dominant plant
   strategy in alpine meadow plant community will shift from S-selection to
   R-selection with increased grazing intensity, the plant community CSR
   strategy assemblies among the cold-seasonal grazing meadows along a
   gradient of grazing intensity were studied on the eastern Tibetan
   Plateau. The dominant strategy concentrated in the S-selected corner
   under the low grazing intensity, which provided a direct evidence to the
   environmental filters in the alpine area, and suggested that species of
   strong S-selection should dominate the undisturbed alpine grassland
   plant community. The C-selection of dominant strategies increased (R-2 =
   0.431, p = 0.004), and the extent of S-selection decreased with greater
   grazing intensity; however, the R-selection of them only slightly
   increased under intermediate grazing intensity and finally decreased
   under high grazing intensity, reflecting a selective grazing disturbance
   combined with localized enrichment of soil that can provide microsites
   for the establishment of competitors. The strong C-selected species may
   dominate the plant community on the eastern Tibetan Plateau in place of
   S-selected and R-selected species, if the grazing intensity is
   continually high.}},

Abstract = {{Seagrass beds provide habitat for a wide array of organisms. Among
   these, macrobenthos constitute a major group in seagrass bed
   communities. The effects of seagrass meadows on macrobenthic community
   structure have been studied in many areas, and have revealed
   contradictory results regarding the meadow's effects. In this study,
   sediment environment and macrobenthic community structure and diversity
   were investigated in an eelgrass bed and an adjacent unvegetated area in
   Swan Lake, northern China, from November 2011 to October 2012. Sediment
   grain size and organic matter did not differ significantly between the
   two areas. Polychaeta were the most abundant taxon, and herbivores,
   detritivores, and deposit feeders were the main functional feeding
   groups. Carnivores were slightly more abundant in the eelgrass bed than
   in the unvegetated area. Permutational multivariate analysis of variance
   (PERMANOVA) indicated that the macrobenthic assemblage differed between
   the two habitats, but analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) did not validate
   this result. Analysis of similarity percentages (SIMPER) demonstrated
   that Polychaeta was the largest contributor to dissimilarity between the
   macrobenthic assemblages; however, diversity was similar throughout the
   year, and theoretical species richness was equivalent (80 species)
   between the two areas. Thus, the presence of eelgrass did not affect
   macrobenthic community structure or diversity in the Swan Lake
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Biological diversities of multiple kingdoms potentially respond in
   similar ways to environmental changes. However, studies either compare
   details of microbial diversity across general vegetation or land use
   classes or relate details of plant community diversity with the extent
   of microbially governed soil processes, via physiological profiling.
   Here, we test the hypothesis of shared responses of plant and
   rhizosphere bacterial, fungal and metazoan biodiversities (especially
   across-habitat beta-diversity patterns) along a disturbance gradient
   encompassing grazed to abandoned Alpine pasture, on acid soil in the
   European Central Alps. Rhizosphere biological diversity was inferred
   from eDNA fractions specific to bacteria, fungi and metazoans from
   contrasting plant habitats indicative of different disturbance levels.
   We found that soil beta-diversity patterns were weakly correlated with
   plant diversity measures and similarly ordinated along an evident
   edaphic (pH, C:N, assimilable P) and disturbance gradient but, contrary
   to our hypothesis, did not demonstrate the same diversity patterns.
   While plant communities were well separated along the disturbance
   gradient, correlating with fungal diversity, the majority of bacterial
   taxa were shared between disturbance levels (75\% of bacteria were
   ubiquitous, cf. 29\% plant species). Metazoa exhibited an intermediate
   response, with communities at the lowest levels of disturbance partially
   overlapping. Thus, plant and soil biological diversities were only
   loosely dependent and did not exhibit strictly linked environmental
   responses. This probably reflects the different spatial scales of
   organisms (and their habitats) and capacity to invest resources in
   persistent multicellular tissues, suggesting that vegetation responses
   to environmental change are unreliable indicators of below-ground
   biodiversity responses.}},

Abstract = {{The wood pastures or hardwood rangelands of the southwestern Iberian
   Peninsula are complex social-ecological systems created from the
   long-term interaction of society and the landscape. Dehesa, oak
   woodlands managed for grazing, cropping, and other forms of production,
   is the most common rangeland system and one of the most distinctive
   landscapes. Traditionally characterized by multifunctional low-intensity
   management that enhances a wide range of ecosystem services, current
   management has shifted from the traditional toward more intensified
   models. This paper assesses the coproduction of ecosystem services on
   dehesa properties by exploring the relationship between biophysical and
   sociocultural factors and dehesa management practices. Based on 42
   surveys we analyze 16 quantitative indicators using multivariate
   techniques. The results indicate that there are four main dehesa types
   as defined by their characteristics and management: large heterogeneous
   operations with diverse products; small and homogeneous operations
   focused on a reduced number of products; medium-large properties focused
   on crop production; and midsized properties with easy public access.
   Management is the result of the dynamics of interacting biophysical and
   sociocultural factors that influence manager priorities and investment.
   Management decisions group around the degree of multifunctionality of
   the operation, the relative importance of crop production, the degree of
   grazing pressure in the system, and how restrictive public access policy
   is. We find that in the study area interactions between all the
   previously mentioned elements covary consistently. generating bundles of
   ecosystem services associated with each of three management models based

Abstract = {{In spite of being the highest in the Northern Hemisphere (up to 4900 m),
   treelines in Himalayas are among the least investigated systems. This
   paper (i) sheds light on treeline distribution along Himalayan Arc; (ii)
   discusses factors affecting treeline elevation in a warming world; (iii)
   reports initial findings of a multi-site and multi-partner research
   project on Himalayan treelines; and (iv) analyses future research needs.
   The Himalayan treeline elevation increases from the north-west to
   south-east along the Arc, and is higher on south aspect than north
   aspect and in inner ranges than outer ranges. Apart from heat
   deficiency, several factors such as mass elevation effect and height of
   the nearest mountains and changes in grazing pressure influence treeline
   elevation in Himalayas. The principal treeline ecotone genera are
   Betula, Abies, Rhododendron and Juniperus. The treeline maps developed
   with remote sensing techniques at a regional level show that the
   elevations of the nearest mountain summit influence treeline elevations
   to an extent. Temperature Lapse Rate (similar to 0.53 degrees C/100 m)
   estimated from observed data, is found lower than generally used in
   literature, and differs seasonally and across aspects. Our tree water
   relation study suggests that water is not a limiting factor in treeline
   ecotone, however, data on tree ring width chronology emphasize the
   significance of pre-monsoon drought in treeline dynamics. Tree species
   richness increases from west to east, but the same way not apply to
   other growth forms. Rhododendron campanulatum seems to move up rapidly,
   and thus, has potential to influence the ecology of alpine meadows.
   Treeline and livelihood issues need to be managed to conserve treeline
   ecotones. Long term treeline studies are required to make
   generalizations in the context of climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The present study provides a socio-ecological assessment of the
   timberline zone falling in Tawang and West Kameng districts of Arunachal
   Pradesh, the easternmost state of India. Satellite imageries were used
   to stratify land use-cover, slope, and aspects, vegetation types, along
   with ground-truthing of floristic diversity and forest structure. The
   region comprised >70\% of the total geographical area under forest (82\%
   under dense cover) divisible into eight forest types. The timberline
   takes a zig-zag course between 3600 and 4600 m. A reconnaissance of
   vegetation and species richness revealed that the tree and shrub
   richness peaked in lower one-third of the elevation gradient, whereafter
   declined sharply with the rise in elevation. In timberline area there
   were only 5 tree and 11 shrub species. The timberline area, however,
   comprised 152 plant species, which is significant. A comparison of
   timberline across Himalayan states reveals that the upper timberline
   limit increases from northwest to northeast. In Arunachal Pradesh
   timberlines are dominated by A. densa, which is associated with several
   species of Rhododendron and Sorb us species. In recent times the
   timberline ecotone has been subjected to increased developmental
   activists, such as road construction and fulfilling diverse community
   needs, viz. timber, firewood, medicinal herbs, grazing grounds.
   Management of grazing areas, which used to be done by traditional
   village institutions that maintained the quality of pastures, has been
   gradually losing its effectiveness. The study emphasized the need for
   more coordinated researches to develop a better understanding of the
   timberline area in near future.}},

Abstract = {{In Switzerland, biodiversity promotion areas or BPAs (i.e. land under
   Swiss agri-environment schemes) account for around 15 \% of the utilised
   agricultural area. While the main objective of BPAs is to promote
   farmland biodiversity, their effectiveness remains limited, in
   particular as regards the incidence of invertebrates in the lowlands. In
   this study, the mowing regime of lowland BPA hay meadows was manipulated
   to measure the impact on biodiversity. Results show that the abundance
   of invertebrates increases, - sometimes massively - when the first
   mowing date is delayed by one month (i.e. from mid-June to mid-July)
   and/or when a refuge is left uncut at each mowing event on 10 to 20\% of
   the meadow area. In addition, both of these alternative mowing regimes
   also increase the species richness of some invertebrate taxa. As regards
   vegetation, there was no sign of change after five years. These findings
   demonstrate both the short-term (i.e. over a season) and long-term
   (cumulative, i.e. from one year to the next) beneficial role of delaying
   mowing and leaving uncut refuges for the sake of biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{High impact grazing (HIG) was proposed as a management option to reduce
   standing dead biomass in Northern Argentinean (Chaco) rangelands.
   However, the effects of HIG on grassland diversity and shifts in plant
   functional groups are largely unknown but essential to assess the
   sustainability of the impact. During a two-year grazing experiment, HIG
   was applied every month to analyze the seasonal effects on plant species
   composition and plant functional groups. The results indicate that
   irrespective of the season in which HIG was applied, the diversity
   parameters were not negatively affected. Species richness, the
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index and the Shannon's equitability index did
   not differ from the control site within a 12-month period after HIG.
   While plant functional groups of dicotyledonous and annual species could
   not benefit from the HIG disturbance, C-3-, C-4-monocotyledonous and
   perennials increased their absolute and relative green cover. Our
   results suggest that HIG, if not applied in shorter frequencies than a
   year, neither alters diversity nor shifts the plant species composition
   of the grassland plant community, but instead it promotes previously
   established rather competitive species. HIG could therefore contribute
   as an alternative management practice to the sustainable land use
   intensification of the Gran Chaco grassland ecosystem and even
   counteract the encroachment of low value species.}},

Abstract = {{Rangelands with scattered trees are complex and dynamic systems with a
   long history in Europe. Generally referred to as ``wood-pastures,{''}
   they are considered to have outstanding conservation value. Thorny
   shrubs are important for supporting the biodiversity of these wooded
   rangelands, as well as facilitating the regeneration of trees by acting
   as nurse species. We assess the direct effects of temporary shrub
   encroachment under the cover of mature sparse trees on overall plant and
   habitat diversity. We surveyed the herb layer of the main landscape
   features of a wood-pasture: open pasture, trees with a grass understory,
   trees with shrubs, and adjacent forest edges. The herb layer under trees
   with shrubs resembled that of forest edges more than open pastures and
   trees with grass. Trees with grass had a higher cover of ruderal species
   than trees with shrubs, while forest edges and open pastures had a lower
   cover of them. Forest species were absent from open pastures but were
   well represented in the other sites. The herb layer of trees with shrubs
   and forest edges had similar cover values, while trees with grass had a
   significantly lower cover of herbs than the other types. Trees with
   shrubs had higher species richness than any of the other three landscape
   features and had a much higher proportion of diagnostic species. We
   conclude that the scattered trees and shrubs of the studied
   silvopastoral system have additive facilitative effects on their
   understory, probably through modifying the microenvironment and grazing
   pressure, leading to the formation of temporary diversity hot spots with
   distinct vegetation. Thus maintaining a moderate level of
   shrub-encroachment under sparse trees is recommended for not only
   creating safe havens for tree recruitment but also increasing the
   overall species and habitat diversity of wood-pastures. (C) 2017 The

Abstract = {{Due to their complex structure and traditional low-intensity management,
   Portuguese oak woodland rangelands known as montados are often
   considered high nature value (HNV) farming systems, and as such, they
   may be deemed eligible for subsidies and incentives by governmental and
   nongovernmental agencies. Too little is known about how the HNV concept
   might be applied to conserve complex silvopastoral systems. These
   systems, due to their structural and functional complexity at multiple
   scales, tend to support high levels of biodiversity. Montados are in
   sharp decline as a result of the rapid specialization of land management
   that, through simplification, undermines multifunctionality.
   Understanding how changes in management influence these systems and
   their biodiversity is needed for prioritizing conservation efforts and
   for ensuring they remain HNV systems. On the basis of a field survey in
   58 plots distributed among 29 paddocks on 17 farms, we conducted an
   integrated analysis of the relationship between grazing intensity and
   biodiversity in montados of similar biophysical and structural
   characteristics. Data on management were obtained through interviews,
   and biodiversity data (vegetation, macrofungi, birds, herpetofauna) were
   obtained through specific field protocols. Additional spatial data, such
   as soil characteristics, slope, land cover, and linear landscape
   elements, were also analyzed. The results show no overall biodiversity
   variation as a result of different management practices. However,
   different groups of species react differently to specific management
   practices, and within a pasture, grazing impacts are heterogenous. In
   low grazing intensity plots, macrofungi species richness was found to be
   higher, while bird species richness was lower. Using tree regeneration
   as proxy for montado sustainability, results show less tree regeneration
   in areas with higher forage quality and more intense grazing. Pathways
   for future progress are proposed, including creating areas within a
   paddock that attract grazing away from where regeneration is desired.

Abstract = {{Grasslands are globally extensive; they exist in many different
   climates, at high and low elevations, on nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor
   soils. Grassland distributions today are closely linked to human
   activities, herbivores, and fire, but many have been converted to urban
   areas, forests, or agriculture fields. Roughly 80\% of fires globally
   occur in grasslands each year, making fire a critical process in
   grassland dynamics. Yet, little is known about the long-term history of
   fire in grasslands. Here, we analyze sedimentary archives to reconstruct
   grassland fire histories during the Holocene. Given that grassland
   locations change over time, we compare several charcoal-based fire
   reconstructions based on alternative classification schemes: (a) sites
   from modern grassland locations; (b) sites that were likely grasslands
   during the mid-Holocene; and (c) sites based on author-derived
   classifications. We also compare fire histories from grassland sites,
   forested sites, and all sites globally over the past 12,000years.
   Forested versus grassland sites show different trends: grassland burning
   increased from the early to mid-Holocene, reaching a maximum about
   8000-6000years ago, and subsequently declined, reaching a minimum around
   4000years ago. In contrast, biomass burning in forests increased during
   the Holocene until about 2000years ago. Continental grassland fire
   history reconstructions show opposing Holocene trends in North versus
   South America, whereas grassland burning in Australia was highly
   variable in the early Holocene and much more stable after the
   mid-Holocene. The sharp differences in continental as well as forest
   versus grassland Holocene fire history trajectories have important
   implications for our understanding of global biomass burning and its
   emissions, the global carbon cycle, biodiversity, conservation, and land
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Golf courses can be characterized as plant communities with a simplified

   assessing the effectiveness of different cultural practices to increase
   biodiversity. Two sites dominated by either Elytrigia repens (L.) Nevski

   Three management practices were randomly assigned to plots within each
   site in May 2013: (i) mowing followed by biomass removal and
   verticutting, and subsequent supply of hay to provide seeds of local
   species; (ii) mowing followed by biomass removal and verticutting; and
   (iii) areas left unmowed (control). Cultural practices had a significant
   effect on biodiversity in the short-term. The number of plant species at
   Site 1 was higher in plots receiving Management Practices A and B, and
   at Site 2 in plots receiving Management Practice A. In contrast,
   management practice had no effect on the percentages of dominant
   species. The principal component analysis (PCA) indicated a shift in
   botanical composition in plots receiving treatments A and B in the
   second year, while in the last year of the study, the botanical
   composition of all plots returned to its original state. A single cut in
   spring was not sufficient to counteract the dominance of highly
   competitive species.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purpose: The impact of invasive species in ecosystems is
   an important problem worldwide and the spreading of invader species are
   affected exceedingly by linear infrastructure. Primarily the aim of our
   investigation was to studied how the invasion of the species impacts the
   isopod diversity of roadside verges. Secondly, we determined what
   attributes of linear infrastructure affect on mass occurrence by the
   species.
   Materials and methods: Double-glass pitfall traps were established 30
   localities along highways and 4 localities along main roads in Hungary
   between 2011 and 2016. To studied what attributes of roads affect the
   abundance of A. vulgare we considered seasons, adjacent areas, road edge
   proximity, leaf-litter depth, the age of highway, vegetation type and
   mowing.
   Results: We collected a total of 18 isopod species. The A. vulgare was
   the most abundant and frequently encountered species in both road types,
   which represented 89\% of the total isopod catches. The high abundance
   of the species negatively correlated with isopod diversity. The invasive
   nature of this species is promoted by summer season, the proximity of
   arable fields, intermediate distance from the road, leaf-litter at a
   depth of 0 cm and the young age of highways. On mainroad verges the
   highest abundance was in the non-mown sections of the arid grassland
   sites.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that this species is likely to
   adversely impact ecosystem function of roadside verges in Hungary.
   Different land use, water supply, surrounding landscapes, habitat
   structure, vegetation, biogeographical context and human activities
   along road verges influence the invasiveness of A. vulgare.}},

Abstract = {{1. Accounting for 10\%-30\% of global soil organic carbon, grassland
   soils potentially present a large reservoir for storing atmospheric CO2.
   Livestock grazing management can substantially affect grassland soil
   carbon (C) storage, but few controlled experiments have explored how
   herbivore assemblages (different herbivore species and combinations)
   affect soil C storage.
   2. We examined effects of moderate grazing by different herbivore
   assemblages (no grazing; sheep grazing; cattle grazing; mixed grazing by
   sheep and cattle) on soil organic carbon storage in two types of
   grassland communities (high forbs/high diversity and low forbs/low
   diversity), within a semi-arid grassland with a 5-year grazing history.
   3. We found that herbivore assemblage generated varying effects on soil
   C storage and the effects were subject to grassland community types. In
   the low diversity community, none of three herbivore assemblages studied
   had obvious effects on soil C storage. In the high diversity community,
   however, sheep grazing significantly decreased soil C storage due to
   high selectivity for high quality forbs, and cattle grazing had no
   effects on soil C storage, while mixed grazing by sheep and cattle
   significantly increased soil C storage. Overall, soil C storage was
   highest in mixed-grazed grassland sites with high diversity.}},

Title = {{The role of spider hunting mode on the strength of spider-plant
   mutualisms}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{188}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{213-222}},

Abstract = {{The strength and outcome of mutualistic interactions can be highly
   dependent on the combination of traits of the species involved. Distinct
   foraging strategies (e.g., hunting mode) of mutualistic predators may
   cause predator-prey interactions to vary, potentially affecting the
   strength of trophic cascades. We evaluate the causes of variation in the
   strength of spider-plant mutualisms by focusing on contrasting hunting
   modes of two spiders: an actively hunting lynx spider (Peucetia sp.) and
   a sit-and-wait crab spider (Misumenops argenteus). We manipulated spider
   species composition by assigning each plant to one of the following
   treatments: (1) no spiders; (2) sit-and-wait spiders only; (3) actively
   hunting spiders only; (4) actively hunting + sit-and-wait spiders. We
   then examined the independent and interactive effects of spider species
   on floral herbivory and fitness of the glandular trichome-bearing plant,
   Trichogoniopsis adenantha (Asteraceae). Both spider species increased
   plant fitness by suppressing herbivores and increasing ovary
   fertilization, but the overall net benefit of spiders was contingent on
   spider hunting mode. Sit-and-wait spiders promoted stronger positive
   cascading effects compared to actively hunting spiders. The combination
   of spider species suppressed herbivores in an additive manner; their
   combined impact on plant fitness, however, was lower than expected,
   suggesting that the inter-specific interaction between spiders is
   slightly antagonistic. Thus, both spider species combined weakened the
   strength of this spider-plant mutualism. Our findings offer a general
   framework for understanding the critical role of predator foraging mode
   in trophic cascades.}},

Title = {{Experimental herbivore exclusion, shrub introduction, and carbon
   sequestration in alpine plant communities}},
Journal = {{BMC ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Shrub cover in arctic and alpine ecosystems has increased in
   recent decades, and is predicted to further increase with climate
   change. Changes in shrub abundance may alter ecosystem carbon (C)
   sequestration and storage, with potential positive feedback on global C
   cycling. Small and large herbivores may reduce shrub expansion and
   thereby counteract the positive feedback on C cycling, but herbivore
   pressures have also changed in the alpine-arctic tundra; the increased
   shrub cover together with changes in herbivore pressure is leading to
   unpredictable changes in carbon sequestration and storage. In this study
   we investigate the importance of herbivory and shrub introduction for
   carbon sequestration in the short term. We measured standing biomass and
   daytime mid-growing season carbon fluxes in plots in a full factorial
   design where we excluded small and large mammalian herbivores and
   introduced Salix by planting Salix transplants. We used three study
   sites: one Empetrum-dominated heath, one herb-and cryptogam-dominated
   meadow, and one 5 . a/ix-dominated shrub community in the low-alpine
   zone of the Dovre Mountains, Central Norway.
   Results: After 2 years, significant treatment effects were recorded in
   the heath community, but not in the meadow and shrub communities. In the
   heath community cessation of herbivory increased standing biomass due to
   increased biomass of dwarf shrubs. Cessation of herbivory also reduced
   biomass of bryophytes and ecosystem respiration (ER). Except for an
   increase in biomass of deciduous shrubs caused by the Salix
   introduction, the only effect of Salix introduction was an increase in
   biomass of graminoids in the heath.
   Conclusions: Our short-term study demonstrated that herbivore exclusion
   had small but still significant effects on heath vegetation, whereas
   such effects were not apparent in the herb-and cryptogam-dominated
   meadow and the Salix-dominated shrub community. Following the treatments
   over more years is needed to estimate the long-term effects on community
   structure and the consequences for C sequestration in the three plant
   communities. Such data are important for predicting the impact of shrub
   expansion on C budgets from alpine regions.}},

Abstract = {{Elevational richness patterns and underlying environmental correlates
   have contributed greatly to a range of general theories of biodiversity.
   However, the mechanisms underlying elevational abundance and biomass
   patterns across several trophic levels in belowground food webs remain
   largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to disentangle the
   relationships between the elevational patterns of different trophic
   levels of litter invertebrates and their underlying environmental
   correlates for two contrasting ecosystems separated by the treeline. We
   sampled 119 plots from 1020 to 1770 asl in forest and 21 plots from 1790
   to 2280 asl in meadow on Dongling Mountain, northwest of Beijing, China.
   Four functional guilds were divided based on feeding regime: omnivores,
   herbivores, predators, and detritivores. We used eigenvector-based
   spatial filters to account for spatial autocorrelation and multi-model
   selection to determine the best environmental correlates for the
   community attributes of the different feeding guilds. The results showed
   that the richness, abundance and biomass of omnivores declined with
   increasing elevation in the meadow, whereas there was a hump-shaped
   richness pattern for detritivores. The richness and abundance of
   different feeding guilds were positively correlated in the forest, while
   not in the meadow. In the forest, the variances of richness in
   omnivores, predators, and detritivores were mostly correlated with
   litter thickness, with omnivores being best explained by mean annual
   temperature in the meadow. In conclusion, hump-shaped elevational
   richness, abundance and biomass patterns driven by the forest gradient
   below the treeline existed in all feeding guilds of litter
   invertebrates. Climate replaced productivity as the primary factor that
   drove the richness patterns of omnivores above the treeline, whereas
   heterogeneity replaced climate for herbivores. Our results highlight
   that the correlated elevational richness, abundance, and biomass
   patterns of feeding guilds are ecosystem-dependent and that the
   underlying environmental correlates shifted at the treeline for most
   feeding guilds. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Who will win where and why? An ecophysiological dissection of the
   competition between a tropical pasture grass and the invasive weed

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{In tropical agriculture, the vigorously growing Bracken fern causes
   severe problems by invading pastures and out-competing the common
   pasture grasses. Due to infestation by that weed, pastures are abandoned
   after a few years, and as a fatal consequence, the biodiversity-rich
   tropical forest is progressively cleared for new grazing areas. Here we
   present a broad physiological comparison of the two plant species that
   are the main competitors on the pastures in the tropical Ecuadorian
   Andes, the planted forage grass Setaria sphacelata and the weed Bracken
   (Pteridium arachnoideum). With increasing elevation, the competitive
   power of Bracken increases as shown by satellite data of the study
   region. Using data obtained from field measurements, the annual biomass
   production of both plant species, as a measure of their competitive
   strength, was modeled over an elevational gradient from 1800 to 2800 m.
   The model shows that with increasing elevation, biomass production of
   the two species shifts in favor of Bracken which, above 1800 m, is
   capable of outgrowing the grass. In greenhouse experiments, the effects
   on plant growth of the presumed key variables of the elevational
   gradient, temperature and UV radiation, were separately analyzed. Low
   temperature, as well as UV irradiation, inhibited carbon uptake of the
   C4-grass more than that of the C3-plant Bracken. The less
   temperature-sensitive photosynthesis of Bracken and its effective
   protection from UV radiation contribute to the success of the weed on
   the highland pastures. In field samples of Bracken but not of Setaria,
   the content of flavonoids as UV-scavengers increased with the elevation.
   Combining modeling with measurements in greenhouse and field allowed to
   explain the invasive growth of a common weed in upland pastures. The
   performance of Setaria decreases with elevation due to suboptimal
   photosynthesis at lower temperatures and the inability to adapt its
   cellular UV screen.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean wooded grasslands that emerge from silvopastoral
   activities are multifunctional systems that result in high biodiversity
   and offer ecosystem services such as forage production and soil carbon
   sequestration. During 3 years, ten grazed wooded grassland fields were
   studied in the Berchidda-Monti long-term observatory, located in NE
   Sardinia, Italy, with the aim of exploring the synergies and trade-offs
   between biodiversity and selected ecosystem services. Positions below
   and outside the canopy of three cork oak trees in each field were
   randomly selected to compare seasonal pasture production, pasture
   utilization rate by animals, botanical composition, biodiversity
   indicators (Shannon index and plant species richness) and soil organic
   carbon. In autumn, dry matter production of pasture was similar in the
   two positions; in two winters out of three it was greater below the
   trees than outside, and in spring it was greater outside than below the
   trees. While plant species richness and Shannon index were not
   significantly influenced by the position, the overall wooded grassland
   plant species richness was 31\% higher than that outside of the tree
   crown. The soil organic carbon content in the 0-40-cm soil layer was
   also higher below the trees. Our findings highlight that if the main
   purpose of the wooded grasslands is to provide forage for grazing
   animals rather than conserving and/or enhancing plant diversity and soil
   fertility, the presence of trees constrains the overall forage
   productivity, although the greater forage availability in winter under
   the trees can contribute to improve the seasonal distribution of forage
   production.}},

Abstract = {{Colonial encounters with tropical ecosystems were primarily driven by
   profit-oriented management practices; witness the extensive network of
   timber and forestry practices that were set up across colonial India. In
   contrast, the colonial engagement with the montane forest-grassland
   mosaics of the higher reaches of the Western Ghats in southern India was
   marked by intensive investment in vegetation management by colonial
   foresters that yielded no profits. In this archival study, we trace the
   history of extensive vegetation transformation in this landscape from
   the early nineteenth to the early twentieth century. We show how the
   misperception that the grasslands within this mosaic must have resulted
   from tree felling, fire-setting and buffalo grazing by indigenous
   communities led colonial foresters into a century-long effort at
   `foresting' the grasslands, primarily through large-scale planting of
   exotic tree species. These efforts persisted despite economic losses and
   ecological evidence that native tree seedlings planted in the grasslands
   repeatedly failed to establish. These policies continued unabated into
   the late twentieth century in newly independent India. Today, the once
   picturesque landscapes of these ancient forest-grassland mosaics are
   diminished by large-scale plantations of exotic species. Some of these
   species have become invasive and pose significant threats to the remnant
   natural grasslands. While this historical narrative is set in the
   forest-grassland mosaics of southern India, it finds striking parallels
   in the current day, with grasslands and savannas globally threatened by
   the misperception that they are `degraded ecosystems' that can be
   `forested' or converted to other `productive' land uses. We suggest that
   this case history portends the potential fates of many of earth's
   threatened tropical grasslands and savannas.}},

Abstract = {{Ongoing climate change, as well as long-term overgrazing, is threatening
   biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in grasslands worldwide. Climate
   change and grazing could directly alter ecosystem functioning and
   stability, or indirectly by changing species diversity, composition and
   plant functional traits. By synthesizing results from publications of
   the most recent 30-years, we found that effects of climate change and
   grazing on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning varied from positive
   to negative, depending on different scenarios. Generally, aboveground
   net primary production (ANPP), belowground net primary production
   (BNPP), and species richness showed strong negative responses to 4
   degrees C warming, 50\% precipitation decrease, and high grazing
   intensity. Responses of ANPP, BNPP and species richness to precipitation
   increase were mostly positive, whereas their responses to 2 degrees C
   warming and low-to-moderate grazing intensity varied from positive to
   negative. Negative effects of 2 degrees C warming on ANPP were
   substantially greater in grasslands that had been grazed than those that
   had not been grazed, and larger in arid and semi-arid grasslands than
   those in sub-humid and humid grasslands. Under 50\% precipitation
   increase, ANPP responses were larger in grazed than ungrazed grasslands,
   and bigger in arid and semi-arid than sub-humid and humid grasslands.
   High levels of grazing intensity had greater effects on productivity and
   species richness than did warming and precipitation decrease. Currently,
   although there are increasing number of experiments which have included
   both climate change and grazing factors, more studies are needed to test
   the joint effects of climate change (e.g. warming, changes in
   precipitation patterns) and grazing (grazing intensity and livestock
   type) on biodiversity and multiple ecosystem functions. Multi-factor
   experiments would provide a more comprehensive understanding for
   sustainable grassland management in future.}},

Title = {{Predicting habitat quality of protected dry grasslands using Landsat
   NDVI phenology}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{447-460}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Dry grasslands are species rich and ecologically valuable habitats that
   have experienced a massive decline in Switzerland during the last
   century due to agricultural intensification and land abandonment.
   Appropriate management is a key factor in maintaining habitat quality of
   the remaining most valuable sites and should thus be an essential part
   of monitoring studies. However, information on management is often
   missing and fine-scale patterns are difficult to assess, especially over
   large areas and for past decades.
   The aim of this study was to predict habitat quality of protected dry
   grasslands in Switzerland. Using a nationwide in-situ vegetation data
   set with plot-based species lists, we derived six habitat quality
   indicators (management tolerance, light availability, nutrient content,
   moisture content and species richness). We then tested how well
   satellite-based phenology metrics, in combination with environmental and
   climate data, can predict these dry grassland habitat quality
   indicators. We expected that the seasonal pattern of vegetation
   activity, based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
   would represent local productivity and management patterns, two crucial
   indicators of dry grassland habitat quality. Linear regression analysis
   was conducted to assess the relative importance and ecological
   relationship of different NDVI metrics and other environmental and
   climate predictors for habitat quality. Variance partitioning was
   applied to assess model contributions of the three variable groups which
   represent different data sources for productivity and management.
   Accuracies for the habitat quality prediction models ranged between 34\%
   and 57\% and significant correlations with multiple NDVI metrics were
   found. Including NDVI phonology improved all models by 7-12\%. Single
   contributions of NDVI phenology were highest for management tolerance
   and nutrient content. However, we found high variation of contributions
   between management types. NDVI metrics were highly informative for the
   habitat qualities of abandoned sites, but grazing and mowing reduced or
   even cancelled their predictive power. Moreover, our results demonstrate
   the limitation of single-date NDVI values in predicting habitat quality
   of dry grasslands; in particular pastures and meadows. For monitoring
   applications of dry grasslands, we propose using a combination of NDVI
   metrics, as our results showed that they greatly improve prediction
   results of essential habitat qualities. The Landsat legacy dataset
   facilitates the assessment of habitat changes during past decades and
   can be complemented in the future with higher resolution data, such as
   Sentinel-2, to increase the temporal and spatial resolution so analyses
   are more appropriate for the typically limited size of dry grassland
   habitat sites in Switzerland.}},

Abstract = {{Abandoned cattle (Bos taurus) kraals are sources of habitat
   heterogeneity in dystrophic semi-arid African savannas with a strong
   positive effect on soil nutrients and plant productivity. However,
   little is known regarding how macro-invertebrate assemblages vary
   between abandoned kraals and the surrounding savanna matrix. We tested
   whether herbaceous biomass and basal and aerial covers and soil
   nutrients have an effect on aboveground and belowground
   macro-invertebrate assemblages. Twelve abandoned kraals were contrasted
   with their paired control plots for soil characteristics, herbaceous
   productivity, and macro-invertebrate assemblages in Save Valley
   Conservancy, Zimbabwe. Abandoned kraals had significantly higher
   concentrations of soil nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and
   calcium (Ca) as well as herbaceous biomass and basal and aerial covers
   than control plots. Both aboveground and belowground macro-invertebrate
   species richness were higher on abandoned kraals. However, only
   belowground macro-invertebrate diversity (Shannon H and Hill number 1)
   was significantly higher on abandoned kraals. Soil nutrients and
   herbaceous productivity had positive and significant correlations with
   the dominant taxa (Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Isoptera, and
   Myriapoda) on abandoned kraals. These results add to the growing body of
   evidence that abandoned kraals exert significant effects on savanna
   spatial heterogeneity years later, with implications on ecosystem
   processes and functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Despite considerable research demonstrating that biodiversity increases
   productivity in forests and regulates herbivory and pathogen damage,
   there remain gaps in our understanding of the shape, magnitude, and
   generality of these biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (BEF)
   relationships. Here, we review findings from TreeDivNet, a global
   network of 25 tree diversity experiments, on relationships between
   levels of biodiversity and (a) tree growth and survival and (b) damage
   to trees from pests and pathogens. Tree diversity often improved the
   survival and above- and belowground growth of young trees. The
   mechanistic bases of the diversity effects on tree growth and survival
   include both selection effects (i.e., an increasing impact of particular
   species in more species-rich communities) and complementary effects
   (e.g. related to resource differentiation and facilitation). Plant
   traits and abiotic stressors may mediate these relationships. Studies of
   the responses of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivory and pathogen
   damage have demonstrated that trees in more diverse experimental plots
   may experience more, less, or similar damage compared to conspecific
   trees in less diverse plots. Documented mechanisms producing these
   patterns include changes in concentration, frequency, and apparency of
   hosts; herbivore and pathogen diet breadth; the spatial scale of
   interactions; and herbivore and pathogen regulation by natural enemies.
   Our review of findings from TreeDivNet indicates that tree diversity
   experiments are extending BEF research across systems and scales,
   complementing previous BEF work in grasslands by providing opportunities
   to use remote sensing and spectral approaches to study BEF dynamics,
   integrate belowground and aboveground approaches, and trace the
   consequences of tree physiology for ecosystem functioning. This
   extension of BEF research into tree-dominated systems is improving
   ecologists' capacity to understand the mechanistic bases behind BEF
   relationships. Tree diversity experiments also present opportunities for
   novel research. Since experimental tree diversity plantations enable
   measurements at tree, neighbourhood and plot level, they allow for
   explicit consideration of temporal and spatial scales in BEF dynamics.
   Presently, most TreeDivNet experiments have run for less than ten years.
   Given the longevity of trees, exciting results on BEF relationships are
   expected in the future.}},

Title = {{Good ant, bad ant? Soil engineering by ants in the Brazilian Caatinga
   differs by species}},
Journal = {{GEODERMA}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{323}},
Pages = {{65-73}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{It is commonly acknowledged that ants improve the hydraulic properties
   of soils in which they build their nests. To date, however, most studies
   of such soil modifications have focused on one ant species and one type
   of ecosystem, rather than investigating how different ant species affect
   different types of land cover within the same landscape. Our study
   focused on modifications to water infiltration and surface texture of
   Haplic Luvisols by two ant species one of them present only in a forest
   and the other present only in a pasture. These two sites are located
   near each other in the Caatinga, a tropical dry forest region of Brazil,
   and have similar climatic conditions and soil type. We found that in the
   forest site, soils undisturbed by ant activity already showed water
   infiltration 13 times higher than the similarly undisturbed soils of the
   pasture site; and that the ant Dinoponera quadriceps more than doubled
   water infiltration in their nest annular zones compared with the
   surrounding forest areas. In addition, D. quadriceps increased clay
   content in their mound soils by 50\% compared with the soils of the
   surrounding forest. In contrast, at the pasture site, the leaf-cutter
   ant Atta laevigata had a mixed effect on water infiltration: compared
   with pasture matrix soils, their nest-building activities led to a
   threefold increase in infiltration of the mound soils, but a threefold
   decrease in the nest annular zones. In addition, compared with the
   pasture matrix, A. laevigata almost doubled sand content in their mounds
   which explains the comparatively high infiltration rates. These results
   suggest that the contrasting soil modifications by the two species could
   lead to amplifying feedbacks in opposite directions: an ant species that
   depends on healthy forests is improving water infiltration and soil
   texture (and thus increasing water available to plants) in its
   environment, while another ant species that is known to profit from
   disturbances is having the opposite effect.}},

Abstract = {{Sustained heavy grazing is expected to result in degradation and loss of
   biodiversity in drylands but long-term experiments which assess the
   impact of management practises on biodiversity are necessary. The
   effects of stocking rate (SR) on vegetation composition, abundance of
   different plant functional groups (PFGs), abundance of dominant species,
   and plant diversity were investigated after 27 years at a long-term SR
   trial. Vegetation composition was investigated using Canonical
   Correspondence Analysis and General Linear Models. Stocking rate and
   time had significant effects on species composition. Increases over time
   were apparent for total plant cover, palatable shrub cover, and
   perennial grass cover, annual grass cover decreased over time, whereas
   other PFGs and rangeland condition showed no trend over time. Greater
   stocking rates resulted in lower total plant cover, palatable and
   unpalatable shrub cover, perennial grasses, and annual herbaceous
   species. Higher annual rainfall resulted in higher total plant cover,
   while greater preceding three-month rainfall benefitted annual grasses
   and annual herbaceous species. Plant diversity seemed unaffected by SR.
   Vegetation structure did not seem to be influenced by SR after 27 years.
   Our study confirms the slow rate at which vegetation change occurs in
   drylands and highlights the importance of long-term monitoring trials.}},

   continuously sampled with seven pitfall traps during 1year at 28 sites.
   The harvestman assemblages were classified using six different analyses,
   and indicator species were identified. The spatial patterns of
   harvestman diversity in low areas differed from those of mountain areas,
   although they have 15 species in common. Remarkably, higher average
   harvestman species richness was measured in low Cantabrian areas than in
   mountain areas. Shrublands and boundaries were the most species-rich
   habitats. Forested areas were the poorest in abundance, and were not the
   habitats richest in harvestman species, though they had higher average
   richness than mountain Cantabrian forests. Grasslands had a unique
   harvestman composition with significant extraordinary abundances, in
   particular of Homalenotus quadridentatus (indicator species of this
   habitat) and H. laranderas. Interestingly, H. laranderas, Paroligolophus
   agrestis and Ischyropsalis hispanica, indicator species of some open
   habitats in low Cantabrian areas, have recently been shown to be
   indicators of shady forests in mountain Cantabrian territories.}},

Abstract = {{Iris pseudacorus L., intentionally introduced in Japan as an ornamental
   plant and to improve aquatic environments, has been declared a noxious
   species in the Invasive Alien Species Act of Japan due to the suspected
   high ecological risks to the local species and ecosystems. Although
   prompt responses to I. pseudacorus have been sought to conserve local
   biodiversity, knowledge about its invasiveness is lacking. Here, we
   report the relationship between the establishment of I. pseudacorus and
   floristic changes in semi-wetland vegetation of an abandoned urban pond
   (Aoike), Nara City, Nara Prepecture, Japan. In total, 64 vascular plants
   were recorded in the pond, of which 50 were native species, seven were
   naturalized non-native, and seven were invasive species. On the other
   hand, most of these vascular plants (42 species) were grassland species
   and only several aquatic plants (10 species) were found in this study
   pond. The number of vascular plant species decreased significantly at
   quadrats with a coverage of I. pseudacorus above 50\%. In addition,
   tendencies of lower number of native species and concomitant higher
   number of invasive species were found with increasing coverage of I.
   pseudacorus. From these results, we suggest that it is important to
   preferentially manage sites where the coverage of I. pseudacorus is
   above 50\%, in order to preserve the local biodiversity. Additionally,
   as recommended in the literature, it is essential that the cut
   reproductive organs are kept submerged under deep water for an effective
   control of I. pseudacorus.}},

Abstract = {{In urban areas, the potential of biomass production is rarely utilized,
   although many biomass sources are located in cities, ranging from road
   margins to public parks. There is, however, increasing interest in these
   potential biomass sources, as they are close to consumers and provide
   options to reduce maintenance costs of urban green areas. We analyzed
   the costs and benefits of utilizing biomass, and compared it to the
   biodiversity maintained on 17 urban land use forms the Ruhr Metropolitan
   Area (Germany). Economic costs and benefits were reflected by
   contribution margins, while biodiversity was measured by species numbers
   of plants, birds and butterflies. For the 17 land use types, there is a
   weak overall correlation between contribution margins and species
   numbers. However, this is mainly due to the two land use forms with the
   highest contribution margins (cultivation of energy maize and fertilized
   grassland), which are characterized by the lowest species numbers. For
   the remaining cases, there is no relationship between contribution
   margins and species numbers. Comparatively high contribution margins and
   high mean species numbers were observed for road margins, industrial
   fallows with wood cutting for biogas production and water-influenced
   grassland mown traditionally. We conclude that biomass production and
   the maintenance of urban biodiversity is not necessarily a
   contradiction.}},

Abstract = {{Effective integrated weed management in agricultural landscapes depends
   on the ability to identify and manage processes that drive weed
   dynamics. The current study reports the effects of grazing management
   and crop rotation strategies on the seedbank and emerged weed flora in
   an integrated crop-livestock system (ICLS) experiment during a 12-year
   period under no-tillage in sub-tropical southern Brazil. During winter,
   Italian ryegrass cover crops were grazed by sheep: grazing management
   treatments included two stocking methods (continuous and rotational) and
   two forage allowances (10 and 20 kg of herbage dry matter available per
   100 kg animal live weight). During summer, the crop rotation treatments
   involved either soybean-maize or soybean-soybean in succession with
   winter-grazed cover crops. The treatments were part of a factorial
   randomized complete block design. Treatment effects were evaluated on
   the weed seedbank and emerged weed flora populations during
   winter-grazed cover crop and summer crop growth as well as during the
   harvest phase. The current results demonstrate that crop rotation and
   grazing management exhibited interactive effects on the determination of
   weed outcomes in an ICLS. However, overall, compared with moderate
   forage allowance, high forage allowance during the winter-grazed cover
   crop caused lower emerged weed flora in subsequent crops (20\% reduction
   during crop growth and 90\% reduction at crop harvest) and 48\%
   reduction in seedbank size. High forage allowance promoted more residue
   from winter-grazed cover crop biomass, which remained during the summer
   crop phases and probably resulted in a physical barrier to weed
   emergence.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing effects on arid and semi-arid grasslands can be constrained by
   aridity. Plant functional groups (PFGs) are the most basic component of
   community structure (CS) and biodiversity \& ecosystem function (BEF).
   They have been suggested as identity-dependent in quantifying the
   response to grazing intensity and drought severity. Here, we examine how
   the relationships among PFGs, CS, BEF, and grazing intensity are driven
   by climatic drought. We conducted a manipulative experiment with three
   grazing intensities in 2012 (nondrought year) and 2013 (drought year).
   We classified 62 herbaceous plants into four functional groups based on
   their life forms. We used the relative species abundance of PFGs to
   quantify the effects of grazing and drought, and to explore the
   mechanisms for the pathway correlations using structural equation models
   (SEM) among PFGs, CS, and BEF directly or indirectly. Grazers
   consistently favored the perennial forbs (e.g., palatable or nutritious
   plants), decreasing the plants' relative abundance by 23\%-38\%. Drought
   decreased the relative abundance of ephemeral plants by 42 +/- 13\%; and
   increased perennial forbs by 20 +/- 7\% and graminoids by 80 +/- 31\%.
   SEM confirmed that annuals and biennials had negative correlations with
   the other three PFGs, with perennial bunchgrasses facilitated by
   perennial rhizome grass. Moreover, the contributions of grazing to
   community structure (i.e., canopy height) were 1.6-6.1 times those from
   drought, whereas drought effect on community species richness was 3.6
   times of the grazing treatment. Lastly, the interactive effects of
   grazing and drought on BEF were greater than either alone; particularly,
   drought escalated grazing damage on primary production. Synthesis. The
   responses of PFGs, CS, and BEF to grazing and drought were
   identity-dependent, suggesting that grazing and drought regulation of
   plant functional groups might be a way to shape ecosystem structure and
   function in grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Over-grazing by livestock in semiarid ecosystems is one of the main
   causes of desertification. Although over-grazing contributes to global
   environmental challenge, only a few studies have investigated grazing
   impacts on the composition of species and functional groups of seedling

   species and functional groups, as well as the correlations between the
   seedlings of sparse-elm (Ulmus pumila var. sabulosa or U.pumila) and
   other species changed under three grazing intensities in the degraded
   sparse-elm grassland in the Horqin Sandy Land, China. Species
   composition and abundance of established seedlings were surveyed and the
   relationships between seedlings of U.pumila and other species were
   analyzed. The results showed that plant communities under moderate
   grazing were more stable than the other two grazing intensities due to
   higher seedling density, higher species richness, and higher number of
   perennial herbs. Seedlings of U.pumila could even prevent noxious
   seedlings growth under moderate grazing. We concluded that moderate
   grazing could benefit the recovery of this sparse-elm grassland in the

   Time Series}},
Journal = {{REMOTE SENSING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Grassland use intensity is a topic of growing interest worldwide, as
   grasslands are integral in supporting biodiversity, food production, and
   regulating of the global carbon cycle. Data available for characterizing
   grasslands management are largely descriptive and collected from
   laborious field campaigns or questionnaires. The recent launch of the
   Sentinel-2 earth monitoring constellation provides new possibilities for
   high temporal and spatial resolution remote sensing data covering large
   areas. This study aims to evaluate the potential of a time series of
   Sentinel-2 data for mapping of mowing frequency in the region of Canton
   Aargau, Switzerland. We tested two cloud masking processes and three
   spatial mapping units (pixels, parcel polygons and shrunken parcel
   polygons), and investigated how missing data influence the ability to
   accurately detect and map grassland management activity. We found that
   more than 40\% of the study area was mown before 15 June, while the
   remaining part was either mown later, or was not mown at all. The
   highest accuracy for detection of mowing events was achieved using
   additional clouds masking and size reduction of parcels, which allowed
   correct detection of 77\% of mowing events. Additionally, we found that
   using only standard cloud masking leads to significant overestimation of
   mowing events, and that the detection based on sparse time series does
   not fully correspond to key events in the grass growth season.}},

Abstract = {{Large mammalian herbivores greatly influence the functioning of
   grassland ecosystems. Through plant consumption, excreta, and trampling,
   they modify biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and soil properties. Grazing
   mammals can also alter soil and rhizosphere bacterial communities, but
   their effect on the microbiome of other animals in the habitat (i.e.,
   insects) is unknown. Using an experimental field approach and Illumina
   MiSeq 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we analyzed the influence of cattle
   grazing on the microbial community of spring webworm caterpillars,
   Ocnogyna loewii. Our experimental setup included replicated grazed and
   non-grazed paddocks from which caterpillars were collected twice
   (first-second and fourth-fifth instar). The caterpillars' microbiome is
   composed mostly of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes, and contains a
   potential symbiont from the genus Carnobacterium (55\% of reads). We
   found that grazing significantly altered the microbiome composition of
   late instar caterpillars, probably through changes in diet (plant)
   composition and availability. Furthermore, the microbiome composition of
   early instar caterpillars significantly differed from late instar
   caterpillars in 221 OTUs (58 genera). Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were
   dominant in early instars, while Carnobacterium and Acinetobacter were
   dominant in late instars. This study provides new ecological
   perspectives on the cascading effects mammalian herbivores may have on
   the microbiome of other animals in their shared habitat.}},

Title = {{Differential responses of ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) to
   long-term grassland management in Central Germany}},
Journal = {{MYRMECOLOGICAL NEWS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{27}},
Pages = {{13-23}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Biodiversity decreases in response to either intensive management or
   land abandonment in permanent grasslands of Central Europe. Here, we
   evaluated the long-term impacts of different management regimes on ant
   richness, nest abundance, assemblage structure, and food resource use in
   three experimental grassland sites in Thuringia, Germany. Each
   experimental site comprised identical management regimes established in
   2000/2001. Grassland sites differed with respect to plant community type
   and abiotic conditions. Ants were assessed in four treatments
   representing a gradient in management intensity: intensive mowing
   (four-five cuts per year), traditional mowing (two cuts per year),
   mulching (mulched once per year), and abandonment (no management). A
   total of fourteen species belonging to three genera were recorded.
   Overall, ant responses to management treatments were site dependent.
   Mean species richness did not vary across treatments but sites. Nest
   abundance was high in the intensive and traditional treatment but
   strikingly low in the mulching treatment. Assemblages were more diverse
   in the traditional and abandonment treatment in sites representing
   semi-dry conditions, while the intensive treatment enhanced ant
   diversity under mesic site conditions. Higher rates of food
   monopolization were detected in the intensive and traditional treatment
   in drier conditions. Our results show that long-term management affected
   ant assemblages in different ways, but these effects were strongly
   related to local climate and soil conditions. The responses of ants to
   grassland management, that is mowing, can be explained by how these
   management practices (or their absence) affect the microclimatic
   conditions under a local context. Hence, the interplay of these factors
   along with the species requirements is of key importance to determining
   the impact of the land management on ant assemblages in German and
   Central European grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Large seed banks in the soils of Mediterranean wood pastures can allow
   the composition of the understorey vegetation to adapt to changing
   conditions such as under-grazing, grazing exclusion and climate change.
   This three year study investigated the effect of grazing exclusion on
   the transient and persistent seed banks of 23 areas of a Mediterranean
   wood pasture of Quercus suber L., Q. ilex L. and Q. pubescens Willd. A
   canonical correspondence analysis was used to determine the effect of
   topo-climatic (elevation, aspect, slope, rainfall, temperature, tree
   coverage), soil (pH, soil texture, and soil nitrogen, phosphorus, lime
   and organic carbon content) and biodiversity (Shannon index, species
   richness index, and Pastoral Value) variables on the soil seed bank
   under grazed and ungrazed conditions. The size of the persistent seed
   bank increased with rainfall, grazing, and the available phosphorus
   content of the soil. Specific site by site grazing regimes could
   increase the abundance of legumes in the soil seed bank and the species
   richness and diversity of the understorey vegetation. These results can
   help guide the conservation management of this silvopastoral area.}},

Journal = {{REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Pages = {{1731-1740}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Forests and grasslands have changed during the past 200 years in the
   eastern USA, and it is now possible to quantify loss and conversion of
   vegetation cover at regional scales. We quantified historical (ca.
   1786-1908) and current land cover and determined long-term ecosystem
   change to either land use or closed forests in eight states of the Great
   Lakes and Midwest. Historically, the region was 35\% grasslands (31
   million hectares), 38\% open forests of savannas and woodlands (33
   million hectares), and 25\% closed forests (22 million hectares).
   Currently, the region is about 85\% land use (76 million hectares),
   primarily agriculture, and 15\% closed forests (12 million hectares).
   Land use intensification removed 75\% of open forests, while 25\% of
   open forests have densified to closed forests without low severity
   disturbance to remove understory trees. Historical forest ecosystems
   included a gradient of oak savannas and woodlands with open midstories
   (50 to 250 trees/ha), along with closed old growth forests. Open forests
   have become dense (200 to 375 trees/ha) and are cut frequently,
   resulting in the extremes of closed canopy forests and clearcut openings
   across forested landscapes. We demonstrated that forests have
   transitioned from a historically wide gradient in canopy closure to
   either dense young closed forests with clearcut openings or to various
   land uses (agriculture, grazing, residential and commercial land
   development). The historical abundance of open forest ecosystems,
   composed of both forest and grassland layers, often is not recognized,
   and thus, these forests are undervalued for conservation and management.}},

Title = {{Reptiles and frogs use most land cover types as habitat in a
   fine-grained agricultural landscape}},
Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{502-513}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Agricultural landscapes comprise much of the earth's terrestrial
   surface. However, knowledge about how animals use and move through these
   landscapes is limited, especially for small and cryptic taxa, such as
   reptiles and amphibians. We aimed to understand the influence of land
   use on reptile and frog movement in a fine-grained grazing landscape. We
   surveyed reptiles and frogs using pitfall and funnel traps in transects
   located in five land use types: 1) woodland remnants, 2) grazed
   pastures, 3) coarse woody debris added to grazed pastures, 4) fences in
   grazed pastures and 5) linear plantings within grazed pastures. We found
   that the different land cover types influenced the types and distances
   moved by different species and groups of species. Reptiles moved both
   within, and out of, grazed paddocks more than they did in woodland
   remnants. In contrast, frogs exhibited varying movement behaviours. The
   smooth toadlet (Uperoleia laevigata) moved more often and longer
   distances within remnants than within paddocks. The spotted marsh frog
   (Limnodynastes tasmaniensis) moved out of grazed pastures more than out
   of pastures with coarse woody debris added or fences and were never
   recaptured in plantings. We found that most recaptured reptiles and
   frogs (76.3\%) did not move between trapping arrays, which added to
   evidence that they perceived most of the land cover types as habitat. We
   suggest that even simple fences may provide conduits for movement in the
   agricultural landscape for frogs. Otherwise, most reptile and frog
   species used all land cover types as habitat, though of varying quality.
   Reptiles appeared to perceive the woodland remnants as the highest
   quality habitat. This landscape is fine-grained which may facilitate
   movement and persistence due to high heterogeneity in vegetation cover
   over short distances. Therefore, intensification and increasing the size
   of human land use may have negative impacts on these taxa.}},

Abstract = {{The factors affecting variation in the abundances of invasive mammal
   species have seldom been evaluated at large spatial scales. We used data
   collected in a large-scale biodiversity monitoring program to identify
   variables predicting abundances of common brushtail possums (Trichosurus
   vulpecula; `possum'), a marsupial folivore introduced to New Zealand in
   the 1800s. We sampled possum abundances, vegetation structure and
   composition, and abiotic variables at 395 spatially representative sites
   in natural forest on the North, South and Stewart islands. Records of
   possum control were obtained from management agencies. The large sample
   size enabled us to consider the relative importance of 27 variables for
   possum abundances. Twelve variables explained 80\% of the contributions
   to the final boosted regression tree model. Control history had the
   largest contribution to the model, with sites subject to aerial 1080
   poison baiting either once or more than once in the previous 7 years
   having possum abundances 64\% and 74\% lower, respectively, than sites
   without control. Possum abundances were also negatively related to
   humidity, stem density, tree cover density, slope, elevation and
   distance to pasture/crop. Abundances increased with increasing food
   plant species richness, Weinmannia racemosa (a preferred food tree)
   cover, and solar radiation. There was an interaction between longitude
   and control history. We conclude that invasive possum abundances in New
   Zealand's natural forests are determined by multiple biotic and abiotic
   factors, sometimes in interaction. Recent control operations, however,
   have greatly reduced possum abundances. Increasing the spatial extent of
   aerial 1080 poison baiting will further reduce possum abundances in New
   Zealand forests.}},

Title = {{Similar effects of different mowing frequencies on the conservation
   value of semi-natural grasslands in Europe}},

Abstract = {{Both agricultural intensification and abandonment have led to the loss
   of European semi-natural grasslands. Nature conservation management
   measures like mowing are essential for preserving the biodiversity of
   remaining grasslands. However, there are no conclusive results from
   studies examining effects of different mowing frequencies across Europe.
   To fill this gap, we evaluated data from European studies comparing
   mowing frequencies to determine which are the most beneficial from a
   nature conservation viewpoint. We searched literature for short- and
   long-term studies comparing the effects of different mowing frequencies
   on outcome measures relevant for biodiversity conservation. We found 29
   relevant studies where mowing once per year was compared to higher or
   lower mowing frequencies. The studies covered various grassland types
   and organisms. The effects were analysed using response ratios, where
   mowing once per year, i.e. the traditional mowing frequency in
   semi-natural grasslands, was compared to mowing every fifth, third or
   second year and mowing two, three or four times a year. Overall, we
   found similar effects of the different mowing frequencies on the
   biodiversity of flora and fauna. More frequent mowing generally had a
   more positive effect, but differences between frequencies were small.
   Effects were habitat-specific, differing between site and study
   conditions. For example, a higher mowing frequency was more beneficial
   in more productive grasslands. These results suggest that in most
   European semi-natural grasslands, mowing less frequently is a way of
   using the limited funds available for management more efficiently while
   still maintaining grassland conservation values, but e.g. site
   productivity must be considered when determining a suitable mowing
   frequency.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{155}},
Pages = {{65-72}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Woody encroachment is of global concern in arid and semiarid regions
   around the world. Due to reduction in grass (forage), woody encroachment
   is viewed as ecosystem disservice and degradation, even though this may
   not reduce ecosystem functions. Often, management perceptions of
   degradation remain inadequately informed by knowledge of ecosystem
   processes. We compared 11 biotic variables related to soil and microbial
   functions under shrubs against paired-adjacent grassland:-carbon,
   nitrogen, C:N ratio, organic matter, plant-available N, N-mineralization
   rate, microbial biomass C and N, basal respiration, and
   metabolic-quotient. We summarized these as a multifunction-index. We
   also measured five soil physico-chemical covariates:-pH, conductivity,
   bulk density, texture and water holding capacity. These 11 biotic
   variables were 15-48\% higher under shrubs than under grass;
   multifunction-index was also higher (by 366\%). After accounting for
   spatial autocorrelation and background differences in physico-chemical
   covariates (redundancy analysis), altered ecosystem functions were
   attributable to shrubs. Overall, shrubs can enhance ecosystem functions,
   and maintain important ecological processes through concomitant changes
   in soil physico-chemical properties. While shrubs should not be equated
   to ecological degradation, they present a challenging triage of
   ecosystem service, disservice, and function for grasslands. Management
   strategies could benefit from targeting patterns of nutrient
   redistribution under shrubs.}},

Title = {{Ecosystem engineering through aardvark (Orycteropus afer) burrowing:
   Mechanisms and effects}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{66-72}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Burrowing mammals are often considered to be ecosystem engineers as
   burrowing disturbs the soil, thereby potentially changing resource
   availability and affecting habitat conditions for other species. After
   their excavation, burrows may strongly impact local plant communities
   through several mechanisms, including resource trapping, altered
   chemical and physical soil properties, and amelioration of microclimatic
   conditions. We studied ecosystem engineering by aardvark (Orycteropus
   afer) burrowing by comparing soil and vegetation characteristics between
   three microsites (burrow entrances, excavated soil mounds and adjacent
   control sites). We were able to identify several engineering effects and
   distinguish between potential mechanisms. Burrow soils were cooler,
   drier and less compact than the other microsites, with all three
   microsites representing unique combinations of abiotic conditions. Mean
   species richness was higher at older burrows than mounds and
   non-burrowed controls, despite burrows having a smaller seedbank and not
   differing in soil fertility from mounds and control sites. However, the
   opposite was observed at fresh burrows and mounds, where control plots
   contained more species on average than the other two types of
   microsites. Burrow age and microsite type also affected species
   composition, although only a small proportion of species were
   significantly associated with specific microsites and just two species
   were limited to a single microsite type. We suggest that trampling and
   the physical digging action at burrow entrances, and burial by deposited
   soil at mounds, prevents the establishment of many plant species at
   active burrows. However, once abandoned, burrow entrances provide good
   physical conditions for seedling survival, allowing the establishment of
   more species. Therefore, as suggested previously for other ecosystem
   engineers, it is important to explicitly consider the age and
   degradation processes of engineered structures. In addition, our results
   highlight biologically-important differences in engineering impacts
   between burrow entrances, where soil is removed, and mounds, where soil
   is deposited. Such microscale differences are important to consider when
   examining bioturbation or, more generally, ecosystem engineering.}},

Title = {{Beneath the mistletoe: parasitized trees host a more diverse herbaceous
   vegetation and are more visited by rabbits}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Key message Parasitism by mistletoe increases the cover and diversity of
   herbaceous vegetation under the host tree and attracts the activity of
   rabbits in comparison to control trees. Thus, the effects on forest
   community go beyond the parasitized tree.
   Context Mistletoes are a diverse group of aerial hemiparasitic plants
   and are considered keystone species in forest ecosystems around the
   world. They produce nutrient- enriched litter, which exerts a
   substantial effect on soil- nutrient concentration, and the enriched
   nutrient patch alters the vegetation at the site as well as the
   associated fauna.
   Aims Our goal is to ascertain whether mistletoe (Viscum album)
   parasitism of pine forest of a Mediterranean mountain favors herbaceous
   vegetation and attracts mammalian herbivores.
   Methods We recorded in Sierra de Baza (SE Spain) the composition of the
   herbaceous vegetation under pines with and without mistletoe parasitism,
   and estimated the rabbit activity at the same sites by collecting their
   excrements.
   Results An effect on herbaceous vegetation, especially in grasses
   belonging to the family Poaceae, was reflected in a notable increase in
   soil cover, species richness, and species diversity beneath parasitized
   pines with respect to unparasitized ones. As a consequence, parasitized
   pines attract the activity of rabbits, as shown by a fivefold quantity
   of excrement with respect to control ones.
   Conclusion Parasitism by mistletoe, by creating patches of greater
   nutrient availability under the host canopy, extends its effects beyond
   the host tree to other members of the forest community, such as
   herbaceous plants and associated herbivorous animals, which in turn
   contribute to environmental heterogeneity with their activity.}},

Title = {{How does roadside vegetation management affect the diversity of vascular
   plants and invertebrates? A systematic review}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: With appropriate management, based on vegetation removal
   that reverses late-successional vegetation stages, roadsides can support
   high levels of biodiversity. However, current recommendations for
   roadside management to conserve or restore biodiversity are largely
   based on research on non-roadside grassland habitats, and much of the
   evidence on how roadside management practices affect biodiversity is
   found in non-peer-reviewed grey literature. Therefore, based on
   suggestions from key stakeholders and an initial systematic map that
   identified 97 studies on how biodiversity is affected by vegetation
   removal on roadsides, we conducted a full systematic review of the
   effects on plant and invertebrate diversity of disturbance-based
   maintenance of roadsides.
   Methods: The review was restricted to effects of non-chemical
   interventions such as mowing, burning, grazing and mechanical shrub
   removal. Studies were selected from the systematic map and from an
   updated search for more recent literature using a priori eligibility
   criteria. Relevant articles were subject to critical appraisal of
   clarity and susceptibility to bias, and studies with low or unclear
   validity were excluded from the review. Data on species richness,
   species diversity and abundance of functional groups were extracted
   together with metadata on site properties and other potential effect
   modifiers. Results from the 54 included studies were summarised in a
   narrative synthesis, and impacts of mowing practices on the total
   species richness and diversity of plants and on the abundance of forbs,
   graminoids and woody plants were quantitatively analysed using t tests
   of study-level effect ratios.
   Results: Nearly all of the 54 studies included in the review were
   conducted in Europe (29) or North America (24). The vast majority of
   studies (48) examined impacts of mowing. Effects on vascular plants were
   reported in 51 studies, whereas 8 of the studies reported on
   invertebrates. Quantitative analysis of plant species richness and
   species diversity showed that mowing effects were dependent on the
   interplay between mowing frequency and hay removal. Thus, there were no
   statistically significant overall effects of mowing vs. no mowing,
   frequency of mowing, timing of mowing or hay removal. However, species
   richness was higher in roadsides mowed once or twice per year with hay
   removal than in unmown roadsides, and positively affected by mowing
   twice compared to once per year. Similar, but less pronounced, effects
   were found for plant species diversity. In addition, mowing had a
   negative impact on woody plant abundance, and increased mowing frequency
   had a negative impact on graminoid abundance. The few studies on
   invertebrates showed effects that diverged across taxon groups, and
   there was not enough data for quantitative analysis of these results.
   Conclusions: The results provide evidence on the effects of mowing on
   plant species richness. To increase plant species richness, roadsides
   should be mowed each year, preferably twice per year, and hay should be
   removed after each cutting. The review also identifies large knowledge
   gaps concerning roadside management and its effects on biodiversity,
   especially regarding invertebrates. Hence, this systematic review
   provides not only a valuable basis for evidence-based management but
   also guidance for future research on this topic, essential to inform
   management of road networks for biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Litter decomposition and N release are the key processes that strongly
   determine the nutrient cycling at the soil-plant interface; however, how
   these processes are affected by grazing or grazing exclusion in the
   alpine grassland ecosystems on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is
   poorly understood. So far few studies have simultaneously investigated
   the influence of both litter quality and incubation site on litter
   decomposition and N release. Moreover, previous studies on the QTP
   investigating how grazing exclusion influences plant abundance and
   biodiversity usually lasted for many years, and the short-term effects
   have rarely been reported. This work studied the short-term (6 months)
   effects of grazing and grazing exclusion on plant community composition
   (i.e., plant species presented) and litter quality and long-term (27-33
   months) effects on soil chemical characteristics and mixed litter
   decomposition and N release on the QTP. Our results demonstrate that (1)
   shorter-term grazing exclusion had no effect on plant community
   composition but increased plant palatability and total litter biomass;
   (2) grazing resulted in higher N and C content in litter; and (3)
   grazing accelerated litter decomposition, while grazing exclusion
   promoted N release from litter and increased soil organic carbon. In
   addition, incubation site had significantly more impact than litter
   quality on litter decomposition and N release, while litter quality
   affected decomposition in the early stages. This study provides insights
   into the mechanisms behind the nutrient cycling in alpine ecosystems. We
   suggest that periodic grazing and grazing exclusion is beneficial in
   grassland management on the QTP.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of the rewilding Europe debate, the German national
   strategy on biodiversity aims to dedicate two percent of the German
   state area to wilderness development until 2020. Many of these potential
   large wilderness reserves harbor open habitats that require protection
   according to the Flora-Fauna-Habitat-directive of the European Union. As
   forests prevail in potential natural vegetation, research is required,
   to which extent wild large herbivores and natural disturbances may
   create semi-open landscape patterns in the long-term. We used the
   spatially explicit process-based model of pasture-woodland ecosystem
   dynamics WoodPaM, to analyze the long-term interactions between
   intermediate foraging large wild herbivores and vegetation dynamics in
   edaphically heterogeneous forest-grassland mosaic landscapes. We newly
   implemented a routine for intermediate foraging herbivores. We
   determined herbivore impact on vegetation from the quantitative balance
   between the demand and supply of herbaceous forage and woody browse. In
   abstract landscapes that represent the conditions in the established
   German wilderness area ``Doberitzer Heide{''}, we simulated potential
   future landscape dynamics on open land, in forest and along forest edges
   with and without intermediate foraging large herbivores and for a
   climate change scenario.
   In our simulations the currently open landscape was conserved and even
   more the opening of current oak and beech forest was promoted. Canopy
   thinning and patch-mosaics of oak, birch, poplar and pine stands
   increased the overall nature conservation value in the long-term. To the
   contrary, open habitats were lost in simulations without herbivores.
   Moreover, our simulations suggested that intermediate foraging
   herbivores are especially suitable to maintain semi-open landscapes in
   wilderness areas, because (i) no additional winter forage was required,
   the natural availability of browse was sufficient. (ii) Their grazing
   maintained open land and their browsing thinned tree canopies even on
   poor sites that were unattractive for foraging. Here, habitat was
   maintained for threatened species from dry grasslands.}},

Title = {{New insights into island vegetation composition and species
   diversity-Consistent and conditional responses across contrasting
   insular habitats at the plot-scale}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 6}},
Abstract = {{Most island-ecology studies focus on the properties of entire island
   communities, thus neglecting species-environment relationships operating
   at the habitat-level. Habitat-specific variation in the strength and
   sign of these relationships will conceal patterns observed on the island
   scale and may preclude a mechanistic interpretation of patterns and
   processes. Habitat-specific species-environment relationships may also
   depend on the descriptor of ecological communities. This paper presents
   a comprehensive plot-based analysis of local vegetation composition and
   species diversity (species richness and species evenness) of (i) rocky
   shore, (ii) semi-natural grassland and (iii) coniferous forest habitats
   in three Baltic archipelagos in Sweden. To identify differences and
   consistencies between habitats and descriptors, we assessed the relative
   contributions of the variable-sets ``region{''}, ``topography{''},
   ``soil morphology{''}, ``soil fertility{''}, ``soil water{''}, ``light
   availability{''}, ``distance{''} and ``island configuration{''} on local
   vegetation composition, species richness and species evenness. We
   quantified the impact of ``management history{''} on the descriptors of
   local grassland communities by a newly introduced grazing history index
   (GHI). Unlike species diversity, changes in vegetation composition were
   related to most of the variable-sets. The relative contributions of the
   variable-sets were mostly habitat-specific and strongly contingent on
   the descriptor involved. Within each habitat, richness and evenness were
   only partly affected by the same variable-sets, and if so, their
   relative contribution varied between diversity proxies. Across all
   habitats, soil variable-sets showed highly consistent effects on
   vegetation composition and species diversity and contributed most to the
   variance explained. GHI was a powerful predictor, explaining high
   proportions of variation in all three descriptors of grassland species
   communities. The proportion of unexplained variance was
   habitat-specific, possibly reflecting a community maturity gradient. Our
   results reveal that species richness alone is an incomplete
   representation of local species diversity. Finally, we stress the need
   of including habitat-based approaches when analyzing complex
   species-environment relationships on islands.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{In the present study, an original article about Podolian cattle and its
   milk was performed. In detail, the following factors on reproductive
   career of Podolian cattle in semi-extensive and extensive rearing were
   analysed: age of calving, gestation lenght, calving interval length,
   abortions percentage, conception and calving period. Chemical and
   phisycal parameters (protein, fat and lactose), somatic cell count,
   lisozyme content and antiradical activity, with ABTS and DPPH assays, of
   Podolian milk in semi-extensive and extensive rearing were evaluated.
   Finally, suggestions on future prospects of Podolian milk use were
   proposed: the preparation of hand soap with 5 percentage of podolian
   milk and the potential role of this breed for prevention and propagation
   of fire. The data concerning the reproductive career, milk and
   envinromental role of 677 cows registered in the Herdbook were analysed.
   The results showed that the 58.56\% of the cows manifested a calving
   interval of 11-14 months. The reproductive activity occurred in spring;
   over 70\% of the cows calved in the period February-April. The
   chemical-physical aspects of milk are in agreement with literature. It
   presents an high antioxidant activity values for each group (97.03\% and
   97.50\% for ABTS and 52.09\% and 52.60\% for DPPH, semiextensive and
   extensive system respectively). The consumer test shows that the
   subjects appreciated the soap containing 5\% of Podolian milk for
   different aspect. The data about environmental role were obtained from
   Podolian cows reared in fifteen grazing areas were monitored for five
   years during the summer pasture, when the Podolian cattle graze on green
   grazing areas located in Basilicata region (South of Italy). Therefore,
   an efficient management of grazing by Podolian cattle could be an
   important tool to prevent the fire propagation.}},

Abstract = {{1. The global nitrogen cycle has been greatly perturbed by human
   activities resulting in elevated nitrogen deposition in many parts of
   the world. The threat nitrogen deposition poses to ecosystem function
   and biodiversity is increasingly recognised.
   2. In terrestrial systems, impacts on the plant community are mainly
   through eutrophication and soil acidification. Interactions with
   secondary environmental drivers such as extreme weather and disease are
   also key mechanisms.
   3. Impacts on consumers can be caused by changes in the quality or
   quantity of food as a result of changes in food plant chemistry or
   species composition, changes in vegetation structure leading to a change
   in the availability of prey species, nesting sites or cooled
   microclimates or changes in the phenology of plants leading to causing
   phenological asynchrony.
   4. Pimary consumers have received considerably less research attention
   than plants but negative impacts have been observed for both folivorous
   insects and pollinators. Mammal herbivores have received little research
   attention.
   5. New analysis of changes in plant traits along a gradient of nitrogen
   deposition in the UK shows that plants pollinated by large bees were
   negatively associated with N deposition whilst low pH was associated
   with lower nectar production, reduced occurrence of plants pollinated by
   long-tongued insects and a reduction in plants with larger floral units.
   6. Very few studies have investigated the effects on secondary
   consumers, but those that have suggest that there are likely to be
   negative impacts.
   7. This review identifies considerable knowledge gaps in the impacts of
   N deposition on higher tropic levels and highlights that for many
   groups, knowledge of N deposition impacts is patchy at best. Evidence
   that has been collected suggests that there are likely to be impacts on
   primary and secondary consumers making this a priority area for
   investigation.}},

Title = {{Land use intensity, rather than plant species richness, affects the

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2828-2840}},

Abstract = {{The intensification of land use constitutes one of the main drivers of
   global change and alters nutrient fluxes on all spatial scales, causing
   landscape-level eutrophication and contamination of natural resources.
   Changes in soil nutrient concentrations are thus indicative for crucial
   environmental issues associated with intensive land use. We measured
   concentrations of NO3-N, NH4-N, P, K, Mg, and Ca using 1,326
   ion-exchange resin bags buried in 20cm depth beneath the main root zone
   in 150 temperate grasslands. Nutrient concentrations were related to
   land use intensity, that is, fertilization, mowing, grazing intensities,
   and plant diversity by structural equationmodeling. Furthermore, we
   assessed the response of soil nutrients to mechanical sward disturbance
   and subsequent reseeding, a common practice for grassland renewal. Land
   use intensity, especially fertilization, significantly increased the
   concentrations of NO3-N, NH4-N, K, P, and also Mg. Besides fertilization
   (and tightly correlated mowing) intensity, grazing strongly increased
   NO3-N and K concentrations. Plant species richness decreased P and NO3-N
   concentrations in soil when grassland productivity of the actual year
   was statistically taken into account, but not when long-term averages of
   productivity were used. Thus, we assume that, in the actual study year,
   a distinct drought period might have caused the observed decoupling of
   productivity from fertilization and soil nutrients. Breaking up the
   grassland sward drastically increased NO3-N concentrations (+146\%) but
   reduced NH4-N, P, and K concentrations, unbalancing soil nutrient
   stoichiometry and boosting the risk of N leaching. Reseeding the sward
   after disturbance did not have a short-term effect on nutrient
   concentrations. We conclude that renewal of permanent grassland should
   be avoided as far as possible and future grassland management has to
   strongly rise the effectiveness of fertilization. Additionally,
   grassland management might have to increasingly taking care of periods
   of drought, in which nutrient additions might not increase plant growth
   but potentially only facilitate leaching.}},

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{3226-3235}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is predicted to result in increased occurrence and
   intensity of drought in many regions worldwide. By increasing plant
   physiological stress, drought is likely to affect the floral resources
   (flowers, nectar and pollen) that are available to pollinators. However,
   little is known about impacts of drought at the community level, nor
   whether plant community functional composition influences these impacts.
   To address these knowledge gaps, we investigated the impacts of drought
   on floral resources in calcareous grassland. Drought was simulated using
   rain shelters and the impacts were explored at multiple scales and on
   four different experimental plant communities varying in functional
   trait composition. First, we investigated the effects of drought on
   nectar production of three common wildflower species (Lathyrus
   pratensis, Onobrychis viciifolia and Prunella vulgaris). In the drought
   treatment, L.pratensis and P.vulgaris had a lower proportion of flowers
   containing nectar and O.viciifolia had fewer flowers per raceme. Second,
   we measured the effects of drought on the diversity and abundance of
   floral resources across plant communities. Drought reduced the abundance
   of floral units for all plant communities, irrespective of functional
   composition, and reduced floral species richness for two of the
   communities. Functional diversity did not confer greater resistance to
   drought in terms of maintaining floral resources, probably because the
   effects of drought were ubiquitous across component plant communities.
   The findings indicate that drought has a substantial impact on the
   availability of floral resources in calcareous grassland, which will
   have consequences for pollinator behaviour and populations.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation management practices, such as defoliation may alter the
   composition of plant communities and/or the fungi-forming arbuscular
   mycorrhiza (AMF). We determined the species identity, density, frequency
   and diversity of AMF spores from soil under the canopies of three native
   perennial grass species in rangelands of Argentina: 1) Poa ligularis and
   Nassella tenuis (preferred by livestock) and 2) Amelichloa ambigua (not
   preferred). For each species, plants either remained undefoliated or
   were defoliated twice to a 5 cm stubble height during the growing
   season. Most active meristems remained on the plants after defoliations.
   AMF communities were sampled prior to (i.e., 48 soil samples) and
   following (i.e., 72 soil samples) each defoliation event. Spores were
   grouped in 15 moiphospecies. Density, richness and diversity of AMF
   spores were not influenced by defoliation, and species richness and
   diversity of AMF were similar among species. Total spore density was
   greatest for P. ligularis at the sampling prior to defoliation, but this
   difference did not persist following the defoliation events. The most
   abundant AMF families were: Acaulosporaceae, Diversisporaceae and
   Glomeraceae. These results demonstrate that responses of the studied
   variables were insensitive to the defoliation treatments, and were
   largely unaffected by the studied grass species.}},

Abstract = {{Eight years of excavation work by the Olduvai Geochronology and
   Archaeology Project (OGAP) has produced a rich vertebrate fauna from
   several sites within Bed II, Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Study of these as
   well as recently re-organized collections from Mary Leakey's 1972 HWK EE
   excavations here provides a synthetic view of the faunal community of
   Olduvai during Middle Bed II at similar to 1.7-1.4 Ma, an interval that
   captures the local transition from Oldowan to Acheulean technology. We
   expand the faunal list for this interval, name a new bovid species,
   clarify the evolution of several mammalian lineages, and record new
   local first and last appearances. Compositions of the fish and large
   mammal assemblages support previous indications for the dominance of
   open and seasonal grassland habitats at the margins of an alkaline lake.
   Fish diversity is low and dominated by cichlids, which indicates
   strongly saline conditions. The taphonomy of the fish assemblages
   supports reconstructions of fluctuating lake levels with mass die-offs
   in evaporating pools. The mammals are dominated by grazing bovids and
   equids. Habitats remained consistently dry and open throughout the
   entire Bed II sequence, with no major turnover or paleoecological
   changes taking place. Rather, wooded and wet habitats had already given
   way to drier and more open habitats by the top of Bed I, at 1.85-1.80
   Ma. This ecological change is close to the age of the Oldowan-Acheulean
   transition in Kenya and Ethiopia, but precedes the local transition in
   Middle Bed II.
   The Middle Bed II large mammal community is much richer in species and
   includes a much larger number of large-bodied species (>300 kg) than the
   modern Serengeti. This reflects the severity of Pleistocene extinctions
   on African large mammals, with the loss of large species fitting a
   pattern typical of defaunation or `downsizing' by human disturbance.
   However, trophic network (food web) analyses show that the Middle Bed II
   community was robust, and comparisons with the Serengeti community
   indicate that the fundamental structure of food webs remained intact
   despite Pleistocene extinctions. The presence of a generalized
   meateating hominin in the Middle Bed II community would have increased
   competition among carnivores and vulnerability among herbivores, but the
   high generality and interconnectedness of the Middle Bed II food web
   suggests this community was buffered against extinctions caused by
   trophic interactions. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Irrigation-maintained artificial oases (AO) in arid regions of
   northwestern China provide vital human settlement sites. Recent human
   population increases has caused rapid AO expansion, mainly through
   transforming natural grassland to arable and afforested land. Here, we
   assessed how soil biodiversity is affected by various AO expansion
   strategies, each representing historical land-use regimes.
   We sampled six dominant functional groups of soil biota, covering
   multiple trophic levels: macrofauna consumers (predators and insect
   herbivores), mesofauna decomposers (Oribatida and Collembola), and
   microbial decomposers (bacteria and fungi). Sampling was carried out in
   three AO sites of northwestern China, each containing distinct land
   uses: natural grasslands (NG; non-irrigated), shrub (Haloxylon
   ammodendron) plantations (SP; non-irrigated), tree (Populus gansuensis)
   plantations (TP; irrigated), and arable lands (AL; irrigated).
   The conversion of NG to SP, TP, and AL eliminated or reduced the
   abundance of some NG-adapted taxa. Their replacements were exotic
   species better suited for anthropogenic habitats. As a result, community
   composition shifted in all six functional groups, with greater
   differences between NG and TP and AL than between NG and SP. Based on
   taxonomic gains and losses within each group, we determined that NG to
   SP conversion positively affected diversity among predators, Collembola,
   and fungi, but negatively affected diversity of insect herbivores and
   Oribatida. Bacterial diversity remained unaffected. However, converting
   NG to TP and AL significantly promoted diversity in all six functional
   groups, although effect sizes differed.
   Our results suggest that different AO expansion strategies
   differentially affected the diversity and structure of belowground
   communities, which in turn, cascaded down to ecosystem functioning
   differently. These findings not only contribute to a better
   understanding of how the diversity and community composition within soil
   food-webs respond to land-use change but also provide key insights into
   the development of management strategies for AO ecosystems in drylands
   to mitigate the negative impact of land-use change on soil biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Moderate grazing intensity is considered the basic requirement to
   enhance ecosystem function in grasslands. Yet, deterioration by
   overgrazing is common in many biomes, including Campos grasslands in
   South America. Understanding how grazing management can lead to recovery
   of ecosystem function is essential to design and implement effective
   strategies for sustainable use of this resource. In a long-term field
   experiment carried out in Southern Brazil, we studied the effects of
   temporal grazing exclusions (spring or fall) at moderate and severe
   livestock grazing intensities (maintained by adjusting contrasting
   forage allowances) on the species richness, botanical composition,
   forage mass, sward height, and photosynthetic active radiation
   intercepted. The experiment was arranged in a completely randomized
   design with three replications of grazing exclusions, applied
   simultaneously at moderate and severe grazing intensities. Moderate
   grazing intensity showed a bimodal structure of shorter and taller
   canopies, and high species richness. Severe grazing created a shorter
   and homogeneous sward structure characterized by less standing biomass
   and species loss. In response to grazing exclusions, sward height,
   standing biomass, and light interception recovered almost to the levels
   of moderate grazing. Further, within 2 years grass species richness
   increased and botanical composition changed toward grasses with erect
   habit prevailing in moderate grazing intensity. Our study confirms that
   (1) moderate grazing intensities allow the coexistence of high number of
   species and (2) spring grazing exclusions of long-term overgrazed
   grasslands can lead to a quick start to recover the grass species
   richness, primary productivity, and species composition like that
   prevailing in well-managed grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological restoration is increasingly applied in tropical forests to
   mitigate biodiversity loss and recover ecosystem functions. In
   restoration ecology, functional richness, rather than species richness,
   often determines community assembly, and measures of functional
   diversity provide a mechanistic link between diversity and ecological
   functioning of restored habitat. Vertebrate animals are important for
   ecosystem functioning. Here, we examine the functional diversity of
   small-to-medium sized mammals to evaluate the diversity and functional
   recovery of tropical rainforest. We assess how mammal species diversity
   and composition and functional diversity and composition, vary along a
   restoration chronosequence from degraded pasture to old-growth tropical
   rainforest in the Wet Tropics of Australia. Species richness, diversity,
   evenness, and abundance did not vary, but total mammal biomass and mean
   species body mass increased with restoration age. Species composition in
   restoration forests converged on the composition of old-growth
   rainforest and diverged from pasture with increasing restoration age.
   Functional metrics provided a clearer pattern of recovery than
   traditional species metrics, with most functional metrics significantly
   increasing with restoration age when taxonomic-based metrics did not.
   Functional evenness and dispersion increased significantly with
   restoration age, suggesting that niche complementarity enhances species'
   abundances in restored sites. The change in community composition
   represented a functional shift from invasive, herbivorous, terrestrial
   habitat generalists and open environment specialists in pasture and
   young restoration sites, to predominantly endemic, folivorous, arboreal,
   and fossorial forest species in older restoration sites. This shift has
   positive implications for conservation and demonstrates the potential of
   tropical forest restoration to recover rainforest-like, diverse faunal

Abstract = {{Fluctuations in intensity of human impact and corresponding vegetation
   changes have been reported from different parts of Europe for the period
   from the beginning of the 1st millennium ad to the high Middle Ages. In
   the Bil, Karpaty mountains (White Carpathians), a region well-known for
   its biologically valuable ancient grasslands, an extensive spread of
   woodland could have occurred in the Migration period (4th-6th century)
   and especially in the Confinium period (11th-12th century), when
   settling of this border region was legally prohibited. However, Holocene
   continuity of non-woodland vegetation was suggested as an explanation
   for the unique species richness of the local grasslands. If this
   explanation is true, then the turbulent times in medieval history could
   not have led to complete re-establishment of woodland. To test this idea
   palaeoecologically, we analysed four new profiles from wetland deposits
   for pollen, macrofossils and abiotic proxies, and re-dated some old
   profiles from the area. The results show the continual presence of human
   impact indicators since the Migration period in the southwest of the
   Bil, Karpaty, where these unique grasslands occur. Agricultural
   activities were indicated by pollen of crops, ruderals, weeds and
   grassland taxa and by macrofossils of fen-grassland plants. Grazing and
   burning seem to have been the main disturbances during the older period,
   while mowing of meadows by scythe became more important since the 17th
   century. Fossil records differed among the sites as a consequence of
   differences in altitude and disturbance regimes, but converged gradually
   with time. Despite intensification of human activities, the landscape
   remained mosaic-like. Indicators of undisturbed woodlands have been
   detected only in the northeast. Continuous yet perhaps never too
   intensive disturbances might therefore have maintained the ancient
   grassland species pool in the long term.}},

Abstract = {{In intensively used landscapes, remnant grassland fragments are often
   restricted to places unsuitable for agricultural cultivation. Such
   refuges are the ancient burial mounds called kurgans, which are typical
   landscape elements of the Eurasian steppe and forest steppe zone. Due to
   their hill-like shape, loose soil structure and undisturbed status
   kurgans provide proper habitats for burrowing mammals. Accordingly,
   grassland vegetation on kurgans is often exposed to bioturbation, which
   can influence the habitat structure and plant species pool. In our
   study, we explored the effect of fox burrows and landscape context on
   the habitat properties and vegetation composition of small landscape
   elements, using kurgans as model habitats. We surveyed the vegetation of
   fox burrows and that of the surrounding grassland on five kurgans
   situated in cleared landscapes surrounded by arable lands and five
   kurgans in complex landscapes surrounded by grazed grasslands. We
   recorded the percentage cover of vascular plants, the amount of litter,
   and soil moisture content in twelve 0.5mx0.5m plots per kurgan, in a
   total of 120 plots. We found that foxes considerably transformed habitat
   conditions and created microhabitats by changing the soil nutrient
   availability and reducing total vegetation cover and litter. Several
   grassland specialist species, mostly grasses (Agropyron cristatum,
   Elymus hispidus, and Stipa capillata) established in the newly created
   microhabitats, although the cover of noxious species was also
   considerable. We found that landscape context influenced the sort of
   species which could establish on kurgans by affecting the available
   species pool and soil moisture. Our results revealed that foxes act as
   ecosystem engineers on kurgans by transforming abiotic and biotic
   conditions by burrowing. Their engineering activity maintains
   disturbance-dependent components of dry grasslands and increases local
   environmental heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate grasslands, including those of northern Eurasia, are among the
   most imperiled ecosystems on Earth. Eighty percent ofMongolia's land
   area is rangeland, where interacting climate, land-use and changes in
   governance threaten the sustainability of Mongolia's rangelands and
   pastoral culture. Particularly concerning are the potential ecological
   impacts of changing pastoral grazing practices-namely declining use of
   grazing reserves and pastoral mobility. However, like other grazing
   practices globally, there have been no empirical studies to evaluate the
   effects of specific Mongolian grazing practices on ecological function
   at a management scale. We collected data on the grazing practices of 130
   pastoral households across four ecological zones and sampled ecological
   conditions in their winter pastures. We used a novel social-ecological
   analysis process to (1) develop integrated, holistic indicators of
   ecological function using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis,
   and (2) assess the effects of individual grazing practices on these
   indicators using statistical matching to control for confounding
   management and contextual factors. We identified two latent factors
   related to ecological and pastoral resilience: Factor 1 represents
   resource retention and soil stability and Factor 2 represents species
   richness and functional diversity. Using these two factors as response
   variables, we found that the values of both resilience factors were
   higher in pastures where households made fall or winter otor migrations
   or set aside grazing reserves. This study provides the first
   management-scale empirical test of the ecological response to specific
   grazing practices in Mongolia, using an approach that can be applied in
   other rangeland systems. Our findings highlight the importance to
   ecological and pastoral resilience of supporting traditional pastoral
   practices of mobility and grazing reserves, while also controlling
   stocking densities, increasing rangeland monitoring, and ensuring
   equitable access to state-designated emergency grazing reserves at
   local, regional, and national levels.}},

Abstract = {{The only protected habitat of the endangered autumn buttercup is a
   small, overgrown, wet meadow that no longer supports the species. We
   used an experimentally driven reintroduction to examine the role of
   rodent herbivory in limiting the survival and establishment of autumn
   buttercup at the site. We evaluated the effectiveness of livestock
   grazing and cages to exclude rodents by comparing survival of caged and
   uncaged transplants under two pasture management treatments (grazed vs.
   ungrazed). We found that transplant survival was greatest for caged
   plants in grazed pasture with 50\% of plants surviving to the end of the
   second growing season. Grazing increased the species richness in the
   plant community and decreased the amount of cover for small mammals.
   Accordingly, rodent density and vole herbivory in late summer were
   significantly lower on grazed pasture. Our results indicate that rodent
   herbivores represent a major threat to the survival and reestablishment
   of autumn buttercup and livestock grazing and protective caging are
   effective strategies to reduce rodent populations and vole herbivory.}},

   intensification. We found growing food demand to lead to a significant
   expansion of cropland at the expense of pastures and natural vegetation.
   In our reference scenario, global cropland area increased by more than
   400Mha between 2015 and 2050, mostly in Africa and Latin America.
   Grazing intensification was a main determinant of future land-use
   change. In Africa, higher rates of pasture intensification resulted in
   smaller losses of natural vegetation, and reduced pressure on
   biodiversity hotspots and intact forest landscapes. Investments into
   raising pasture productivity in conjunction with proactive land-use
   planning appear essential in Africa to reduce further losses of areas
   with high conservation value. In Latin America, in contrast, higher
   pasture productivity resulted in increased livestock exports,
   highlighting that unchecked trade can reduce the land savings of pasture
   intensification. Reactive protection of sensitive areas significantly
   reduced the conversion of natural ecosystems in Latin America. We
   conclude that protection strategies need to adapt to region-specific
   trade positions. In regions with a high involvement in international
   trade, area-based conservation measures should be preferred over
   strategies aimed at increasing pasture productivity, which by themselves
   might not be sufficient to protect biodiversity effectively.}},

Abstract = {{Complementarity in light use might increase light exploitation and could
   be an important mechanism explaining the coexistence of multiple species
   in plant communities of increasing diversity. We measured vertical light
   profiles and leaf traits related to light acquisition and light use in
   40 mixtures of varying species richness (SR, 2, 4, 8 and 16) and
   functional group richness (FR, 1-4) in a large grassland biodiversity
   experiment at five different times during the growing season. Light
   attenuation within the canopy differed significantly among mixtures of
   varying SR at peak biomass, with 40\% in 2-species mixtures and up to
   80\% in 16-species mixtures. In contrast, increasing SR did not affect
   light attenuation at the beginning of the growing season or during
   regrowth after mowing, when large fractions of incoming radiation
   reached the ground level. These patterns suggested the presence of
   highly variable light niches over space and time. Trait expression
   differed among functional groups (except specific leaf area (SLA)) and
   varied within the growing season. However, we found no direct effect of
   increased SR or FR on the expression of leaf traits, except for positive
   species richness-effects on SLA at peak biomass time. SLA and stomatal
   conductance increased and leaf dry matter content decreased at lower
   light at leaf height, while leaf greenness was independent of relative
   light availability. Dissimilarity of leaf traits (except SLA) at the
   community level increased with increasing SR. Thus, our results suggest
   that after accounting for light availability, which was driven by SR and
   time of year, variations in leaf trait expression within the grassland
   canopies did not depend on SR, but rather on functional group identity
   and time of year. Consequently, increased complementarity in light use
   at higher plant diversity is due to presence of more species with
   different leaf trait expression and trait variation in response to the
   actual light environment.}},

Title = {{How to fit the distribution of apex scavengers into land-abandonment
   scenarios? The Cinereous vulture in the Mediterranean biome}},
Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{Aim: Farmland abandonment or ecological rewilding shapes species
   distribution and ecological process ultimately affecting the
   biodiversity and functionality of ecosystems. Land abandonment
   predictions based on alternative future socioeconomic scenarios allow
   foretell the future of biota in Europe. From here, we predict how these
   forecasts may affect large-scale distribution of the Cinereous vulture
   (Aegypius monachus), an apex scavenger closely linked to Mediterranean
   agro-grazing systems.
   Location: Iberian Peninsula.
   Methods: Firstly, we modelled nest-site and foraging habitat selection
   in relation to variables quantifying physiography, trophic resources and
   human disturbance. Secondly, we evaluate to what extent land abandonment
   may affect the life traits of the species and finally we determined how
   potential future distribution of the species would vary according to
   asymmetric socioeconomic land-abandonment predictions for year 2040.
   Results: Cinereous vultures selected breeding areas with steep slopes
   and low human presence whereas foraging areas are characterized by high
   abundance of European rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and wild
   ungulates. Liberalization of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) could
   potentially transform positively 66\% of the current nesting habitat,
   favouring the recovery of mature forest. Contrarily, land abandonment
   would negatively affect the 63\% of the current foraging habitat
   reducing the availability of preferred food resources (wild European
   rabbit). On the other hand, the maintenance of the CAP would determine
   lower frequencies (24\%-22\%) of nesting and foraging habitat change.
   Main conclusions: Land abandonment may result into opposite effects on
   the focal species because of the increase in nesting habitats and wild
   ungulates populations and, on the other hand, lower availability of open
   areas with poorer densities of European rabbits. Land-abandonment
   models' scenarios are still coarse-grained; the apparition of new human
   uses in natural areas may take place at small-sized and medium-sized
   scales, ultimately adding complexity to the prediction on the future of
   biota and ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Usable space for northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) has declined
   significantly over the past 3 decades in Texas because non-native
   grasses have replaced native vegetation. We hypothesized that burning
   patches in pastures dominated by buffelgrass (Pennisetum ciliare) and
   OldWorld bluestems (Bothriochloa spp. and Dichanthium spp.) followed by
   livestock grazing would increase limiting habitat attributes, thereby
   increasing usable space and bobwhite demographic parameters and
   population densities. Our study was conducted during 2009-2011 in
   LaSalle County, Texas on a ranch dominated by non-native grasses. Our
   experimental design was composed of 2 blocks with two 240-ha pastures,
   one control (graze only), and one treatment (patch-burn and graze) in
   each. We estimated grass standing crop in grazing exclosures
   (June-September) and habitat attributes along transects (October)
   2009-2011. Bobwhites were captured and monitored via radiotelemetry 2-3
   times/wk during March-November. Means of vegetation metrics important to
   bobwhites such as bare ground, traversibility, and forb and subshrub
   cover were similar between control and treatment units in post-treatment
   years. However, grass standing crop tended to be lower in treatment
   (June and August 2010 and September 2011-110.5 +/- 26.2 g/m(2)) compared
   with control units (June and August 2010 and September 2011-145.5 +/-
   58.6 g/m(2)). Plant species richness was also greater (21\%) in
   treatment (4.6 +/- 0.4/0.1 m(2)) compared with control units (3.8 +/-
   0.4/0.1 m(2)) during the last year of the study (P = 0.057). Patch
   heterogeneity was increased in treatment units. There was an increase in
   bobwhite densities in treatment units, although demographicmetrics
   remained similar between treatment and controls. Patch burning and
   grazing is a viable tool for managing monotypic non-native grasslands
   for bobwhites in semiarid environments. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier

Volume = {{55}},

Abstract = {{1. Land management is critical for biodiversity conservation in mountain
   grasslands. It should be both ecologically effective and economically
   efficient. We provide an economic analysis of different options (spring
   and autumn grazing, mowing and abandonment) and their effects on
   population viability of a rare plant species, Eryngium alpinum
   (Apiaceae), in two French mountain grassland sites (Fournel and
   Pralognan).
   2. Using data collected in a 10-year individual-based demographic study,
   we estimated the effects of land management options on the population
   growth rate and simulated the effect of combinations of options. Income
   earned through each option was estimated using data on associated costs
   (price of consumables, working time and wages) and benefits (forage
   production, quality and price), and we assessed the economic effects of
   agri-environment subsidies (AESs). We also simulated the effects of
   increased frequencies of extreme climatic events (such as the 2003
   heatwave).
   3. Spring grazing was the worst option for E. alpinum demography but the
   best in economic terms, as it provided net positive incomes. Autumn
   grazing was the best option, resulting in positive growth rates and
   incomes, even if the latter were lower than for spring grazing. Mowing
   was the second best option for demography but resulted in economic
   losses for farmers. Abandonment provided zero -income and was not
   favourable to population growth.
   4. In Fournel, AESs allowed for economically and ecologically
   near-optimal combinations of management options. In Pralognan,
   alternating years of grazing with mowing resulted in an acceptable
   compromise, with positive growth rates and incomes, but AESs were not
   sufficient to cover the opportunity cost of spring and autumn grazing.
   Mowing was also unattractive because of the inaccessibility of the site
   and impossibility to recover the hay to make forage.
   5. Simulations with increased frequency of extreme climatic events
   resulted in negative growth rates in Pralognan, questioning the
   continuation of AESs in extinction-prone populations.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The conservation effectiveness and
   economic efficiency of grassland management could be improved by
   alternating practices over several years. However, existing
   agri-environment subsidies would barely be sufficient to increase uptake
   of the most favourable land management options for biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of factors that determine the distribution of
   top-scavengers at large scales can provide clues to understanding
   important ecological processes and may be useful in establishing
   conservation and management strategies. Here, we conducted a large-scale
   survey to study the distribution of the threatened Andean Condor Vultur
   gryphus in relation to environmental factors in southern Patagonia. This
   area has undergone the settlement of livestock and the introduction of
   exotic wildlife, although to a lesser extent than in the distribution of
   Condors in northern Patagonia. The aim of this study was to determine
   the relevance of different factors such as the availability of food
   resources, the availability of suitable nesting and roosting places and
   the presence of humans on large-scale condor distribution. Our results
   show that the presence of meadows was the primary factor shaping Andean
   Condor distribution, despite the fact that this habitat occupies only
   4\% of the Patagonian landscapes. However, this habitat has a high
   probability of herbivore presence, so Condors seem to optimize their
   searching. The availability of nesting and roosting cliffs also
   contributed to explaining the observed distributions. Our results

Abstract = {{Ephemeral gilgai wetlands of the stony-plains of arid Australia have a
   relatively high diversity of native plant species and are extensively
   utilised for livestock grazing. We sampled the standing vegetation (SV)
   and germinable soil seed bank (SSB) of 40 gilgais, comparing gilgais
   near and far from watering points, and continually stocked versus rarely
   stocked. Despite historically heavy stock grazing, we found no
   significant differences in native species richness between treatments,
   indicating the general resilience of gilgai vegetation. One contributing
   factor is the abundance of Atriplex nummularia ssp. omissa. Cover of
   this long-lived shrub did not differ significantly between treatments
   and was positively correlated with ``highly palatable{''} species'
   cover, suggesting that it may act as a nurse species. In contrast, two
   other long-lived species, Atriplex vesicaria and Astrebla pectinate, had
   significantly reduced cover or were absent near to watering points.
   These and other long-lived species had a poorly developed SSB and thus
   limited ability to regenerate from seed if killed by sustained heavy
   grazing. The absence of fifteen locally rare species (including 12
   short-lived species) from water-near gilgais indicates the need for more
   intensive survey to determine whether the proliferation of watering
   points poses a threat to such species.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1020-1031}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Very few studies have examined whether the impacts of grazing
   disturbance on soil seed banks occur directly or indirectly through
   aboveground vegetation and soil properties. The potential role of the
   seed bank in alpine wetland restoration is also unknown. We used SEM
   (structural equation modeling) to explore the direct effect of grazing
   disturbance on the seed bank and the indirect effect through aboveground
   vegetation and soil properties. We also studied the role of the seed
   bank on the restoration potential in wetlands with various grazing
   intensities: low (fenced, winter grazed only), medium (seasonally
   grazed), and high (whole-year grazed). For the seed bank, species
   richness and density per plot showed no difference among grazing
   intensities for each depth (0-5, 5-10, 10-15 cm) and for the whole depth
   (0-15 cm) in spring and summer. There was no direct effect of grazing
   disturbance on seed bank richness and density both in spring and summer,
   and also no indirect effect on the seed bank through its direct effect
   on vegetation richness and abundance. Grazing disturbance indirectly
   increased spring seed bank density but decreased summer seed bank
   density through its direct effect (negative correlation) on soil
   moisture and total nitrogen and its indirect effect on vegetation
   abundance. Species composition of the vegetation changed with grazing
   regime, but that of the seed bank did not. An increased trend of
   similarity between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation with
   increased grazing disturbance was found in the shallow depth and in the
   whole depth only in spring. Although there was almost no change in seed
   bank size with grazing intensities, grazing disturbance increased the
   quantity of transient seeds but decreased persistent seeds. Persistent
   seeds stored in the soil could play a crucial role in vegetation
   regeneration and in restoration of degraded wetland ecosystems. The seed
   bank should be an integral part of alpine wetland restoration programs.}},

Abstract = {{Theory argues that both soil conditions and aboveground trophic
   interactions have equivalent potential to limit or promote plant
   diversity. However, it remains unexplored how they jointly modify the
   niche differences stabilising species coexistence and the average
   fitness differences driving competitive dominance. We conducted a field
   study in Mediterranean annual grasslands to parameterise population
   models of six competing plant species. Spatially explicit floral visitor
   assemblages and soil salinity variation were characterised for each
   species. Both floral visitors and soil salinity modified species
   population dynamics via direct changes in seed production and indirect
   changes in competitive responses. Although the magnitude and sign of
   these changes were species-specific, floral visitors promoted
   coexistence at neighbourhood scales, while soil salinity did so over
   larger scales by changing the superior competitors' identity. Our
   results show how below and aboveground interactions maintain diversity
   in heterogeneous landscapes through their opposing effects on the

Abstract = {{Land-use changes, pollution and climate warming during the 20th century
   have caused changes in biodiversity across the world. However, in many
   cases, the environmental drivers are poorly understood. To identify and
   rank the drivers currently causing broad-scale floristic changes in N
   Europe, we analysed data from two vascular plant surveys of 200 randomly
   selected 2.5 x 2.5 km grid-squares in Scania, southernmost Sweden,
   conducted 1989-2006 and 2008-2015, respectively, and related the change
   in frequency (performance) of the species to a wide range of
   species-specific plant traits. We chose traits representing all
   plausible drivers of recent floristic changes: climatic change (northern
   distribution limit, flowering time), land-use change (light requirement,
   response to grazing/mowing,response to soil disturbance), drainage
   (water requirement), acidification (pH optimum), nitrogen deposition and
   eutrophication (N requirement, N fixation ability, carnivory,
   parasitism, mycorrhizal associations), pollinator decline (mode of
   reproduction) and changes in CO2 levels (photosynthetic pathway). Our
   results suggest that climate warming and changes in land-use were the
   main drivers of changes in the flora during the last decades. Climate
   warming appeared as the most influential driver, with northern
   distribution limit explaining 30\%-60\% of the variance in the GLMM
   models. However, the relative importance of the drivers differed among
   habitat types, with grassland species being affected the most by
   cessation of grazing/mowing and species of ruderal habitats by on-going
   concentration of both agriculture and human population to the most
   productive soils. For wetland species, only pH optimum was significantly
   related to species performance, possibly an effect of the increasing
   humification of acidic water bodies. An observed relative decline of
   mycorrhizal species may possibly be explained by decreasing nitrogen
   deposition resulting in less competition for phosphorus. We found no
   effect of shortage or decline of pollinating lepidopterans and bees.}},

Abstract = {{Most of our knowledge of the effect of grazing on grassland structure is
   based on grazed-ungrazed contrasts. The effects of grazing in the most
   common scenario, where grazing intensity varies from low to high grazing
   intensity, are less known. The objectives of this paper were to 1)
   quantify the effect of stocking rates on species richness and diversity
   of grasslands world-wide, and 2) evaluate the response under different
   environmental and experimental conditions. We conducted a meta-analysis
   of experiments with at least two levels of controlled stocking rates and
   evaluated their effect on species richness and diversity. The results
   showed that the response of richness and diversity to either reducing or
   increasing stocking rate from a moderate level mostly fell within the
   range 25\% or 5 species. Mean response of species richness and diversity
   to increasing stocking rate from moderate to high levels was negative.
   Mean response to lowering stocking rate from moderate levels was not
   different from zero. However, overall, species richness significantly
   decreased as stocking rate increased. The response of richness and
   diversity to stocking rate was not related to mean precipitation,
   productivity or aridity. However, the most negative responses of
   richness to stocking rate were larger in arid, low productivity systems
   than in subhumid and humid systems. The effects of grazing on richness
   and diversity found in this review were smaller than the effects on
   species composition shown by the literature. Thus, grazing drastically
   changes species composition, but the net change of species and diversity
   is much smaller.}},

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{127}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{780-791}},

Abstract = {{Metacommunity theory emphasizes that seed dispersal not only limits but
   equally maintains plant diversity, though the latter receives little
   empirical attention. Discerning the temporal and spatial components of
   seed dispersal and understanding how their interaction shapes fragmented
   communities and maintains their diversity may be pivotal to further our
   ecological understanding of spatial and temporal seed dispersal and its
   implications for landscape-scale conservation management. To investigate
   the relative importance of spatial and temporal seed dispersal and their
   roles in maintaining plant diversity, the herb layer and seed bank of
   grassland communities were inventoried in 77 sites across abandoned and
   intact rotational grazing networks in a 100 km(2) fragmented grassland
   landscape in the Stockholm archipelago (Baltic Sea, Sweden). Besides
   analysing alpha- and beta-diversity patterns, nestedness analyses
   connect deterministic community changes and diversity losses with
   dispersal-related life-history traits and habitat specialization to
   identify the mechanism driving community changes and maintaining local
   diversity. The loss of rotational grazing networks caused community
   diversity declines via non-random extinctions of spatially and
   temporally poor dispersers, particularly among grassland specialists.
   Temporal seed dispersal halted further community disassembly,
   maintaining diversity in the abandoned grazing networks. Spatial
   dispersal within the intact grazing networks was found to be an
   overriding, homogenizing agent conserving diversity in both the herb
   layer and seed bank. This empirical evidence establishes how spatial and
   temporal seed dispersal interact to maintain diversity in fragmented
   landscapes. Poorly connected grasslands appear limited by spatial
   dispersal, yet are maintained by temporal seed dispersal. In fragmented
   landscapes where grazing networks are rarely present, temporal rather
   than spatial seed dispersal may be more important in maintaining species
   diversity, since effective spatial dispersal may be significantly
   diminished. The grazing network's efficacy at boosting spatial dispersal
   and upholding community diversity presents a powerful management tool to
   conserve local and regional species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{In low-mountain secondary grasslands of central Apennines, grazing
   cessation and undergrazing foster Brachypodium rupestre invasion,
   threatening the 6210{*} habitat (92/43/EEC Directive). The research aim
   was to understand the effect of multi-annual mowing and litter removal
   on recovery of coenological composition of a B. rupestre-invaded
   grassland. One hectare of grassland was mown, in late June and October,
   for 6 years, removing litter and hay. Before the first yearly mowing, we
   collected species and litter cover in 30 randomly selected plots (0.5 x
   0.5 m). Festuco-Brometea/Festuco-Ononidetea species promptly increased,
   in number and abundance, in response to B. rupestre and litter removal,
   but decreased in the second half of the treatment, being partly replaced
   by Molinio-Arrhenatheretea species, progressively fostered by litter
   reduction. Litter removal also explained the increase in abundance of
   Sedo-Scleranthetea/Helianthemetea guttati species, whose richness peaked
   at treatment end, indicating the potential for higher species richness
   and the formation of patches of 6110{*} and 6220{*} habitats. Fringe and
   successional species decreased in richness and abundance, without a
   linear trend. The number of diagnostic taxa of the 6210{*} habitat
   increased significantly with the reduction of B. rupestre and litter,
   although the frequency/abundance of most of them did not change
   significantly, indicating that the studied community could be still
   considered habitat of community interest, although in a low conservation
   status. The treatment was effective in restoring grassland composition,
   although the achievement and maintenance of a favourable conservation
   status for the 6210{*} habitat require a long-term management planning,
   including sheep grazing during late spring/summer.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence from experimental grasslands indicated that plant biodiversity
   modifies the water cycle, but it is unclear if this is also true for
   established land-use systems. Therefore, we investigated how actual
   evapotranspiration (ETa), downward flux (DF), and upward flux (UF) in
   soil are related with land use and plant diversity in agriculturally
   managed grassland. In three Central European regions (Biodiversity
   Exploratories), we studied 29 grassland plots (50x50m; 9-11 plots per
   region) covering the land-use classes pasture, mown pasture, and meadow,
   in at least triplicate per region. From 2010 to 2015, we measured soil
   moisture, meteorological conditions, plant species richness, cover, and
   number of species in the functional groups of grasses, herbs, and
   legumes, aboveground biomass and root biomass on each plot. Annual ETa,
   DF, and UF were calculated for two soil layers with a soil water balance
   model and statistically analysed for land-use and biodiversity effects
   with analysis of variance. Water fluxes were not significantly affected
   by land-use class. UF did not vary between plots with different species
   richness and plant functional group composition. DF from topsoil
   increased with increasing number of grass species. ETa from topsoil
   decreased with increasing species richness and with the number of herb
   or legume species, whereas ETa from subsoil increased. Our results
   demonstrate that plant diversity influences the soil depth partitioning
   of water use, but the complex drivers of this relationship in
   agriculturally managed grassland still need to be disentangled.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between sward diversity and forage selectivity of cattle
   and sheep managed within mixed grazing systems are not fully understood.
   The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of either
   mono- or co-grazing of sheep and cattle on swards differing in botanical
   composition (either diverse or grass-dominated) on the intake choices of
   six target forage species. Jacobs' selection index (JSI) was employed to
   quantify the preference for single target species in relation to their
   proportion in the sward. Results revealed distinct intake preferences of
   sheep and cattle; as expected, sheep were more selective than cattle. To
   a lesser extent, the sward composition had an effect on intake
   preferences: cattle responded to botanical composition by changing their
   intake preferences, but to a lesser extent than sheep. Phleum pratense
   was the most preferred target forage species (JSI = 0.62). Lolium
   perenne, Taraxacum sect. Ruderale and Trifolium repens were also highly
   preferred regardless of sward composition or type of grazing (JSI =
   0.47, 0.32 and 0.27 respectively). Dactylis glomerata and Festuca
   pratensis tended to increase in abundance after grazing events in both
   diverse and grass-dominated swards. Co-grazing of cattle and sheep
   facilitated a more homogeneous consumption of the target forage species
   evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{The common forage grass Lolium perenne has evolved with the systemic
   fungal endophyte Epichloe festucae var. lolii. The endophyte provides
   herbivore resistance to the grass due to defensive alkaloids, some of
   which are toxic to grazing livestock. In this field study, we determine
   whether distribution of the endophyte-grass association changes along a
   land-use intensity gradient on 87 managed grasslands in three German
   regions. Endophyte infections were detected in 66\% of the studied sites
   and infection rates within infected sites ranged from 1\% to 95\%.
   Alkaloid concentrations of lolitrem B (vertebrate toxin) exceeded the
   toxicity thresholds in 50 (14\%) of 351 infected plants and of peramine
   (invertebrate deterrent/toxin) in 12 (3\%) of 351 plants. Infection
   rates and alkaloid concentrations were not significantly affected by
   land-use intensity and region, but alkaloid concentrations were higher
   in summer compared to spring. We conclude that risks for livestock
   intoxication are currently low, as (i) average alkaloid concentrations
   per grassland were always below toxicity thresholds and as (ii) none of
   the grasslands was dominated by L.perenne. We suggest avoidance of grass
   monocultures in Europe to keep intoxication risks for livestock low; we
   also recommend regular examination of seeds and grasslands, as seed
   producers might accidentally distribute infected seeds, and as climate
   warming might further enhance the distribution of Epichloe endophytes in
   European grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the specific role of exotic species on measures of
   grassland plant diversity, including how this may vary with climatic
   conditions or large mammal herbivory. This study examined vegetation
   responses to long-term livestock grazing, including plant richness and
   diversity, as well as the contribution of exotic species to these
   metrics, across a network of 107 northern temperate grasslands in
   Alberta, Canada, spanning a broad aridity gradient. Exposure to grazing
   modestly increased plant richness, but did not alter Shannon' s
   diversity, Simpson' s diversity, or evenness, suggesting stability in
   floral diversity relative to grazing. However, grazing did increase
   grass cover while reducing shrub cover, the latter of which was only
   apparent in mesic grasslands. Unlike total plant diversity, exotic
   species richness and cover, together with exotic plant contributions to
   diversity, varied jointly with grazing and aridity. While long-term
   grazing increased exotic species, this response was most apparent in
   wetter areas, and non-grazed grasslands remained more resistant to the
   presence of exotics. Several exotic species were positive indicators of
   grazing in wetter grasslands, and coincided with lower native species
   cover, indicating grazing may be facilitating a shift from native to
   exotic vegetation under these conditions. Overall, our results indicate
   that while long-term grazing has altered the composition and cover of
   certain functional groups, including favoring exotics and minimizing
   woody vegetation in mesic areas, overall changes to plant diversity were
   limited. Additionally, these findings suggest that semi-arid northern
   temperate grasslands remain relatively resistant to grazing effects,
   including their susceptibility to exotic plant encroachment. These
   results improve our understanding of how ongoing grazing exposure may
   impact grassland diversity, including efforts to conserve native
   vegetation, as well as the important role of climate in altering
   fundamental grassland responses to grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Worldwide, native grasslands are being converted to non-native pastures
   and cropland. This process threatens local grassland biomes as well as
   the livelihoods of farm families that utilize these grasslands.
   In the Rio de la Plata grasslands region meat production and
   multispecies native grasslands have coexisted for more than 400 years.
   Low levels of meat productivity and farm income, however, trigger
   replacement of native grasslands by crops and leys and threaten the
   survival of local beef farming systems. We studied the economic and
   environmental performance of beef farming in the region based on
   interviews and field measurements on 280 case study farms with the
   following aims: (a) to identify the multi-functional economic and
   environmental performance of beef farms across the Rio de la Plata
   grasslands biome; (b) to identify farms with `outstanding'
   multi-functional performance; (c) to compare performance levels with
   those found in other regions; and (d) to discuss the implications of the
   outstanding farms for the development of new systems of meat production.
   The representativeness of the case study farms was ascertained by
   comparing them with a farm typology constructed from survey data of
   15,448 beef farms situated predominantly on native grasslands in
   Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay. We identified seven farm types on the
   basis of farm size, labour, farm specialization, land use and stocking
   rate.
   We identified positive deviant farms based on Pareto-ranking and
   compared these with a classification based on threshold values provided
   by experts. Out of the 280 farms, 41 were ranked as Pareto-optimal, i.e.
   out-performed other farms in one or more indicators without being
   outperformed in other indicators. Out of these, 5 were positive
   deviants, achieving on average 192 kg LW ha(-1) yr(-1) of livestock
   productivity and 201 US\$ ha(-1) year(-1) farm income, having most
   favourable values for fossil energy consumption, phosphorus balance,
   carbon footprint and having over 95\% of their land under native
   grassland as a proxy for biodiversity conservation value. Four of these
   farms belonged to farm types that together represented 55\% of the
   population, suggesting scope for widescale improvement.
   Compared to the values reported for the OECD countries the beef farming
   systems of the Rio de la Plata grasslands region consume less energy and
   positive deviant farms demonstrated approximately average livestock
   productivity and carbon footprint. Increasing livestock productivity in
   the Rio de la Plata grasslands region resulted in a stronger decline of
   the carbon footprint without compromising the current negligible levels
   of fossil fuel energy use. Further elucidation of management practices
   that lead to positive deviant performance will require modelling of the
   interaction of pasture and herd dynamics at farm level and is needed to
   support targeted policy support for sustainable natural grassland-based
   beef production in the region.}},

Abstract = {{The impacts of climate extremes on species, communities and ecosystems
   have become critical concerns to science and society. Under a changing
   climate, how restoration outcomes are affected by extreme climate
   variables is a largely unknown topic. We analyzed the effects of
   experimental factors (grazing and sowing of native species), extreme
   climate events (intense precipitation and extreme temperatures indexes)
   and their combination on the restoration progress of a dry, calcareous
   grassland in Tuscany (Italy) with a 1 year before/15 years continuous
   annual monitoring after, control/impact (BACI) experiment. Grazing had a
   beneficial effect on the diversity of the grassland, while sowing had a
   limited impact. The climatic index that most affected the entire plant
   community composition was the number of very heavy precipitation days.
   The interaction of grazing and extreme climatic indexes had a
   significant detrimental effect on restoration outcomes, increasing the
   cover of synanthropic and Cosmopolitan-Subcosmopolitan generalist
   species and decreasing the cover of more valuable species such endemic
   species. In the richest grazed plots, species richness showed a lower
   sensitivity to the average precipitation per wet day but in grazed site,
   restoration outcomes can be negatively influenced by the intensification
   of precipitation and temperature extremes. In a context of progressive
   tropicalization of the Mediterranean area, to assist managers setting
   achievable restoration goals, restoration practitioners should consider
   that climate extremes might interfere with the beneficial effects of
   restoration practices. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2018}},

Abstract = {{Plateau pikas (Ochotona curzoniae), burrowing lagomorphs endemic to the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), are considered pests by Chinese
   authorities because of their association with grasslands that are
   characterized as degraded. Officials typically blame pikas for causing
   the degraded conditions, whereas studies increasingly suggest that
   sparse vegetation encourages population growth and high densities of
   pikas. Correlational investigations that document pika density while
   simultaneously describing grassland conditions can quantify this
   association, but are uninformative regarding causation. We used
   livestock exclosures and pika reductions in partially controlled
   experiments to examine how pika habitat use responds to changes in
   vegetation structure caused by wintertime livestock grazing. Mean counts
   of pikas were higher on grazed than ungrazed plots. Linear models
   accounting for experimental pika reduction as well as seasonal phenology
   indicated that grazing significantly increased pika use compared with
   ungrazed plots. These results show that moderate livestock density is
   likely consistent with both biodiversity conservation and economic
   activity, and that high pika populations alone are not responsible for
   observed degradation of the QTP alpine grasslands. Moderate levels of
   livestock grazing and pika presence are consistent with maintaining the
   integrity of the alpine steppe ecosystem of the QTP.}},

Title = {{Urbanization alters small rodent community composition but not abundance}},
Journal = {{PEERJ}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 30}},
Abstract = {{Desert ecosystems are one of the fastest urbanizing areas on the planet.
   This rapid shift has the potential to alter the abundances and species
   richness of herbivore land plant communities. Herbivores, for example,
   are expected to be more abundant within urban desert remnant parks
   located within cities due to anthropogenic activities that concentrate
   food resources and reduce native predator populations. Despite this
   assumption, previous research conducted around Phoenix, AZ, USA has
   shown that top-down herbivory led to equally reduced plant biomass in
   both urban and outlying locations. It is unclear if this insignificant
   difference in herbivory at urban and outlying sites is due to unaltered
   desert herbivore populations or altered activity levels that counteract
   abundance differences. Small rodent herbivore/granivore populations were
   surveyed at four sites inside and four sites outside of the core of
   Phoenix during fall 2014 and spring 2015 in order to determine whether
   abundances and richness differ significantly between urban and rural
   sites. In order to survey species composition and abundance at these
   sites, 100 Sherman traps and eight larger wire traps that are designed
   to attract and capture small vertebrates such as mice, rats, and
   squirrels were set at each site for two consecutive trap nights. Results
   suggest that the commonly assumed effect of urbanization on herbivore
   abundances does not apply to small rodent populations in a desert city,
   as overall small rodent abundances were statistically similar regardless
   of location. Though a significant difference was not found for species
   richness, a significant difference between small rodent genus richness
   at these sites was observed, with altered community composition. The
   compositional differences likely reflect the altered vegetative
   community and may impact ecological interactions at these sites.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 29}},
Abstract = {{Large areas of farmland are abandoned in Norway, which for various
   reasons are regarded as undesirable. Loss of farmland may have negative
   implications for biodiversity and ecosystem function and food production
   potential. The objectives of this study were to assess forage mass
   production and utilization, botanical composition, lamb performance, and
   grazing distribution pattern when reintroducing livestock grazing to an
   abandoned grassland. The study area was located in Central Norway,
   unmanaged for 12 years. Sheep grazed the area for 10 weeks in 2013 and 4
   weeks in spring and autumn, respectively, in 2014 and 2015. During the
   summer of 2014 and 2015, the area was subjected to the following
   replicated treatments: (1) No grazing, (2) grazing with heifers, and (3)
   grazing with ewes and their offspring. The stocking rate was similar in
   the grazed treatments. Forage biomass production and animal intake were
   estimated using grazing exclosure cages and botanical composition by
   visual assessment. Effect on lamb performance was evaluated by live
   weight gain and slaughter traits in sheep subjected to three treatments:
   (1) Common farm procedure with summer range pasturing, (2) spring
   grazing period extended by 1 month on the abandoned grassland before
   summer range pasturing, and (3) spring and summer grazing on the
   abandoned grassland. Grazing distribution patterns were studied using
   GPS position collars on ewes. Total annual biomass production was on
   average 72\% higher with summer grazing than without. Annual consumption
   and utilization was on average 218 g DM/m(2) and 70\% when summer
   grazed, and 25g DM/m(2) and 18\% without grazing, respectively.
   Botanical composition did not differ between treatments. Live weight
   gain was higher in lambs subjected to an extended spring grazing period
   (255 g/d) compared to common farm practice (228 g/d) and spring and
   summer grazing on the abandoned grassland (203 g/d), and carcass value
   was 14\% higher in lambs on extended spring grazing compared to common
   farm practice. In autumn, sheep preferred to graze areas grazed by sheep
   during summer. Re-introduction of grazing stimulated forage production,
   and extended spring grazing improved performance in lambs. This study
   has quantified the value of abandoned grassland as a feed resource.}},

Title = {{Agricultural matrices affect ground ant assemblage composition inside
   forest fragments}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{The establishment of agricultural matrices generally involves
   deforestation, which leads to fragmentation of the remaining forest.
   This fragmentation can affect forest dynamics both positively and
   negatively. Since most animal species are affected, certain groups can
   be used to measure the impact of such fragmentation. This study aimed to
   measure the impacts of agricultural crops (matrices) on ant communities
   of adjacent lower montane Atlantic rainforest fragments. We sampled nine
   forest fragments at locations surrounded by different agricultural
   matrices, namely: coffee (3 replicates); sugarcane (3); and pasture (3).
   At each site we installed pitfall traps along a 500 m transect from the
   interior of the matrix to the interior of the fragment (20 pitfall
   traps-25 m apart). Each transect was partitioned into four categories:
   interior of the matrix; edge of the matrix; edge of the fragment; and
   interior of the fragment. For each sample site, we measured ant species
   richness and ant community composition within each transect category.
   Ant richness and composition differed between fragments and matrices.
   Each sample location had a specific composition of ants, probably
   because of the influence of the nature and management of the
   agricultural matrices. Species composition in the coffee matrix had the
   highest similarity to its corresponding fragment. The variability in
   species composition within forest fragments surrounded by pasture was
   greatest when compared with forest fragments surrounded by sugarcane or,
   to a lesser extent, coffee. Functional guild composition differed
   between locations, but the most representative guild was `generalist'
   both in the agricultural matrices and forest fragments. Our results are
   important for understanding how agricultural matrices act on ant
   communities, and also, how these isolated forest fragments could act as
   an island of biodiversity in an `ocean of crops'.}},

Title = {{The effect of abandonment on vegetation composition and soil properties
   in Molinion meadows (SW Poland)}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{Intermittently wet meadows of the Molinion alliance, as with many other
   grasslands of high nature value, have become increasingly exposed to
   abandonment due to their low economic value. The potential consequences
   of land abandonment are the decrease in species diversity and
   environmental alterations. The issue of land-use induced changes in
   plant species composition and soil physico-chemical parameters have been
   rarely studied in species-rich intermittently wet grasslands. In this
   study we attempt to i) to identify determinants of plant species
   composition patterns and ii) to investigate the effect of cessation of
   mowing on vegetation composition and soil properties. The study was
   conducted in an area of 36 ha covered with Molinion meadows, comprising
   of mown sites and sites that were left unmown for 10 years. In total,
   120 and 80 vegetation plots were sampled from mown and unmown sites,
   respectively. In these plots we measured plant community composition and
   soil physicochemical parameters. The results have shown that the two
   groups of variables (soil properties and management) differ considerably
   in their ability to explain variation in plant species data. Soil
   variables explained four-fold more variation in plant species
   composition than management did. The content of soil organic matter,
   moisture, total nitrogen and exchangeable forms of potassium, calcium
   and magnesium were significantly higher in mown than in unmown grassland
   systems. The results revealed that soil organic matter was the component
   of the soil most strongly affected by management, followed by moisture,
   magnesium, calcium and potassium in that order. Each of these soil
   parameters was negatively correlated with the abundances of woody plants
   and invasive species. We concluded that low intensity, late time of
   mowing is suitable grassland management practice to ensure high plant
   species diversity and sustainability of the grassland ecological system
   while cessation of mowing not only lead to reduced plant species
   richness and diversity, but also to reduced nutrient levels in grassland
   soils.}},

Title = {{Global grass (Poaceae) success underpinned by traits facilitating
   colonization, persistence and habitat transformation}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1125-1144}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Poaceae (the grasses) is arguably the most successful plant family, in
   terms of its global occurrence in (almost) all ecosystems with
   angiosperms, its ecological dominance in many ecosystems, and high
   species richness. We suggest that the success of grasses is best
   understood in context of their capacity to colonize, persist, and
   transform environments (the ``Viking syndrome{''}). This results from
   combining effective long-distance dispersal, efficacious establishment
   biology, ecological flexibility, resilience to disturbance and the
   capacity to modify environments by changing the nature of fire and
   mammalian herbivory. We identify a diverse set of functional traits
   linked to dispersal, establishment and competitive abilities. Enhanced
   long-distance dispersal is determined by anemochory, epizoochory and
   endozoochory and is facilitated via the spikelet (and especially the
   awned lemma) which functions as the dispersal unit. Establishment
   success could be a consequence of the precocious embryo and large starch
   reserves, which may underpin the extremely short generation times in
   grasses. Post-establishment genetic bottlenecks may be mitigated by wind
   pollination and the widespread occurrence of polyploidy, in combination
   with gametic self-incompatibility. The ecological competitiveness of
   grasses is corroborated by their dominance across the range of
   environmental extremes tolerated by angiosperms, facilitated by both C-3
   and C-4 photosynthesis, well-developed frost tolerance in several
   clades, and a sympodial growth form that enabled the evolution of both
   annual and long-lived life forms. Finally, absence of investment in wood
   (except in bamboos), and the presence of persistent buds at or below
   ground level, provides tolerance of repeated defoliation (whether by
   fire, frost, drought or herbivores). Biotic modification of environments
   via feedbacks with herbivory or fire reinforce grass dominance leading
   to open ecosystems. Grasses can be both palatable and productive,
   fostering high biomass and diversity of mammalian herbivores. Many
   grasses have a suite of architectural and functional traits that
   facilitate frequent fire, including a tufted growth form, and
   tannin-like substances in leaves which slow decomposition. We mapped
   these traits over the phylogeny of the Poales, spanning the grasses and
   their relatives, and demonstrated the accumulation of traits since
   monocots originated in the mid-Cretaceous. Although the sympodial growth
   form is a monocot trait, tillering resulting in the tufted growth form
   most likely evolved within the grasses. Similarly, although an ovary
   apparently constructed of a single carpel evolved in the most recent
   grass ancestor, spikelets and the awned lemma dispersal units evolved
   within the grasses. Frost tolerance and C-4 photosynthesis evolved
   relatively late (late Palaeogene), and the last significant trait to
   evolve was probably the production of tannins, associated with
   pyrophytic savannas. This fits palaeobotanical data, suggesting several
   phases in the grass success story: from a late Cretaceous origin, to
   occasional tropical grassland patches in the later Palaeogene, to
   extensive C-3 grassy woodlands in the early-middle Miocene, to the
   dramatic expansion of the tropical C-4 grass savannas and grasslands in
   the Pliocene, and the C-3 steppe grasslands during the Pleistocene
   glacial periods. Modern grasslands depend heavily on strongly seasonal
   climates, making them sensitive to climate change.}},

Title = {{Spatial Pattern and Population Structure of Artemisia ordosica Shrub in
   a Desert Grassland under Enclosure, Northwest China}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Enclosure is an effective practice for restoring and rehabilitating the
   degraded grassland ecosystem caused by overgrazing. Shrub species, which
   are dominant in most desert grasslands in arid and semiarid regions,
   have some beneficial ecological functions for grassland restoration.
   However, how the population structure and spatial pattern of the
   Artemisiaordosica shrub changes in a grassland ecosystem under enclosed
   practice is not well understood. This study, conducted in the Mu Us
   desert in northwest China, was designed to measure the A. ordosica
   population according to the chronosequence of enclosure (enclosure
   periods ranged from 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and 25 years),
   contrasting this with an adjacent continuously grazed grassland. The
   results showed that the enclosed grasslands had a higher number of
   individuals of different age classes (seedling, adult, aging, and dead
   group) and greater population coverage, but shrubs had significant lower
   (p < 0.05) crown diameter and height in comparison with those in
   continuously grazed grassland. Further, enclosed grasslands had a
   significantly higher (p < 0.05) Shannon-Wiener index (H) and Evenness
   index (E), but a significantly lower (p < 0.05) Richness index (R) than
   continuously grazed grassland. The crown of A. ordosica showed a
   significant linear positive correlation with height in all plots across
   succession, indicating that it was feasible to analyze the age structure
   by crown. The crown-class distribution structure of the A.ordosica
   population approximated a Gaussian distribution model in all survey
   plots. Within the population, seedling and adult groups exhibited
   aggregated spatial distribution at small scales, while aging and dead A.
   ordosica groups showed random distribution at almost all scales in
   different plots. The seedling A. ordosica group showed a positive
   correlation with adults at small scales in all plots except in 10 years
   of enclosure. However, it showed independent correlation with aging and
   dead groups at almost all scales. In long-term enclosed plots, the
   mortality rate of the A. ordosica population increased, therefore
   assistance management practices, such as fertilization, mowing, interval
   grazing, and seasonal grazing, must be employed to maintain population
   stability after long-term enclosure. This study can improve
   understanding and clarify the effects of enclosures in the desert
   grasslands of northwest China.}},

   lower than use of unrestored exotic annual grasslands}},

Abstract = {{1. In California's Central Valley, most native grasslands have been
   destroyed or degraded due to invasion, farming and development.
   Grassland restoration is often assumed to provide improved wildlife
   habitat, ostensibly increasing the abundance and diversity of at least
   some native wildlife species relative to unrestored, invaded annual
   grasslands.
   2. We compared rodent, snake and raptor activity and species richness at
   paired unrestored and restored grasslands across four blocked locations
   in the Central Valley using trapping and observational surveys in up to
   four seasons per guild from 2014 to 2015. Restored treatments were
   planted with native perennial grasses 13-24 years prior to study
   initiation but were partially re-invaded by Mediterranean annual grasses
   and forbs. Unrestored treatments contained similar non-native plant
   species assemblages as restored treatments, but did not contain any
   native grass.
   3. Rodent, snake and raptor activity was generally higher in unrestored
   relative to restored treatments. For rodents, the non-native Mus
   musculus (house mouse) showed the greatest disparity in abundance, while
   greater raptors and snakes likely responded to greater rodent abundance.
   4. Within treatments, species-specific rodent responses were related to
   structure of physical vegetation. In particular, Peromyscus maniculatus
   (native deer mouse) was associated with more bare ground and shorter
   vegetation, while the house mouse was associated with less bare ground
   and taller vegetation, regardless of treatment type. Substantial changes
   in rodent species composition were observed over short periods of time
   (< 3 months) after unplanned manipulation of vegetation structure via
   livestock grazing, with patterns reflecting the species-specific
   response to physical vegetation structure.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that while grassland
   restoration may promote persistence of native plant communities,
   restoration may not be beneficial to some higher trophic levels, and in
   fact may reduce habitat value for some native predators in grasslands
   invaded by Mediterranean plant species. Changes in vegetation structure
   can strongly impact wildlife species composition, suggesting a more
   nuanced approach is required for the restoration of desired wildlife
   communities. Thus, species-specific goals should be carefully considered
   to ensure improved alignment of restoration methods with expected
   restoration outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{This study assesses the economic value of land use changes in the
   Zarandul de Est (Romania) Natura 2000 site, applying the ecosystem
   services approach proposed by the TESSA toolkit The aim is to provide
   support to decision-making in the context of high nature value farming,
   debating the contribution of public subsidies and agri-environmental
   schemes to farmers' income Local and global agroforestry ecosystem
   services are compared under two different land use scenarios: 1) land
   abandonment followed by natural afforestation, 2) sustainable cattle
   grazing in semi-natural grasslands. The scenario analysis shows that an
   improved use of pasture land determines a relevant increase in net
   economic value However, direct and rural agro-environmental payments
   applied to high value nature farming are necessary to provide viable
   financial support to farmers and achieve the economic impacts described
   by the ecosystem services approach Under the 2007-2013 rules, Common
   Agricultural Policy payments show to be equal to 130\% of the household
   income and able to cover the full cost of the average farm in Zarand, a
   figure similar to other European marginalised areas This result suggests
   that public support, in the absence of a full implementation of payment
   for ecosystem services schemes, is necessary to limit socio-economic
   deprivation of European marginalised farming systems However, without
   reaching smallholders (farmers holding < lha) and commoners (farmers
   using common grassland) who are both currently excluded, the current
   state agricultural payments shows limited impacts in sustaining the
   resiliency of the Zarand socio-ecological system As alternatives to CAP
   payments, income diversification strategies (e.g. eco- tourism,
   incentives to re-wilding) are proposed as well as the required
   conditions under which they can be applied, and in what terms these
   strategies can sustain the strict requirements of halting biodiversity
   loss in Natura 2000 sites.}},

Abstract = {{Embraced for decision-making, resilience has evolved as a meaningful
   term in areas such as ecology, the economy and society. After a policy
   of grassland contracts was implemented on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,
   two grassland management patterns evolved: the multi-household
   management pattern (MMP) and the single-household management pattern
   (SMP). Within a resilience-driven perspective, this study compared the
   outcomes of these grassland management patterns by measuring their
   effects on the resilience of grazing, ecological, economic and social
   systems. Resilience indicators for each of the four systems were:
   grazing system (grazing space, transhumance, water source and
   reproduction); ecological system (vegetation including cover, biomass,
   species richness and soil properties including pH, organic carbon, total
   nitrogen and total phosphorus); economic system (income, expenditure and
   infrastructure) and the social system (health, assistance, social
   relations, cultural inheritance and institutional arrangements). In
   order to provide a social-ecological resilience framework for the two
   grassland management patterns, a decision support tool was applied to
   approximately gauge the resilience of each indicator. The results showed
   that each of the four systems under the MMP had a greater degree of
   resilience than the SMP, and that the overall resilience of the MMP was
   estimated at 5.8 units compared to about - 5.8 units for the SMP. The
   relative success of the MMP was seen to rest largely on the maintenance
   of traditional management practices, social networks, trust and the low
   cost and high efficiency of informal institutions, which acted to reduce
   the risk of unsustainable development of ecological and social systems.
   The important take-home lesson from this study is that contracting of
   grasslands to private entities on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, and in
   the rest of the world where similar land management practices exist,
   must be undertaken with caution.}},

Abstract = {{Regulation of plant biomass accumulation is a key issue in effective
   grassland conservation in Europe. Burning is an alternative tool to
   regulate biomass dynamics in semi-natural grasslands even in the absence
   of grazing or mowing. We tested the effects of regular spring burning on
   the biomass fractions and fine-scale plant species composition of
   species-rich foothill grasslands in North-Hungary. There were five
   regularly burned and five control grasslands in the study; we collected
   twenty 20 x 20-cm sized biomass samples from each. We analyzed the main
   fractions (litter, graminoid and forb biomass), and the species-level
   biomass scores, and flowering success in the control and burned
   grasslands. We revealed that fire increased the amount of forb biomass
   and decreased the amount of litter, which suggested that regular burning
   might be feasible for regulating biomass dynamics. The non-metric
   multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS) showed a high similarity of the control
   and burned grasslands in species composition. However, plant diversity,
   and the number of flowering shoots decreased significantly in the burned
   grasslands. In regularly burned sites we found a significant decline of
   specialist species, as well as of steppic flora elements. Our results
   showed that besides its positive effect on biomass dynamics,
   high-frequency burning threatens the overall diversity and specialist
   plant species in semi-natural grasslands. We recommend that proper fire
   regimes should be first studied experimentally, to provide a scientific
   basis for the application of prescribed burning management in such
   habitats. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The main objective of this paper is to report habitat occupancy,
   naturalness status and phenology of Urocoras longispinus (Chyzer and
   KulczyA{''}ski 1897), a little-known spider species. Sampling was
   conducted in Natura 2000 habitats of the Matra Mountains, and four
   disturbed mainroad verges in Hungary between 2012 and 2015. We recorded
   356 adult specimens active throughout the year, but abundance was
   highest in autumn. In the Matra Mountains shrub removal negatively
   affected the abundance of U. lonsgspinus: the species preferred shaded
   habitats. The intensity of mowing maintenance caused changes in the
   species' abundance in mainroad verges: the number of individual spiders
   increased as a result of both without maintenance and enhanced
   maintenance. We conclude that U. longispinus is a stenochronous spider
   species which lives in both human-disturbed and undisturbed habitats.
   However, the nature of the disturbance influenced the abundance of this
   species to varying degrees.}},

Abstract = {{Already Darwin encountered the paradox of primitive life forms: they
   co-exist with more complex organisms and do not seem to be less adapted
   to their environment than the latter. In the 20th century, a few more
   paradoxes have been discovered: the paradox of the plankton, of a
   meadow, of the tropical forest and, finally, the paradox of genetic
   diversity. Researchers were uncertain what forces maintain diversity of
   genotypes and species. The main purpose of this article is to summarise
   the attempts to resolve these paradoxes.
   The conclusion is that these paradoxes were caused by overestimation of
   the importance of antagonistic relationships. The fact that the
   ``struggle for existence{''} on population and community levels is
   counterbalanced by interdependence of comparable strength and
   significance has been largely ignored. The latter is understood as
   dependence on living resources, direct and indirect mutualism,
   intraspecific cooperation, complementarity of genotypes in polymorphic
   populations and of species in guilds. The paradox of primitive forms has
   been resolved with the discovery that most of them not only do not
   compete with highly organized beings but are involved in indirect
   mutualism with them. The greatest challenge is to explain the
   coexistence of plant species, especially in tropical communities.
   Nonetheless, some insight has been gained even there. There is a broad
   agreement that diversity of species and genotypes is self-maintaining
   due to the differentiation of niches and numerous negative feedback
   links. Besides, the variability of abiotic conditions, both in space and
   in time, creates a huge diversity of niches and subniches for species
   and genotypes.
   Yet another direction of research is to find out the role that
   biodiversity plays in adjusting to changing environmental conditions
   observed in everyday life. Empirical data suggest that biodiversity has
   the potential to stabilize productivity and aggregate biomass of
   populations and communities. In addition, it increases the efficiency of
   resource utilization resulting in higher total biomass. These
   achievements are developed further within the framework of the general
   adaptation theory. The theory focuses on the adjustment of optima to
   changing environmental conditions and on the corresponding interactions
   of various types of biodiversity, including macromolecules, metabolic
   pathways, genotypes and species. According to this theory, individual
   mechanisms of adaptation contribute to those at the population level,
   while the latter, in turn, represent part of biocenotic mechanisms. It
   is concluded that only a part of the available macromolecules, metabolic
   pathways, genotypes and species are actively engaged in supporting
   certain functions at a particular point in time or space. The rest of
   them remain as a kind of reserve, that can be activated whenever
   appropriate environmental conditions recur. In connection with that,
   another question addressed is why life on Earth has chosen this
   particular type of organization characterised by strong integration of
   parts at the lower levels of structural hierarchy and weak at the higher
   levels. The most acceptable answer might be this: strong integration at
   all levels would turn ecological communities into real superorganisms,
   allowing life to function more efficiently, but would undoubtedly
   undermine its adaptability so necessary for living in a constantly
   changing environment.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{5008-5015}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous disturbance patterns are fundamental to rangeland
   conservation and management because heterogeneity creates patchy
   vegetation, broadens niche availability, increases compositional
   dissimilarity, and enhances temporal stability of aboveground biomass
   production. Pyrodiversity is a popular concept for how variability in
   fire as an ecological disturbance can enhance heterogeneity, but
   mechanistic understanding of factors that drive heterogeneity is
   lacking. Mesic grasslands are examples of ecosystems in which
   pyrodiversity is linked strongly to broad ecological processes such as
   trophic interactions because grazers are attracted to recently burned
   areas, creating a unique ecological disturbance referred to as the
   fire-grazing interaction, or pyric herbivory. But several questions
   about the application of pyric herbivory remain: What proportion of a
   grazed landscape must burn, or how many patches are required, to create
   sufficient spatial heterogeneity and reduce temporal variability? How
   frequently should patches burn? Does season of fire matter? To bring
   theory into applied practice, we studied a gradient of grazed tallgrass
   prairie landscapes created by different sizes, seasons, and frequencies
   of fire, and used analyses sensitive to nonlinear trends. The greatest
   spatial heterogeneity and lowest temporal variability in aboveground
   plant biomass, and greatest plant functional group beta diversity,
   occurred in landscapes with three to four patches (25\%-33\% of area
   burned) and three- to four-year fire return intervals. Beta diversity
   had a positive association with spatial heterogeneity and negative
   relationship with temporal variability. Rather than prescribing that
   these results constitute best management practices, we emphasize the
   flexibility offered by interactions between patch number and fire
   frequency for matching rangeland productivity and offtake to specific
   management goals. As we observed no differences across season of fire,
   we recommend future research focus on fire frequency within a moderate
   proportion of the landscape burned, and consider a wider seasonal burn
   window.}},

Abstract = {{Species-rich semi-natural grasslands in Europe are a main target for
   conservation efforts, and alternative methods to the traditional
   management of mowing or grazing would be welcome due to the difficulties
   in maintaining traditional management practices. One such method
   proposed is burning of grassland vegetation during late winter or
   spring. To evaluate the effects of annual spring burning vs annual
   mowing on semi-natural grassland vegetation, we compared the frequency
   of species in eleven field experiments in southern Sweden after ca 14
   years. Out of the 88 species analyzed, five were more frequent in burnt
   plots compared with mowed plots (Vicia cracca, Cirsium arvense, Urtica
   dioica, Galium verum, Convallaria majalis). In contrast, 37 species were
   significantly less frequent in burnt plots compared with mowed ones,
   those with the largest differences being Ranunculus acris, Briza media,
   Veronica chamaedrys, Festuca ovina, Plantago lanceolata and Anthoxanthum
   odoratum. Tall-grown species and those with preferences for N-rich soils
   increased in frequency under an annual spring-burn regime, compared with
   annual mowing, as did species producing larger amounts of nectar. Hence,
   although vegetation composition becomes more trivial with annual spring
   burns, there might be long-term benefits for nectar-feeding insects.}},

Title = {{Responses of small mammal communities to environment and agriculture in
   a rural mosaic landscape}},
Journal = {{MAMMALIAN BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{55-65}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Intensification of agriculture is an increasing threat for biodiversity.
   Central Romania still preserves a traditional rural landscape with a
   matrix of small plots of crops and large surfaces covered by grasslands
   and forests, but its biodiversity is very poorly studied. Small mammals
   are key components of agrarian and semi-natural ecosystems but rodents
   are also viewed as major pests. Knowledge of the driving factors of
   small mammal communities in agricultural landscapes may enable taking
   management measures that pursue both conservation and economic goals.
   Here we evaluate the response of small mammals to environmental
   variables, including vegetation characteristics, land use and geographic
   position. We conducted live trapping between June and October in
   habitats with different environmental characteristics and land uses. We
   found that vegetation traits were the most important factors influencing
   small mammal communities. Species composition was shaped mainly by tree
   cover, shrub cover had strong effects on community diversity and
   abundance, while the height of the herbaceous layer significantly
   influenced all the parameters. Among the agrarian land uses maize crops
   stood out for the abundance of mice, especially Mus musculus, and
   hayfields for Microtus arvalis. Land fallowing was linked to the
   increase of diversity and total abundance to the maximum values but did
   not significantly alter species composition. Species with low tolerance
   to tree cover were more prone to be abundant in agricultural lands,
   whereas the habitat generalists prevailed in non-agrarian lands. Our
   results suggest that preservation of the mosaic of farmed and
   semi-natural habitats and actions targeted for vegetation management,
   such as interspersing woody vegetation in the crop matrix and mowing the
   herbaceous vegetation in seminatural habitats adjacent to crops, may
   together achieve the balance between biodiversity conservation and crop
   protection. (C) 2018 Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Saugetierkunde. Published

Abstract = {{In grasslands across the world, woody species are replacing grass cover.
   This bush encroachment can alter available food, cover, and space
   resources for most mammalian species; however, the specific responses of
   mammals to bush encroachment in African savannas remain largely unknown.
   We examined the fine-scale response of mammals across a gradient of bush
   encroachment using camera traps and a Bayesian hierarchical
   multi-species abundance model that estimates local relative abundance
   and species richness while accounting for imperfect detection.
   Additionally, we simulated species-specific relative abundances and
   species richness responses to differing bush encroachment management
   actions. Contrary to our expectations, the relative abundance of only
   one species showed a negative relationship to shrub cover and another to
   tree cover. However, the relative abundance of eight out of twenty-one
   species showed a positive association with grass cover. Mammal species
   richness increased with grass cover, decreased with shrub cover, and
   showed no clear pattern with increasing tree cover. Furthermore, our
   simulations suggest reducing and increasing shrub and grass cover
   respectively by 50\% would increase species richness and local
   abundances for the mammal community of the area. Our results indicate
   grass cover exerts a strong influence on habitat use, relative
   abundances and species richness in bush encroached areas. Our study
   shows that mammal's positive response to grass cover is more important
   than potential negative impacts of increasing shrub cover. Consequently,
   recovering and maintaining adequate grass cover in savannas subject to
   bush encroachment is an indispensable condition to maximize mammalian
   diversity and abundances.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of predictions about the impacts of climate change on
   wildlife have relied either on the study of species' physiological
   tolerance or on broad-scale distribution models. In comparison, little
   attention has been paid to species' mechanistic responses to
   fine-grained, climate-induced modifications of habitat suitability.
   However, such studies would be pivotal to the understanding of species'
   ecological requirements (and hence their adaptive potential to
   environmental change) and the design of management strategies. We
   investigated foraging microhabitat selection in a potentially
   climate-change sensitive species, the white-winged snowfinch
   Monafringilla nivalis, during the breeding season in the Alps. Our
   microhabitat selection model considered topography, ground-cover
   variables and sward height within a 5-m radius at foraging and control
   locations. Habitat selection was positively affected by grassland cover,
   negatively by sward height and quadratically by snow cover (optimum
   around 40\%); birds avoided anthropized (urban areas, roads) sites. We
   estimated past (1976) and future (2066) climate-driven changes in
   foraging microhabitat suitability, assuming a progressively earlier date
   of snowmelt due to increasing temperatures over this entire time span.
   We then modelled the potential impact of snowmelt (and related sward
   height) on habitat suitability under two scenarios: maintaining the
   current situation (i.e. irregular seasonal grazing) and implementing
   targeted management in an attempt to mitigate impacts of earlier
   snowmelt. Predicted foraging habitat suitability (estimated as the
   fraction of suitable plots) significantly declined over time (-23\%
   between 1976 and 2016, further 32\% loss by 2066). However, model
   outputs demonstrated that maintaining sward height below 6 cm on
   breeding grounds (e.g. by regular grazing) would significantly decrease
   the predicted loss of suitable foraging habitat. Detailed information
   about patterns of resource exploitation allows the identification of
   mechanistic, functional responses of species to environmental change,
   and enables an evaluation of habitat management options that can buffer
   against the detrimental effects of global warming.}},

Abstract = {{Ecosystem engineers play an important role in resource availability and
   can be negatively impacted by anthropogenic disturbances, such as
   livestock grazing. The decline of digging and burrowing mammals in
   Australia is partly attributed to agriculture, however little is known
   about their use of microhabitats, and thus, how they respond to
   different cattle grazing regimes. Here, we examine the response of a
   marsupial ecosystem engineer, the rufous bettong (Aepyprymnus rufescens)
   to cattle grazing strategies and vegetation types, and examine whether
   microhabitat selection is driving this response. We hypothesized that
   rufous bettongs would be negatively impacted by heavy cattle grazing due
   to their use of ground-level microhabitat features. We conducted a
   mark-recapture trapping survey among four grazing treatments and in two
   vegetation types (box and ironbark woodlands), at a 20-year grazing
   trial in northern Australia. We modelled rufous bettong abundance in
   response to grazing treatment and vegetation type and determined
   microhabitat preference using Manly selection ratios. We found that
   rufous bettongs preferred ironbark and avoided heavy grazing. Thus, they
   avoided the areas of highest cattle utilization. On average, individuals
   preferred high grass and other terrestrial microhabitat variables of
   moderate complexity. Our results indicate that habitat selection is
   contributing to the response of a marsupial ecosystem engineer to
   different grazing strategies. Mammalian digging and burrowing ecosystem
   engineers should be a conservation focus on rangelands due to their
   positive influence on a suite of species, and their ability to
   potentially mitigate some of the negative impacts of cattle grazing on
   soil health.}},

Abstract = {{1. The increasing availability of high resolution and high frequency,
   radar-based remote sensing data (i.e. observations on land surface
   characteristics, insensitive to cloud interference), makes it possible
   to track land-use intensity more precisely at the whole landscape scale.
   2. Here, we develop a new radar-based remote sensing technique for
   large-scale quantification of agricultural land-use intensity across
   human-dominated landscapes. We compare the respective abilities of
   Sentinel-1 C-band radar (C-SAR, C-band synthetic aperture radar) remote
   sensing data with the more traditional optical data, as MODIS enhanced
   vegetation indices (MODIS EVI), in capturing seasonality and the
   magnitude of land-use intensity (quantity and frequency of biomass
   removal). Linking our novel radar-based change detection algorithm to
   agricultural management activities on the ground, we quantify a whole
   landscape according to timing of mowing, a key grassland disturbance,
   thus capturing the dynamics of mowing regimes in grasslands.
   3. We found that the radar-based proxy provides a rapid and reliable
   measure of land-use intensity, reliably predicting plant community
   composition at the landscape scale.
   4. We tested this methodology using data on black-tailed godwits (Limosa
   limosa limosa), a specialist breeder of lowland meadows which, over the
   last 50years, has shown dramatic declines. During territory
   establishment, black-tailed godwits preferentially used fields
   corresponding to intermediate radar-sensed land-use intensities.
   However, the present-day timing of mowing in these habitats was such
   that most godwit broods were less likely to be successful than broods in
   grasslands used at a lower intensity.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The newly developed radar-based land-use
   intensity quantification is a powerful tool that makes it possible for
   ecologists and land managers to include agricultural land-use intensity
   measurements in population studies of the plants, insects, birds and
   mammals using these landscapes, at the spatial scale of entire
   populations. Applications of this tool include evaluating the
   effectiveness of European agri-environment schemes aiming to increase
   biodiversity through decreased land-use intensity or expanding the
   quantification of agricultural land-use intensity to other geographic
   regions.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are often managed with different intensities in the European
   Alps. Studies have shown that a medium management can benefit plant and
   animal biodiversity in these ecosystems. However, in recent decades
   abandonment of extensively managed meadows is an ongoing global
   challenge. Syrphids (hoverflies) have been recognized as a threatened
   group due to environmental drivers, and these managed grasslands provide
   preferred habitats for them. Yet, at what extent syrphids respond to
   grassland management strategies is little known. We investigated whether
   abandonment of managed mountain meadows (mown once a year, no fertilizer
   use) affects syrphid abundance, richness and species assemblages.
   Moreover, the influence of plant richness, flower frequency and
   surrounding landscape on syrphids were assessed. Four managed meadows
   were compared with four abandoned meadows in a mountainous region in
   Austria. Adult syrphids were sampled over two consecutive years (June
   and August 2015-2016) by sweep netting using line transects and
   observation plots. Syrphid abundance was significantly higher in managed
   than abandoned meadows and increased with increasing plant richness and
   flower frequency across management types. Management and sampling time
   also significantly affected syrphid species assemblages. Syrphid
   richness and abundance were not influenced by surrounding landscape. We
   conclude that both abandoned and managed meadows provide important
   habitat types for syrphids. Therefore, efforts should be made to
   maintain both managed and abandoned meadows in order to protect syrphid
   species within mountainous landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Decapod assemblages associated with algal fronds and the underlying
   substratum in two different photophilous macroalgal beds dominated by
   the brown algae Halopteris scoparia were studied in the northwestern
   Alboran Sea, between July 2007 and April 2008. A total of 35 decapod
   species were found in the macroalgal beds, most of them inhabiting both
   strata and with Hippolyte leptocerus, Pilumnus hirtellus, Sirpus
   zariquieyi, Acanthonyx lunulotus, Athanas nitescens and Achaeus gracilis
   as the dominant species. Assemblages on algal fronds and sediment
   displayed significant variations mainly due to differences in the
   abundance values of some dominant species (e.g. H. leptocerus) and/or
   the presence of certain species exclusively in one strata (e.g. Pisa
   nodipes in algal fronds, Atelecyclus rotundatus and Sicyonia carinata on
   the sediment stratum). Higher abundance, species richness and
   Shannon-Wiener diversity index values were registered in the sediment
   stratum, with a higher contribution of adults-large individuals than of
   juvenile-small individuals. The temporal variability of the studied
   assemblages showed maximum abundance values in November, when algal
   development is minimal. This decoupling between temporal patterns of
   decapod assemblages and macroalgal dynamic could be related to the
   lifestyles (recruitment events, movements of species between adjacent
   habitats and microhabitats) and trophic guilds of dominant species, fish
   predation pressure and the structural complexity of the habitat. A
   similar trophic structure was observed for both strata, however there
   was a predominance of grazers in the algae stratum and of predators and
   scavengers in the sediment stratum. The high diversity and abundance of
   predator decapods, the relatively balanced distribution of most trophic
   groups, and the overall high values of species richness and evenness,
   could indicate a healthy status of at least two of the eleven ``Good
   Environmental Status{''} indicators (biodiversity and food webs) during
   the study period, according to the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.}},

Title = {{Manipulating ungulate herbivory in temperate and boreal forests: effects
   on vegetation and invertebrates. A systematic review}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL EVIDENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{APR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Livestock grazing and `overabundance' of large wild
   herbivores in forested areas have long been perceived as conflicting
   with the aims of both silviculture and forest conservation; however,
   certain kinds of herbivory can help to maintain habitat values in forest
   ecosystems. Management of mammalian herbivory in protected forests can,
   therefore, be a critical tool for biodiversity conservation. The primary
   aim of this systematic review was to examine how forest vegetation and
   invertebrates are affected by manipulation of the grazing/browsing
   pressure by livestock or wild ungulates. The ultimate purpose was to
   investigate whether such manipulation is useful for conserving or
   restoring biodiversity in forest set-asides.
   Methods: We considered studies of manipulated ungulate herbivory in
   forests anywhere within the boreal and temperate zones, not only in
   protected areas but also in production forest. Non-intervention or
   alternative levels of intervention were used as comparators. Relevant
   outcomes included abundance, diversity and composition of plants and
   invertebrates, tree regeneration, and performance of focal/target
   species. Studies were mainly selected from a recent systematic map of
   the evidence on biodiversity effects of forest management relevant to
   protected areas. Additional studies were identified through updated
   searches online and in bibliographies of existing reviews. Relevant
   studies were critically appraised, and studies with low or unclear
   validity were excluded from the review. Quantitative outcomes were
   extracted from 103 articles, and summary effect sizes were derived by
   meta-analysis.
   Results: Most of the 144 studies included in the review had been
   conducted in North America, Europe or Australia/New Zealand. The
   intervention most commonly studied was experimental exclusion (or
   enclosure) of wild and/or domestic ungulates by fencing. Other studies
   examined culling of wild ungulates or compared forests long grazed by
   livestock to ungrazed forests. Effects on vegetation and invertebrates
   were reported in 135 and 23 of the studies, respectively. We found
   negative responses to herbivory in the abundance of understorey
   vegetation as a whole, woody understorey and bryophytes, and also in the
   species richness of woody understorey vegetation, whereas the richness
   of forbs and bryophytes responded positively. Several effects depended
   on ungulate origins: Understorey abundance responded negatively to
   livestock and to ungulates introduced into the wild, but not to native
   ones. In contrast, understorey species richness responded positively to
   livestock but not to wild ungulates. The duration and intensity of
   herbivory had few significant effects on vegetation-exceptions included
   woody understorey abundance and richness, which decreased with
   increasing duration and intensity, respectively. Among invertebrates we
   found negative responses to herbivory in the abundance of lepidopterans
   and spiders, but no significant effects on species richness.
   Conclusions: Our review revealed a large body of high-validity
   experimental studies on impacts of ungulate herbivory in forests. This
   evidence confirmed that manipulation of such herbivory is often highly
   influential on tree regeneration and on the abundance, diversity and
   composition of understorey vegetation. Nevertheless, we also identified
   important knowledge gaps-we found few studies of boreal areas, long-term
   herbivory effects, impacts on bryophytes, lichens and invertebrates, and
   effects of manipulation less radical than total exclusion of ungulates.}},

Title = {{Modelling vegetation dynamics in managed grasslands: Responses to
   drivers depend on species richness}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},

Volume = {{374}},

Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{In mathematical grassland models, plant communities may be represented
   by a various number of state variables, describing biomass compartments
   of some dominant species or plant functional types. The size of the
   initial species pool could have consequences on the outcome of the
   simulated ecosystem dynamics in terms of grassland productivity,
   diversity, and stability. This choice could also influence the model
   sensitivity to forcing parameters.
   To address these issues, we developed a dynamic grassland model,
   DynaGraM, designed to simulate seasonal changes in both aboveground
   biomass production and species composition of managed permanent
   grasslands under various soil, climate and management conditions. We
   compared simulation results from alternative instances of DynaGraM that
   only differ by the identity and number of state variables describing the
   green biomass, here plant species. We assessed the sensitivity of each
   instance of the model to key forcing parameters for climate, soil
   fertility, and defoliation disturbances, using univariate and
   multivariate regression trees and dynamic trees.
   Results of 10-year simulations under various climate, fertility and
   defoliation conditions showed that the final total biomass was tending
   to increase with the size of the species pool, while species evenness
   and the proportion of surviving species was tending to decrease. We
   found a positive correlation between the species survival ratio and the
   defoliation intensity, and this correlation increased with the initial
   species richness. The sensitivity to forcing parameters of community
   structure and species evenness differed markedly among alternative
   models, showing a progressive shift from high importance of soil
   fertility (fertilisation level, mineralization rate) to high importance
   of defoliation (mowing frequency, grazing intensity) as the size of the
   species pool increased. By contrast, the key drivers of total biomass
   production were independent of species richness and only linked to
   resource supply (nitrogen and water).
   These results highlight the need to take into account the role of
   species diversity to explain the behaviour of grassland models.}},

Title = {{Trees are all around us: Farmers' management of wood pastures in the
   light of a controversial policy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{212}},
Pages = {{228-235}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Wood pastures are some of the most species-rich environments found in
   Europe and therefore essential habitats for biodiversity conservation.
   Society also puts faith in multiple values of trees, ranging from
   climate change mitigation to socio-cultural traditions. Therefore, the
   seemingly arbitrary tree density limit for pasture environments imposed
   by the EU through its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) threatened both
   biological and societal values. In this study on farmers' perspectives,
   we target the effects of the CAP tree density limit on management of
   wood pastures in a low-intensively managed agricultural landscape of
   southern Sweden. The case of simplifying nature by using simple number
   limitations was used as an entry point in semi-structured, open-ended,
   interviews with farmers and officials about their view on trees and
   pasture management in relation to policy directives. The interviews
   showed that the policy incentive shifted the management focus from
   grazing quality to the number of trees and that farmers are willing to
   cut in order to get subsidies and timber revenues, however not
   unreflectingly. Farmers had high knowledge about the wide ranging
   social, cultural and natural values of trees, and are often themselves
   as good regulators of tree management as policies intend to be. Our
   study reveals many difficulties in managing the complex relations within
   landscapes with simplified legal measures, opening up for further
   discussion about improving policy instruments to preserve both social
   and biological values of wood pastures. However, although the tree
   density limit has been criticised on many points related to biodiversity
   conservation, this study shows that other values linked to pasture
   trees, e.g. the aesthetic values and their importance as shelter for
   grazing animals, could be an argument to actually keep the focus on
   trees as indicators of pasture management quality. We suggest that trees
   in general and wood-pastures in particular therefore are good starting
   points, or boundary-objects, for collaboration between production and
   conservation interests of farming and environmental management. (C) 2018

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-65}},
Month = {{APR 13}},
Abstract = {{Land use change can affect biodiversity, and this has an impact on
   ecosystem services (ESs), but the relationships between biodiversity and
   ESs are complex and poorly understood. Biodiversity is declining due to
   the abandonment of extensively grazed semi-natural grasslands.
   We therefore aim to explore relationships between biodiversity and ESs
   provided by extensively managed semi-natural grasslands. Focusing on
   vascular plant species richness, as well as the ESs fodder quantity,
   quality, and stability, allergy control, climate regulation, nutrient
   cycling, pollination, and aesthetic appreciation, we carried out
   botanical field surveys of 28 paired extensively grazed and abandoned
   semi-natural grassland plots, with four subplots of 4m(2) in each plot.
   The management of the semi-natural grasslands is and has been at low
   intensity. We calculated the influence of abandonment on the ES
   indicators, measured the correlation between the biodiversity measure of
   vascular plant species richness and ES indicators, and finally
   determined how the relationships between plant species richness and the
   ES indicators were affected by the cessation of the extensive
   management.
   ES indicators are often, but not always, positively correlated with
   species richness. Cessation of extensive grazing has both negative and
   positive effects on ES indicators but the relationships between species
   richness and ES indicators are often different in extensively managed
   and abandoned semi-natural grasslands. The relationships between species
   richness and ES indicators are less pronounced in the extensively
   managed semi-natural grassland than for the abandoned. One possible
   reason for this outcome is high functional redundancy in the extensively
   managed semi-natural grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands have been severely affected by agricultural
   land-use change. However, the isostatic land adjustment following
   deglaciation in the Northern Hemisphere means that new land is
   continually being created in coastal areas. We modelled isostatic
   adjustment during the last 4000 years in a region of the Baltic coast to
   estimate the emergence of potential grassland habitat. We also compared
   the alpha and beta diversity of existing managed and abandoned coastal
   meadows, and assessed their contribution to biodiversity at landscape
   scales. We estimated that half the 7866 km(2) of emerging land had the
   potential to become coastal meadow habitat, which is an order of
   magnitude larger than the total area of all valuable semi-natural
   grassland in the study region today. The small area of managed coastal
   habitat remaining was found to have a disproportionate influence on the
   richness of threatened species at landscape scales, but our results also
   show that continued management is essential for the maintenance of
   grassland biodiversity. Our combination of approaches identifies
   uplifted coastal meadows as an additional original niche for grassland
   plant species, while highlighting that low-intensity disturbance through
   grassland management is essential for the maintenance of diversity at
   multiple scales.}},

Abstract = {{To ensure long-term sustainability and ecological resilience of
   agroecosystems, agricultural production should be guided by policies to
   ensure regenerative cropping and grazing management protocols. Changing
   current unsustainable high-input agricultural practices to low-input
   practices that regenerate ecosystem function will be necessary for
   sustainable, resilient agroecosystems. Effective soil management
   provides the greatest potential for achieving sustainable use of
   agricultural land with rapidly changing, uncertain and variable climate.
   With appropriate management of grazing enterprises, soil function can be
   regenerated to improve essential ecosystem services and farm
   profitability. Affected ecosystem services include carbon sequestration,
   water infiltration, soil fertility, nutrient cycling, soil formation,
   biodiversity, wildlife habitat, and increased ecosystem stability and
   resilience. Collectively, conservation agriculture managed
   regeneratively supports ecologically healthy, resilient agroecosystems
   and enhances watershed function. To accomplish this, it is important for
   scientists to partner with farmers who have improved the environment and
   excel financially to convert experimental results into sound
   environmental, social, and economic benefits regionally and globally.
   Benefits include addressing questions at commercial scale; integrating
   component science into whole-system responses; identifying emergent
   properties and unintended consequences; incorporating pro-active
   management to achieve desired goals under changing circumstances; and
   including the potential of the human element to achieve superior
   economic and environmental goals. Developing and implementing
   regenerative management protocols that include ruminant grazing animals
   will be necessary to ensure long-term sustainability and ecological
   resilience of agroecosystems.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Previous studies of Eurasian grasslands have suggested that nutrient
   ratios, rather than absolute nutrient availabilities and associated
   productivity, may be driving plant species richness patterns. However,
   the underlying assumption that species occupy distinct niches along
   nutrient ratio gradients remains to be tested. We analysed plant
   community composition and nutrient status of 644 Eurasian wet grassland
   plots. The importance of nutrient ratios driving variation in species
   composition was analysed using ordination methods (DCA and CCA).
   Subsequently, we assessed the niche position and width along the most
   important nutrient ratio gradient {[}N:P] for each species. We found
   that the N:P ratio explained part of the variation in species
   composition independent from conventional explanatory variables. The N:P
   ratio explained less variation than soil moisture or pH, but more than
   productivity or the availability of N and P separately, highlighting its
   importance for grassland species composition. Species occupied distinct
   niches along the N:P gradient, and species' niche widths decreased
   toward extreme nutrient limitation. After correcting for niche position,
   there was no overall difference in niche width between endangered and
   non-endangered species. Surprisingly, endangered species with niche
   optima at the extreme P-limited end of the gradient had broader niches
   than their non-endangered counterparts. As species occupied distinct
   niches along a nutrient ratio gradient, future grassland conservation
   efforts may benefit from targeting changes in nutrient ratios, i.e. the
   balance between N and P, rather than only focussing on a general
   reduction in nutrient availability. However, what management
   interventions can be used for this purpose remains unclear.}},

Title = {{Influence of land use on the riparian zone condition along an

Journal = {{BOTANICAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{96}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{180-199}},
Month = {{APR-JUN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Riparian vegetation is strongly influenced by the
   surrounding land use. While it is known that urbanization processes can
   affect plant species composition and the ecological condition of the
   riparian zone, the specific responses require a fuller understanding.
   Hypothesis: The quality of riparian zones is inversely related to the
   degree of urbanization of adjacent areas, and that land uses that
   provide forest cover ensure a less degraded condition and greater
   diversity of species.
   Study site and year of study: Sabinal River basin, Chiapas, Mexico,
   2015.
   Methods: Measures of the Riparian Quality Index (RQI) and plant species
   composition were compared among three different land use conditions
   (secondary forest, grasslands and crops, and human settlements).
   Results: Riparian zones adjacent to secondary forest showed higher RQI
   than those next to grasslands and crops and human settlements. Riparian
   zones within secondary forest also had a higher woody species richness
   and better substrate condition, whereas reaches adjacent to human
   settlements appeared paved and eroded, exhibiting soil compaction.
   Species richness and diversity were positively correlated to the RQI and
   were greater in riparian zones adjacent to secondary forest than in
   those next to human settlements.
   Conclusions: While grazing and cultivation affect the riparian zone,
   expansion of urban areas has a greater impact by reducing woody species
   richness and diversity, altering species composition and favoring soil
   compaction and bank erosion, which results in reduced riparian quality.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Expansion of trees into grasslands and old fields is a complex process
   that leads to a decline of biodiversity and reduces rangeland
   availability. Climate and land-use change contribute to accelerated
   rates of range expansion. However, the role of biotic interactions in
   promoting or hindering woody range expanders is still unclear. We
   investigated the combined effects of abiotic (soil properties and
   climate) and biotic (simulated grazing and intra-and interspecific
   plant-plant interactions) factors on a woody rangeexpander, Juniperus
   virginiana, which has been spreading into grasslands and old-field
   habitats in North America. We hypothesized that interspecific
   competition would negatively affect growth and survival of J. virginiana
   due to belowground competition with herbaceous species; grazing would
   favor J. virginiana via competitive release, and intraspecific
   interactions would be beneficial to tree seedlings during early life
   stages by means of facilitation. We also predicted that a thicker winter
   snowpack would have a positive impact on tree growth by providing
   protection from frost damage. In a multisite field experiment, we
   exposed J. virginiana seedlings to intra-and interspecific interactions,
   as well as simulated grazing of surrounding herbaceous species. These
   treatments were repeated at three different sites that vary in soil
   properties and that are situated along a precipitation gradient.
   Additionally, we conducted a snow-manipulation experiment at one of the
   sites. We conducted our monitoring for two consecutive growing seasons
   characterized by very different rainfall conditions, the second growing
   season receiving between 6\% and 14\% more rainfall than the first.
   Under lower rainfall availability, interspecific interactions between
   tree seedlings and herbaceous species negatively affected seedling
   growth rates. However, this effect was detectable only during the drier
   year and at the site characterized by more favorable soil properties.
   During winter, we found that deeper snow cover was associated with
   decreased growth rate of plants, probably due to repeated freeze-thaw
   cycles. Our results indicate that the role of biotic interactions had an
   effect only under harsh climatic conditions and that abiotic factors may
   affect range expansion directly and indirectly via biotic interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Mixed-grazing systems occur when two or more large herbivores graze
   together. Body size and anatomical differences between animal species
   are reflected in differences in their selected diet and foraging
   behaviour, which can bring about opportunities for complementary pasture
   use. The extent to which niche separation occurs within farming systems
   depends on the degree of sward heterogeneity and the scale of the
   resource available, with cultivated swards generally offering
   comparatively little occasion for selective grazing, in comparison to
   native pastures. However, even then there are opportunities for mixed
   grazing to benefit productivity. A range of studies have shown that if
   sheep are grazed together with cattle on simple grass/white clover
   swards, the performance of the sheep is improved in comparison to
   sheep-only grazing, leading to a higher total output per unit area.
   Semi-natural vegetation communities offer much more opportunity for
   selective grazing as they are generally more botanically and
   structurally diverse. Examples are given of the impact of losing large
   and small grazers from grazed ecosystems in marginal areas. Loss of
   cattle grazing from the uplands of Wales has been instrumental in the
   spread of invasive hill grass species linked to the loss of heathland
   habitats of international conservation importance. Conversely, the loss
   of sheep and goats from common lands in the Cantabrian Mountains has led
   to the progressive expansion of woody vegetation, again at the expense
   of heathlands. Such examples highlight the role that mixed grazing can
   play in promoting economic and environmental sustainability,
   particularly in marginal areas.}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Sub-alpine grassland ecosystems have some of the highest
   biodiversity in Europe and constitute high-value natural resources.
   These grasslands are under threat because of the abandonment of
   traditional agro-pastoral activities and subsequent invasion by woody
   species. In the Central Pyrenees (Spain) several management techniques
   have been used to stop expansion of the highly encroaching shrub
   Echinospartum horridum. However, the ways in which these techniques
   affect recovery of sub-alpine grasslands are poorly understood. The
   final goal of this study is to gain information about the effects of E.
   horridum management practices and provide recommendations for the local
   stakeholders.
   Methods: This study evaluated the efficacy of controlled fires and
   mechanical removal of above-ground vegetation in controlling expansion
   of E. horridum into sub-alpine grasslands in the Central Pyrenees. E.
   horridum demography (germination and survival), soil seed bank and soil
   properties were recorded in two E. horridum stands where vegetation was
   previously removed by (1) fire (burning treatment) or (2) mechanical
   removal (cutting treatment) and (3) an undisturbed E. horridum stand
   (control).
   Results: The burning treatment increased germination and survival of
   E.horridum seedlings more than the cutting treatment, relative to the
   control. Therefore, cutting appeared to be a better option for
   controlling E. horridum. Soil seed density was higher in the management
   treatments than in the control, but it did not harbour sub-alpine
   grasslands species. E. horridum removal favoured recharge of the soil
   with seeds that arrived by dispersal. The soil seed bank in the burning
   treatment had higher seed abundance and seed diversity than in the
   cutting treatment; however, fire promoted a loss of soil nutrients.
   Conclusions: The soil seed bank composition (low abundance and diversity
   of native species) coupled with rapid regeneration rate of E. horridum
   would prevent recovery of the sub-alpine grassland based on the soil
   seed bank alone. Traditional shepherding has been reported to favour
   seed dispersal, and here we recommend E. horridum removal with cutting
   treatment as an additional practice for integrated management and
   recovery of the sub-alpine grasslands.}},

Title = {{Annual mowing maintains plant diversity in threatened temperate
   grasslands}},

Volume = {{21}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Questions: Disturbance regimes shaped the evolution of grasslands but
   grazing exclusion and fire suppression have caused unprecedented
   increases in grassland biomass and biodiversity declines. Mowing reduces
   biomass but is not widely practiced in conservation reserves because of
   concerns about facilitating exotic plant invasion and altering ecosystem
   function. We asked whether regular mowing affected (1) the diversity of
   native and exotic functional groups, (2) spatial turnover in vegetation
   composition (beta-diversity), (3) vegetation attributes relating to
   biomass and structural heterogeneity, (4) community composition and (5)
   the distribution and abundance of individual native and exotic species.
   Location: Five temperate grassland reserves, south-eastern Australia,
   encompassing C-3 and C-4 dominated communities.
   Methods: Vegetation within reserves had been cut to 10 cm, once per
   year, for 10 years in late spring/early summer to maintain access
   tracks. We surveyed plant communities in mowed areas and nearby (<5 m)
   unmowed control areas (40 subplots per reserve, 200 total) and used
   linear mixed-effects models to examine the effects of mowing.
   Results: Of 24 functional groups, the richness of 16 native and exotic
   groups significantly increased with mowing. In 14 of these cases,
   effects were consistent across C-3- and C-4-dominated grassland. Mowing
   reduced spatial turnover, but this did not reduce species richness at
   any spatial scale. When accounting for species abundance and evenness
   (Shannon diversity), effects of mowing were generally positive for
   native species and neutral for exotic species. Mowing increased native
   perennial grass cover and bare earth, decreased exotic perennial grass
   cover and litter, and changed community composition. Mowing reduced
   vegetation height but not structural heterogeneity. Mowing positively
   affected six individual native species and no exotic species. One native
   (Asperula conferta) and two exotic (Avena spp. and Nassella neesiana)
   species were found in lower abundance on mowed plots.
   Conclusions: Annual mowing can be a useful conservation tool for
   threatened temperate grasslands but should be heterogeneous to ensure
   the persistence of mowing-sensitive native species. Good vehicle hygiene
   is essential and localized complementary management (e.g., herbicide)
   might be required to reduce exotic forbs and grasses.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: How do seeding, cattle grazing, and vehicular use impact
   vegetation establishment and soil movement on a newly reclaimed pipeline
   right-of-way? Will these factors result in differing plant community
   trajectories?
   Location: Southern Arizona (USA).
   Methods: Within a pipeline disturbance, we randomly selected nine plots
   to be seeded with an 18 species mix and nine to be left unseeded.
   Adjacent to the disturbance, we selected nine undisturbed unseeded
   control plots for a total of 27 plots (30 m x 45 m each). Within each of
   the 27 plots, we established a grazed-trampled, grazed-untrampled and
   ungrazed-untrampled subplot. One year after pipeline reclamation, we
   analysed the impacts of seeding, grazing and trampling on native plant
   cover, undesirable plant cover, herbaceous biomass, species richness,
   soil movement and plant community trajectories in comparison to
   surrounding undisturbed sites.
   Result: Seeding disturbed sites with a diverse seed mix resulted in
   greater native plant cover, higher species richness and fewer
   undesirable species than were found in unseeded disturbed sites.
   Unseeded disturbed areas were similar to the undisturbed control areas
   in species richness and had comparable plant community trajectories. The
   combined impacts of grazing and trampling reduced native plant cover and
   herbaceous biomass and were associated with increased soil erosion in
   comparison to subplots protected from grazing and trampling.
   Conclusions: Natural vegetation recruitment can be a viable option in
   semi-arid reclamation projects when the soil seed bank is preserved and
   there are proximal seed sources. While seeding improved quantitative
   vegetation metrics, using a seed mix comprised of different species than
   the preexisting vegetation may set the reclaimed vegetation on a
   different plant community trajectory. The general prescription of
   protecting new reclamation sites from grazing and trampling is
   supported.}},
