Abstract = {{1. Seasonal pasture wetlands are a common freshwater habitat in many
   agricultural landscapes, but their invertebrate diversity has rarely
   been examined compared with other freshwater habitats. Few studies have
   examined the role of seasonal wetlands for regional biodiversity or the
   pattern of change in assemblage composition across landscapes.
   2. Invertebrates were sampled from 16 naturally occurring seasonal
   wetlands and three perennial wetlands in south-western Victoria,
   Australia. The wetlands were arranged in three clusters, separated by at
   least 20 km: two clusters each contained one perennial and four seasonal
   wetlands surrounded by pasture; the remaining cluster consisted of one
   perennial wetland and four seasonal wetlands on a property that has not
   been cleared of native vegetation, and four adjacent seasonal pasture
   wetlands cleared of native vegetation.
   3. Presence/absence data showed that seasonal wetlands had fewer taxa
   than perennial wetlands, but both were taxon rich. Turnover of taxa was
   high at all three scales, i.e. between samples within a wetland, between
   wetlands, and between wetland clusters, but each Cluster did not have a
   characteristic assemblage composition. Up to two-thirds of the
   invertebrate taxa found in perennial wetlands were also found in
   seasonal wetlands, showing that seasonal pasture wetlands could provide
   an expanded area of winter spring habitat for many taxa.
   4. Seasonal pasture wetlands contribute to biodiversity in highly
   managed and depauperate agricultural landscapes. There was little
   regionalization of the fauna, taxon turnover was high and ranges
   appeared relatively continuous. Biodiversity in pasture wetlands was
   comparable to perennial non-pasture wetlands elsewhere, despite being
   used for grazing livestock. This suggests that pasture wetlands may have
   substantial conservation value and should be managed to protect them
   from threatening processes such as drainage. Copyright (C) 2005 John

Abstract = {{Episodic high rainfall has been proposed as an important factor in
   perennial species recruitment but flooding based on rainfall at a
   distance from the site has received little attention. Although such
   flood events in arid Australia are rare, studies of the ephemeral Olary
   Creek indicate that occasional floods can also have a high impact on the
   vegetation and landscape. During February 1997, a high-rainfall event
   caused flooding in the Olary Creek. One branch of the creek created a
   terminal lake within mallee vegetation on Nagaela Station in far-western
   New South Wales. The flood path of Olary Creek and this terminal lake
   allow study of the importance of rainfall-driven flood events in shaping
   vegetation in arid environments. This paper reports (i) the response of
   arid land plant species to high-rainfall-driven episodic flood events
   and (ii) how grazing pressure from native and introduced herbivores can
   impact on native species response.
   A systematic study was conducted to understand the botanical composition
   in flooded and control areas based on 25 m 2 fenced and unfenced plots
   subjected to flooding and non-flooding. For 6 years following flooding,
   species richness in the flooded area was twice that of unflooded areas.
   In particular, 27 native species from 13 families were recorded both in
   the enclosed and open plots located in the flooded area. Over the study
   period nine species: Brachyscome ciliaris, Helichrysum leucopsidium,
   Vittadinia cuneata, Casuarina pauper, Maireana sedifolia, Salsola kali,
   Sclerolaena obliquicuspis, Eremophila sturtii and Eucalyptus foecunda
   germinated only in the flooded enclosed plots. Further, 11 exotic
   species from five families were recorded in the flooded ( both enclosed
   and open) plots over the study period. Knowledge gained from this study
   will contribute to management strategies for arid land vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{The land area covered by powerline easements in the United States
   exceeds the area of almost all national parks, including Yellowstone. In
   parts of Europe and the US, electric companies have altered their land
   management practices from periodic mowing to extraction of tall
   vegetation combined with the use of selective herbicides. To investigate
   whether this alternate management practice might produce higher quality
   habitat for native bees, we compared the bee fauna collected in unmowed
   powerline corridors and in nearby mowed grassy fields at the Patuxent
   Wildlife Research Center (MD). Powerline sites had more spatially and
   numerically rare species and a richer bee community than the grassy
   fields, although the difference was less pronounced than we expected.
   Powerline sites also had more parasitic species and more cavity-nesting
   bees. Bee communities changed progressively through the season, but
   differences between the site types were persistent. The surrounding,
   non-grassland landscape likely has a strong influence on the bee species
   collected at the grassland sites, as some bees may be foraging in the
   grasslands but nesting elsewhere. Improving habitat for native bees will
   help ameliorate the loss of pollination services caused by the collapse
   of wild and managed honeybee populations. This study suggests that
   powerline strips have the potential to provide five million acres of
   bee-friendly habitat in the US if utilities more generally adopt
   appropriate management practices. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{In the semi-arid grasslands of the west pampas, in Argentina, extended
   natural grasslands still persist only with cattle grazing. However, in
   the last years there has been an important increase in the cultivation
   of African pasture species. We evaluated the incidence of the
   replacement of natural grasslands by exotic pastures on bird diversity
   in spring summer and in winter. In five different grassland habitats
   (two native and three sown pastures), we sampled bird populations using
   the strip transect method and vegetation variables simultaneously at the
   same sites. We used multiple regressions to examine the relative
   importance of habitat variables on richness, abundance and presence of
   bird species. The replacement of native grasslands (Sorgastral) by sown
   pastures results in habitat modifications such as changes in green
   vegetation, percentage of bare ground and distance to trees. When native
   grasslands are moderately grazed (mixed grassland) plant species
   richness increases notably relative to other native and exotic pastures.
   Some vegetation variables were correlated with bird species richness or
   with some bird populations. However, the habitat variable that best
   described bird species richness and bird abundance was plant species
   richness, which varied both with the grazing history of the native
   grassland and with the type of pasture used as replacement.
   Consequently, grassland replacement by sown pastures in the west pampas
   results in changes in bird alpha diversity; decreasing diversity with
   respect to mixed grasslands, but favoring it in relation to the climax
   grassland (Sorgastral). The composition of grassland bird communities in
   natural grasslands would be little affected by exotic pastures
   replacement. However, since some vegetation variables best represented
   in some habitats had particular effects on the abundance and presence of
   specific grassland birds, managers and policy makers should take into
   account the complexity of the processes associated with changes in land
   use of the west pampas. This would not only decrease the probability of
   negative effects on the total bird diversity but also would decrease the
   risk of local extinction of declining species. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Common kestrels (Falco tinnunculus) and long-eared owls (Asio otus) in
   intensively farmed areas in Switzerland decreased markedly as a result
   of declining vole (Microtus spp.) populations. In order to counteract
   the loss of biodiversity in intensively farmed areas, the Swiss
   agri-environment scheme stipulates several types of ecological
   compensation areas, which together should take up 7\% of the farmland.
   Among them are wild flower and herbaceous strips, which are not mown
   every year and which in summer support up to 8 times more small mammals
   than ordinary fields and grassland. This study investigates whether
   kestrels and long-eared owls preferentially hunt on ecological
   compensation areas and whether preferred hunting areas are related to
   the density of small mammals or to the density and height of the
   vegetation. Both kestrels and long-eared owls mainly hunted on freshly
   mown low-intensity meadows and artificial grassland, despite low
   densities of small mammals. Therefore, vegetation structure was more
   important for the selection of hunting sites than prey abundance.
   However, both predators preferred to hunt on freshly mown grassland and
   meadows bordering a wild flower or herbaceous strip. Voles from these
   strips probably invaded the adjacent freshly mown grassland and became
   an easy prey for kestrels and owls. In intensively farmed regions,
   ecological compensation areas, particularly those not mown each year,
   are an important refuge for small mammals, although in summer the small
   mammals are not directly accessible to hunting birds. Hence, a mosaic of
   different habitat types with grassland mown at different times of the
   year together with undisturbed strips is best suited to provide a
   year-round supply of accessible food for vole hunters.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification is responsible for the dramatic decline of
   farmland bird populations in the European Union (EU). The joining of
   eight Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries to the EU will
   re-structure agriculture there. One of the main threats is the
   intensification of farmland management. Can agri-environmental programs
   balance the expected decline in bird assemblages of the CEE countries if
   farming will be intensified? We studied this question by comparing bird
   assemblages of 42 extensively and intensively grazed paired fields in
   three regions of Hungary (alkali steppes and meadows in Central Hungary
   and alkali steppes in Eastern Hungary). Bird assemblages varied
   significantly across regions and grazing intensity. Intensively grazed
   sites showed a higher species number and diversity, but lower densities
   than the extensive sites. This is probably the consequence of higher
   landscape diversity of intensive sites, which included farm buildings,
   shelters, wells and other structures. Several bird species, mainly with
   European conservation concern, showed contrasting responses to grazing
   intensity in the three regions, including key grassland species
   (black-tailed godwit Limosa limosa, redshank Tringa totanus, skylark
   Alauda arvensis and corn bunting Emberiza calandra). Therefore, threat
   and sensitivity to grassland characteristics are correlating. Although
   many of the declining species of Western Europe are still abundant in
   Hungarian grasslands, our results project the threat of the expected
   intensification. This study showed that it is not possible to provide a
   general grassland management scheme that will favour all bird species in
   all regions of Hungary. In the process of integrating to the EU and
   restructuring agriculture, the establishment of scientifically sound
   schemes is urgent. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cattle grazing is generally recommended for management of semi-natural
   grassland, but its effects on flora are insufficiently studied in
   northern Europe. Plant species responses to cattle grazing of mesic
   semi-natural grasslands were studied in SW Finland managed by private
   farmers under three kinds of management: old (continuously grazed, n =
   10), restored new (grazing restarted 3-8 years ago, n = 10) and
   abandoned pastures (grazing ceased > 10 years ago, n = 11).
   Positive effects of cattle grazing were observed on most grassland
   plants, 34 species being significantly more frequent in grazed than in
   abandoned grassland and four in abandoned than in grazed grassland. The
   frequencies of most species in restored new pastures were between those
   observed in old and in abandoned pastures. Changes in species number
   with different Ellenberg indicator values showed that grazing increased
   the number of species indicating nitrogen-poor soils, high light
   intensity and low soil moisture, but decreased species indicating
   nitrogen-rich soils. Grazing was beneficial to indicator species of both
   high and low pH. Species numbers in new pastures were consistently
   between those of old and abandoned pastures.
   Based on Ellenberg indicator values, restored grazing changed species
   assemblages towards that of old pastures. Many grassland species seem to
   recover under grazing regimes applied by private farmers, but
   insufficient management quality may prevent full success of restoration.

Abstract = {{Aims: The existence of interannual variations in the richness and
   abundance of bird species breeding in pseudo-steppic Mediterranean areas
   is analysed and related to the important fluctuations that take place in
   rainfall, which in turn deeply influence vegetation growth. The
   hypothesis of food limitation as a key factor in determining population
   sizes, allows the prediction of the existence of positive correlations
   between these parameters.
   Location: The study was carried out in the Extremadura region,
   south-west Spain. Seven areas of pseudo-steppes were selected,
   characterized by large treeless plains devoted to un-irrigated cereal
   cultivations and/or extensive grazing grasslands. Climate is typically
   Mediterranean and semi-arid, with annual rainfall around 400-600 mm,
   mild and relatively wet winters, and very dry and hot summers.
   Methods: Bird communities were surveyed by means of point counts, placed
   along fixed routes which were repeated every year in the same spring
   dates (14 to 27 point counts in each locality). Surveys were conducted
   in five different years, three of them consecutive. Data regarding
   changes in rainfall were obtained from meteorological stations placed in
   or very close to the study areas.
   Results: Cumulative rainfall during the months preceding breeding bird
   censuses (January to April) showed significant inter-annual variations.
   Densities of several breeding bird species also exhibited important
   changes along the study period, especially noticeable among grassland or
   steppic species (those nesting in the ground), where they were
   statistically significant for most of the common species. Fluctuations
   among years of bird densities usually took place in parallel to those of
   rainfall. Average richness was positively correlated to rainfall in the
   whole of the breeding bird community, as well as in the steppic birds
   group, but it was not correlated to rainfall in the non-steppic birds
   group (species usually nesting in buildings or trees). Analysis of the
   variance by species allowed us to differentiate in the inter-annual
   variations the effects of years and localities. In only three steppic
   species there were significant changes mainly explained by differences
   between years and at the same time, showing a positive significant
   correlation with rainfall (Quail Coturnix coturnix, Fan-tailed Warbler
   Cisticola juncidis and Corn Bunting Emberiza calandra). On the other
   hand, there were species apparently not affected by rainfall, among them
   all or most belonging to the non-steppic group.
   Conclusions: The parallel and spatially synchronic fluctuations of
   cumulative rainfall, indices of vegetation growth, and densities of
   several grassland bird species, agree with a limiting role of the
   resources linked to vegetation, whose marked reduction during dry years
   would impose reductions in the population sizes of those species.
   Nevertheless, changes in rainfall and plant productivity do not affect
   many other bird species, among them all or most in the non-steppic
   group, making difficult to assume that the limiting factors are directly
   related to food (although insectivorous species may have fluctuated on
   average more than seed-eating species). An alternative or complementary
   explanation may link the decreases in abundances of certain species to
   the simplification taking place during dry years in the habitat
   structural complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Patch formation is common in grazed grasslands but the mechanisms
   involved in the formation and maintenance of patches are not clear. To
   increase our knowledge on this subject we examined possible reasons for
   patch formation and the influence of management on changes between patch
   states in three experiments in native pasture communities in the Crows
   Nest district, south-east Queensland. In these communities, small-scale
   patches (tall grassland (dominated by large and medium tussock grasses),
   short swards (dominated by short tussock grasses and sedges), and lawns
   (dominated by stoloniferous and/or rhizomatous grasses)) are readily
   apparent. We hypothesized that the formation of short sward and lawn
   patches in areas of tall grassland was due to combinations of grazing
   and soil fertility effects. This was tested in Experiment 1 by applying
   a factorial combination of defoliation, nutrient application and
   transplants of short tussock and stoloniferous species to a uniform area
   of tall grassland. Total species density declined during the experiment,
   was lower with high nutrient applications, but was not affected by
   defoliation. There were significant changes in abundance of species that
   provided support for our hypotheses. With light defoliation and low
   nutrients, the tall grassland remained dominated by large tussock
   grasses and contained considerable amounts of forbs. With heavy
   defoliation, the pastures were dominated by medium tussock grasses and
   there were significant decreases in forbs and increases in sedges
   (mainly with low nutrients) and stoloniferous grasses (mainly with high
   nutrients). Total germinable seed densities and those of most species
   groups were significantly lower in the heavy defoliation than the light
   defoliation plots. Total soil seed numbers were not affected by nutrient
   application but there were fewer seeds of the erect forbs and more sedge
   seeds in plots with high nutrients. The use of resting from grazing and
   fire to manage transitions between patches was tested. In Experiment 2,
   changes in species density and abundance were measured for 5 years in
   the three patch types with and without grazing. Experiment 3 examined
   the effects of fire, grazing and resting on short sward patches over 4
   years. In Experiment 2, total species density was lower in lawn than
   short sward or tall grassland patches, and there were more species of
   erect forbs than other plant groups in all patch types. The lawn patches
   were originally dominated by Cynodon spp. This dominance continued with
   grazing but in ungrazed patches the abundance of Cynodon spp. declined
   and that of forbs increased. In the short sward patches, dominance of
   short tussock grasses continued with grazing but in ungrazed plots their
   abundance declined while that of large tussock grasses increased. The
   tall grassland patches remained dominated by large and medium tussock
   species. In Experiment 3, fire had no effect on species abundance. On
   the grazed plots the short tussock grasses remained dominant but where
   the plots were rested from grazing the small tussock grasses declined
   and the large tussock grasses increased in abundance. The slow and
   relatively small changes in these experiments over 4 or 5 years showed
   how stable the composition of these pastures is, and that rapid changes
   between patch types are unlikely.}},

Abstract = {{Roadsides form potential habitats for several grassland species adapted
   to regular mowing management. We studied the communities of butterflies
   and day-active moths in 51 sites along the verges of the three road
   types, i.e., highways, urban roads and rural roads. Despite different
   traffic densities and widths of the road and verge, the groups were
   rather similar with regard to soil properties, vegetation structure and
   mowing intensity. The species richness and total abundance of
   butterflies (53 species, 5964 individuals) and diurnal moths (46
   species, 4626 individuals) were also rather similar in each road type,
   although a preference for wider verges was observed. Butterfly diversity
   increased (but not significantly) from the verges of narrow rural roads
   to wider highways. The highest numbers of meadow species were recorded
   along highways and the total abundance, especially of diurnal moths,
   decreased in accordance with the road size. High nectar abundance was
   the most important factor increasing the numbers of meadow butterflies
   along road verges, while meadow moths were mostly favoured by shelter
   provided by tall vegetation. Verges surrounded by cultivated fields were
   generally related to low numbers of both Lepidoptera groups, whereas
   adjacent forests increased the total number of all species and favoured
   several butterflies inhabiting forest edges. The adjacent environment
   inflicted compositional differences on the Lepidoptera fauna of the
   three road types. The results indicate that road verges should be
   considered an important reserve for species dependent on semi-natural
   grasslands in Finland. A growing interest in accommodating current
   roadside management for conserving biodiversity is likely to benefit
   Lepidoptera communities in the verge habitats. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Vegetation destruction resulting from overgrazing and conversion of
   rangelands to agricultural use is one of the biggest causes of land
   desertification and biodiversity loss. The community cover, biomass,
   species composition, species richness, and species diversity of each of
   six sites protected from grazing for times ranging from 3 to 45 years
   were investigated in a semi-arid sandy region called Horqin Sandy Land,
   northern China. Community cover was maximal in the site with 45 years
   protection from grazing, and biomass was maximal in the site with 18
   years' protection due to the vigorous growth of Artemisia halodendron.
   Species richness and diversity tended to increase as protected time
   increased. The results showed that up to 45 years' protection from
   grazing produced positive and encouraging changes in the site. As the
   number of years of protection increased, the development of community
   structure and restoration of community function increased. The study
   provided an example of grassland recovery under natural conditions in
   this semi-arid sandy region, and suggested that protection from grazing
   may be an effective, financially economical and natural way to restore
   vegetation. It is suggested that this could be of great significance for

Abstract = {{The breeding phenology of three grassland bird species was studied in
   managed hayfields of Nova Scotia, Canada: bobolink (Dolichonyx
   oryzivorus), savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and Nelson's
   sharp-tailed sparrow (Ammodramus nelsoni subvirgatus), under delayed hay
   cutting regimes (post-1 July). Weekly changes were monitored in several
   measures of hay nutritional quality (percent crude protein (CP \%), acid
   detergent fibre (ADF), calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P)). Timing of peak
   fledging was variable across years, but generally occurred in the first
   week of July. Delay of cutting by 1 week in late June or early July
   resulted in a small reduction in hay nutritional quality. However, that
   hay would still meet energy and CP\% requirements for non-lactating beef
   cows. Regression models showed that a delay of 1.5 weeks (from 20 June
   to 1 July) in cutting translated to a mean decrease in CP \% of 2.1.
   Conversely, this delay secured an increase in the rate of fledgling,
   from 0 to 20\% for bobolink, 56\% for savannah sparrow, and 44\% for
   Nelson's sharp-tailed sparrow. Postponing cut by 1 more week (to a
   minimum of 7 July) gave the benefit of allowing maximum fledging rates
   for all species, while CP \% lost 3.5. While this level of CP \% is
   unlikely to support high maintenance periparturient cows and
   feeder/finisher cattle, it could be made profitable through mineral
   supplementation. ADF levels were considerably elevated, while Ca and P
   improved in the same time period. These trends show delayed hay cutting
   can be a viable option for farmers opting to conserve breeding birds on
   hayfields. The feasibility of delaying cut varies with a farm's
   specialization, and to a degree, breed kept. Such practices can be
   incorporated into a holistic approach to agroecosystem management. (c)

Abstract = {{Question: What is the long-term compositional response of brass and forb
   species to various combinations of burning and mowina? Can these
   responses be predicted from simple plant traits?
   Location: Ukulinga research and training farm (24 degrees 24'E, 30
   degrees 24'S), Pietermaritzburg, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
   Methods: Grass species relative abundance in 1996 in various buming and
   mowing treatments of a long-term (> 50 a) experiment was calculated from
   data obtained using a point sampling method, whereas forb species
   abundance in 1999 was determined using the importance score method. The
   experiment consisted of different frequencies (annual, biennial and
   triennial) of burning and mowing in winter or spring in combination with
   different frequencies of summer mowing (none, early, late or both).
   Results: Grasses responded to the type of disturbance (burn or mow) and
   frequency of burning, whereas forbs responded primarily to the presence
   or absence of any form of disturbance and secondarily to the timing of
   burning (spring versus winter). Summer mowing and annual or biennial
   dormant-period burning maintained communities dominated by short
   grasses, whereas tall grasses dominated under annual dormant-period
   mowing, triennial burning or protection from disturbance. Grass
   tittering strategy (below- or above-ground) influenced response to
   burning frequency. Many erect herbaceous dicot species with aerial
   meristems were reduced in abundance by summer mowing whereas most small
   creeping herbaceous dicot species appeared to be dependent upon summer
   mowing.
   Conclusions: This long-term experiment demonstrated that: (1) grasses
   and forbs responded differently to burning and mowing; (2) simple plant
   traits, such as height, position of tiller initiation, and position of
   meristems have potential for predicting the response of species to the
   timing and frequency of burning and mowing.}},

Abstract = {{We examined patterns of nutrient heterogeneity in the mineral soil (0-15
   cm depth) of 13 southern Appalachian forest stands in western North
   Carolina > 60 yr after abandonment from pasture or timber harvest to
   investigate the long-term effects of land use on the spatial
   distribution and supply of soil resources. We measured soil carbon (C),
   nitrogen (N), acid-extractable phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium
   (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) concentrations and pools, and potential net N
   mineralization and nitrification rates to evaluate differences in mean
   values, variance at multiple scales, and fine-scale spatial structure.
   While comparisons of averaged values rarely indicated that historical
   land use had an enduring effect on mineral soil or N cycling,
   differences in variance and spatial structure suggested that former
   activities continue to influence nutrient distributions by altering
   their spatial heterogeneity. Patterns differed by element, but generally
   variance of soil C, N, and Ca decreased and variance of soil P, K, and
   Mg increased with intensive past land use. Changes in variance were most
   conspicuous and consistent locally (< 28 in), but C, Ca, P, and Mg, also
   exhibited appreciable differences in variance at coarser scales (> 150
   m). High variability in soil compaction resulted in some changes in
   scale-dependent patterns of nutrient pool variance compared with
   nutrient concentration variance. It also affected the variance of N
   cycling rates, such that mass-based rates varied less and area-based
   rates varied more in intensively used areas than in reference stands.
   Geostatistical analysis suggested that past land use homogenized the
   spatial structure of soil C, K, and P in former pastures. In contrast,
   logged stands had highly variable spatial patterning for Ca.
   These results suggest that land use has persistent, multi-decadal
   effects on the spatial heterogeneity of soil resources, which may not be
   detectable when values are averaged across sites. By interacting with
   patterns of variability in the plant and heterotrophic biota,
   differences in nutrient distribution and supply could alter the
   composition and diversity of forest ecosystems. Scale-dependent changes
   in nutrient heterogeneity could also complicate efforts to determine
   biogeochemical budgets and cycling rates.}},

   migrating ungulates determine plant SR in grasslands of Yellowstone
   National Park. Plant SR at peak aboveground biomass was compared inside
   and outside ungulate exclosures at two spatial scales, 1.0 m(2)
   ({''}local{''}) and 100 m(2) ({''}community{''}), in ten variable
   grasslands. NAP also was determined inside and outside exclosures. The
   relationship between SR and NAP was unimodal for grazed and ungrazed
   grassland at both spatial scales. Grazers increased local SR,
   independent of NAP. In contrast, herbivore effects on community SR
   ranged from no effect among low-productive grassland to an increasingly
   positive influence as NAP increased. In addition, ungulates reduced beta
   diversity (the contribution to community SR attributed to variability
   among local patches) at dry, low-productive and wet high-productive
   sites. These results suggest that the size of the pool of species
   available to colonize grassland is an important factor controlling the
   response of grassland SR to herbivory, particularly from low- to
   intermediate-productive grassland.}},

Abstract = {{A three-year multi-factorial microcosm experiment simulating
   fertilisation, defoliation and the composition of vascular vegetation in
   a dry grassland succession was used to test four hypotheses concerning
   the establishment and survival of bryophytes in grassland vegetation.
   H-1: bryophyte cover may be used to predict bryophyte species richness.
   H-2: bryophyte richness is suppressed at high nutrient levels and
   promoted by defoliation of vascular plants. H-3: species richness of
   bryophytes is influenced by the species composition of the vascular
   vegetation. H-4: bryophyte species richness is negatively correlated
   with vascular plant biomass.
   The relationship between bryophyte richness and bryophyte cover was
   found to follow the classical species-area richness curve. Bryophyte
   species richness responded positively to defoliation and negatively to
   fertilisation. The species composition of vascular vegetation had no
   significant effect on bryophyte richness. Bryophyte species richness was
   lower at high vascular plant biomass and vascular plant dry weight above
   400 g m(-2) appeared fatal to bryophytes. At high nutrient levels,
   defoliation increased bryophyte richness, but defoliation did not fully
   compensate for the negative effect of fertilisation. The study
   reinforces the concern for short lived shuttle bryophytes in the
   agricultural landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Cattle grazing is often implicated as a factor that reduces vegetative
   cover and the abundance of important forage plants for wildlife. Recent
   declines in northern Arizona populations of pronghorn (Antilocapra
   americana Ord) have focused public and scientific attention on the
   factors contributing to low fawn recruitment and the potential benefits
   of cattle removal. To further understand the effects of cattle grazing,
   we studied the potential hiding cover provided by standing live and dead
   herbaceous matter as well as forb richness and canopy cover following 5
   years of cattle removal. Cattle removal increased horizontal hiding
   cover by 8\% at a distance of 5 in (P = 0.025), but had no statistically
   significant effect on the potential hiding cover at distances of 10 in
   (P = 0.105) or 25 in (P = 0.746). Forb species richness was 16\% lower
   in exclosures than in an adjacent grazed pasture in 2001 (P = 0.036),
   but no differences were observed in 2002 (P = 0.636). The canopy cover
   of forbs was generally unaffected by cattle removal. These results
   suggest that curtailing or removing cattle is unlikely, by itself, to
   lead to rapid improvements in the hiding cover or forb availability for
   pronghorn on similar rangelands in northern Arizona. In this region,
   where immediate improvements in fawn survival and recruitment are
   important to population persistence, additional management actions
   should be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Loss of photosynthetic area can affect soil microbial communities by
   altering the availability of fixed carbon. We used denaturing gradient
   gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and Biolog filamentous-fungus plates to
   determine the effects of artificial defoliation of pines in a mixed
   pine-spruce forest on the composition of the fungal community in a
   forest soil. As measured by DGGE, two fungal species were affected
   significantly by the defoliation of pines (P < 0.001); the frequency of
   members of the ectomycorrhizal fungus genus Cenococcum decreased
   significantly, while the frequency of organisms of an unidentified soil
   fungus increased. The decrease in the amount of Cenococcum organisms may
   have occurred because of the formation of extensive hyphal networks by
   species of this genus, which require more of the carbon fixed by their
   host, or because this fungus is dependent upon quantitative differences
   in spruce root exudates. The defoliation of pines did not affect the
   overall composition of the soil fungal community or fungal-species
   richness (number of species per core). Biolog filamentous-fungus plate
   assays indicated a significant increase (P < 0.001) in the number of
   carbon substrates utilized by the soil fungi and the rate at which these
   substrates were used, which could indicate an increase in fungal-species
   richness. Thus, either small changes in the soil fungal community give
   rise to significant increases in physiological capabilities or PCR bias
   limits the reliability of the DGGE results. These data indicate that
   combined genetic and physiological assessments of the soil fungal
   community are needed to accurately assess the effect of disturbance on
   indigenous microbial systems.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of restorative grazing on the abundance of butterfly and
   moth species were studied in mesic semi-natural grasslands of SW Finland
   differing in management history: (1) old continuously grazed, (2)
   restored (with ca 5 years of reinitiated grazing), and (3) abandoned
   former pastures.
   Generalized linear modelling of species abundances and indicator species
   analysis produced qualitatively similar results. Only three species
   (Polyommatus icarus, Lycaena hippothoe and Camptogramma bilineatum) were
   most abundant in old pastures, whereas 12 species (Polyommatus
   semiargus, Polyommatus amandus, Brenthis ino, Aphantopus hyperantus,
   Scopula immorata, Idaea serpentata, Scotopteryx chenopodiata, Epirrhoe
   alternata, Cybosia mesomella, Polypogon tentacularius, Hypena
   proboscidalis and Cryptocala chardinyi) were most abundant in abandoned
   pastures. None of the old-pasture species had become more abundant in
   restored pastures. Three species, Epirrhoe hastulata, Xanthorhoe
   montanata and Chiasmia clathrata. occurred equally abundantly in
   abandoned and in restored pastures indicating a slow progress of
   restoration.
   Species associated with old pastures differed from species associated
   with abandoned pastures in their recent distributional changes in
   Finland. The species of old pastures showed decreasing trends. whereas
   those of abandoned pastures showed mainly increasing trends in their
   distribution. In five out of I I species, the preferred successional
   stage differed markedly between this study and previous studies
   conducted in Central Europe.
   We conclude that (1) ca 5 years of restorative grazing in mesic
   grasslands has been insufficient for the colonisation of old-pasture
   species in the restored sites, (2) different management intensities are
   needed regionally for the maintenance of grassland insect diversity and
   (3) application of the knowledge on successional preferences of
   different species in conservation management. even in climatically
   similar regions, should be made with caution. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{As human impacts on the environment intensify, the future of plant and
   animal biodiversity will depend increasingly on the floras surviving in
   human-dominated ``countryside{''} habitats. To begin to characterize
   these floras for the Neotropics, we investigated the richness and
   composition of herbaceous and shrubby plant communities in six forested
   and deforested habitats, in three replicated study areas (7.5-km in
   diameter), of southern Costa Rica. We chose habitat types that are
   common throughout the tropics, to begin building a general understanding
   of both the habitats of origin and the diversity of countryside floras.
   Focal forest habitats were understory, 1- to 2-year-old tree-fall gaps,
   and riverbanks, all in primary forest. Focal deforested habitats were
   ungrazed road verges, grazed pasture, and riverbanks in grazed pasture.
   Non-riverbank habitats were sampled both near and far from. forest edge.
   In total, we sampled 772 species from 79 families, similar to 40\% of
   the non-tree plant diversity of the region. Only 6\% of identified
   species are known to be exotic. In each study area, understory and
   pasture plots were consistently species poor, while tree-fall gaps and
   road verges near forest were consistently the most species-rich
   habitats. In each study area, we found the same proportion of species
   restricted to forested habitats (similar to 45\%) and deforested
   habitats (similar to 37\%), and the same proportion of
   ``countryside-habitat generalists{''} ( similar to 18\%) occurring in
   both forested and deforested habitats. However, different forested
   habitats supported different proportions of country side-habitat
   generalists in each study area, although understory plots consistently
   `supported the fewest generalists. Among forested habitats, riverbanks
   were the most similar floristically to deforested habitats. Pasture
   riverbanks and road verges near forest supported plant communities most
   similar to those in forested habitats. The uniqueness and richness of
   each habitat suggests that countrysides with diverse land uses can
   support many native herbaceous and shrubby plant species. As it becomes
   increasingly difficult to protect large tracts of undisturbed tropical
   forest, we suggest that conservation goals expand to encompass
   maintenance of heterogeneity in countryside landscapes.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Two independent models concerning the effects of grazing on vegetation
   have gained wide acceptance in the last decade: Westoby et al.'s state-
   and- transition (ST) model, and Milchunas et al.'s generalized model of
   the effects of grazing on plant community structure and diversity (MSL
   model). These two prevailing models, as they stand, are conceptually
   divergent. The MSL model implicitly assumes that, at a given site, for
   each grazing intensity there is a single equilibrium situation with a
   single diversity value. The S-T model suggests that rangeland dynamics
   include irreversible transitions and alternative equilibria. Here we
   propose a modification of the original MSL model, to encompass a wider
   range of real situations and to place it within the context of the S-T
   model. The-four extreme cases proposed in the original MSL model are
   revisited, taking into account that (1) the ``moisture{''} gradient can
   be generalized as a ``productivity{''} gradient; (2) the selective
   pressure of herbivores on systems with long history of grazing has
   fluctuated over time, allowing the development of different pools of
   species adapted to low or high grazing intensities; and (3) systems with
   long evolutionary history of grazing. have developed resilience
   mechanisms that allow reversible shifts in floristic composition with
   changes in grazing intensities. The grazing intensity vs. diversity
   curves thus postulated for systems with a long evolutionary history of
   grazing are similar to those proposed by the original MSL model because
   resilience mechanisms allow for reversible changes associated with
   grazing intensity. In contrast, the curves postulated for systems with
   short evolutionary history. of grazing include different alternative
   branches, indicating irreversible transitions, because resilience
   mechanisms to grazing were not fully developed. By incorporating these
   modifications, the divergence between the original MSL and S-T models
   can be resolved. A set of published examples from real systems is
   presented and compared with the predictions of the modified model. The
   modified MSL model is applicable to a wider range of real situations
   than the MSL model in its original formulation.}},

Abstract = {{Plant functional traits provide one tool for predicting the effects of
   grazing on different ecosystems. To test this approach, we compared
   plant traits and grazing response across analogous climatic gradients in
   sagebrush steppe, USA (SGBR), known to have a short evolutionary history
   of grazing, and Patagonian steppe, Argentina (PAT), where generalist
   herbivores exerted stronger selective pressures. We measured grazing
   response by sampling vegetation and soils across distance-from-water
   gradients at arid, semiarid, and subhumid study areas in both regions.
   Based on a previous analysis of graminoid traits, we predicted that: (1)
   high forage quality in all three SGBR communities would lead to high
   utilization and large grazing effects, whereas low quality in and PAT
   would constrain utilization and grazing impacts, with semiarid and
   subhumid PAT intermediate in quality and grazing response; and (2)
   grazing in and PAT would cause shifts in relative abundance within the
   graminoid functional group, due to the large range of forage quality
   among graminoids, but in SGBR, where all graminoids are relatively
   palatable, shifts in abundance would occur between grasses and shrubs.
   Utilization in locations close to water was higher in SGBR than in PAT
   study areas. This utilization difference led to differences in grazing
   effects consistent with our first prediction. Abundance of graminoids
   increased with distance from water in all three SGBR communities and in
   subhumid PAT, but not in arid PAT. Shrub and total production decreased
   with distance in SGBR but not PAT study areas. Grazing variables
   explained less variation in species composition in arid PAT (43\%) than
   in any other study area (59-74\%). Grazing did not significantly
   influence species richness. Evidence for our second prediction was
   mixed. Grazing did alter the relative abundance of SGBR graminoids and
   shrubs, but abundance shifts among the graminoids in SGBR communities
   were larger than in PAT communities, counter to our prediction.
   This case study demonstrates how plant traits can explain relative
   effects of grazing on ecosystem structure and functioning, although
   predicting species-specific responses remains a challenge. Regardless of
   their evolutionary origin, poor-quality graminoids make the and
   Patagonian steppe more resistant to overgrazing than communities
   dominated by more nutritious species.}},

Abstract = {{1. The extensive loss of species-rich grasslands in Europe as a result
   of agricultural intensification has triggered a desire to recreate more
   diverse and natural grassland systems in set-aside fields. Appropriate
   management and species introductions are necessary to overcome residual
   soil fertility, lack of suitable plant propagules and dominance of
   undesirable invasive species.
   2. A field experiment was performed in a boreal former hayfield to test
   the effect of turf inoculation, mowing (twice annually) and spring
   burning. We surveyed changes in plant diversity, composition and
   productivity over a 3-year period. Signature fatty acids and soil
   respiration measurements were employed to survey changes in the soil
   community.
   3. Few changes in the vegetation and soil communities could be related
   to inoculation of turf monoliths. Most of the measured variables in mown
   plots differed from the set-aside (control) plots, while burned plots
   displayed mainly similar responses. Mowing increased plant species
   richness and diversity, mainly by enhancing the number and frequency of
   forb species. Small-statured forb species were promoted by mowing,
   whereas tall leafy grasses declined. Effects of mowing on soil
   communities comprised an increased soil respiration and stimulation of
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi.
   4. Synthesis and applications. The results demonstrate the importance of
   reducing sward height in order to promote plant species coexistence in
   former boreal hayfields. In such systems, eliminating accumulated litter
   by spring burning has little influence on species composition when the
   sward is allowed to grow tall. Mowing is therefore the most efficient
   way of enhancing biodiversity. The results also show that
   mowing-mediated changes in above-ground plant communities may stimulate
   below-ground symbiotic micro-organisms, potentially resulting in a
   positive feedback on ecosystem development.}},

Abstract = {{Herbivores influence the structure of plant communities in arctic-alpine
   ecosystems. However, little is known of the effect of herbivores on
   plant colonisation following disturbance, and on its variability
   depending on the identity of herbivores and the characteristics of the
   habitats. To quantify the role of large and small vertebrate herbivores,
   we established exclosures of two different mesh sizes around disturbed
   subplots in forest and nearby tundra habitats in four contrasting
   locations in the forest-tundra ecotone in northernmost Sweden and
   Norway. The study revealed that herbivores influenced the abundance but
   not the species composition of regenerating vegetation. Gaps were
   colonised by the dominant species in the surrounding vegetation. The
   only exception to this expectation was Empetrum nigrum, which failed to
   colonise gaps even though it dominated undisturbed vegetation.
   Significant effects of herbivory were only detected when both small and
   large herbivores were excluded. Herbivores decreased the abundance of
   three of the most common species Vaccinium myrtillus, Vaccinium vitis
   idaea, and Deschampsia flexuosa. The effect of herbivory on the
   abundance of these three species did not differ between habitats and
   locations. However, the composition of the regenerating vegetation
   differed between habitats and locations. The disturbance treatment
   increased the species richness on the scale of plots, habitats, and
   sites. However, on the scale of whole locations, all species found in
   disturbed areas were also found in undisturbed areas, suggesting that
   the natural disturbance regime in arctic landscapes is high enough to
   sustain colonising species.}},

Abstract = {{In the Mediterranean region, cycles of controlled burning combined with
   continuous grazing appear to have been an effective tool for maintaining
   isolated Calluna vulgaris heathlands in the form in which they occur in
   many places in the Atlantic region. Changes in land use and management
   of the mosaic of extensively exploited heathland and associated
   grassland over recent decades, such as bringing land into cultivation
   followed by its abandonment and the prohibition of fires has resulted in
   a process of transformation into new shrub communities with lower
   biodiversity. In the Mediterranean region, these changes are similar to
   those described in the Atlantic area, but encroachment occurs faster and
   could lead ultimately to afforestation by Mediterranean woodland.
   In a study area of 300 ha of heathland in the Spanish Mediterranean
   basin (specifically, in the Montseny Natural Park and Biosphere
   Reserve), comparison of present and former vegetation showed that shrub
   cover increased from 15\% in 1967 to 32\% in 2000. Broom (Cytisus
   scoparius) was the main invasive species in abandoned crop fields,
   whereas Mediterranean holm oak forest (Quercus ilex) increased by 18\%.
   The surface area of fernlands doubled and C. vulgaris heathlands
   decreased from 35\% to just 9\% during the same period. Intermixed
   grasslands also decreased moderately and progressively from 4\% to 3\%.
   It seems probable that cycles of fires are more important in terms of
   shrub control and biodiversity conservation than continuous grazing
   alone, even at a high rate of stocking (four small ruminants per hectare
   per year). This encroachment process throws into relief the role that
   isolated habitats can play as a monitor of land use changes. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{The effects of light year-round cattle grazing on tall-herb fen
   vegetation and wetland molluscs were compared to the effects of
   non-intervention over a period of four years using grazing exclosures.
   The distribution of cattle within the area of fen was investigated by
   plotting the position of the herd at 3-4 day intervals throughout the
   year. Cattle distributed themselves randomly throughout the fen in
   spring, autumn and winter, but showed a more aggregated distribution in
   summer. Grazing reduced the biomass of Phragmites australis and
   increased stem densities of Glyceria maxima, resulting in a shift of
   dominance from Phragmites to Glyceria. Plant species-richness was also
   significantly higher in areas open to grazing.
   Grazing decreased total densities of molluscs and substantially reduced
   densities of the rare snail Vertigo moulinsiana. V. moulinsiana was
   particularly associated with areas of fen that had a high water table
   and high biomass of ungrazed Carex riparia. However, because of the
   patchy nature of the grazing, V. moulinsiana survived at reasonably high
   densities in patches of ungrazed vegetation within the grazing unit. (C)

Title = {{Does fluctuating resource availability increase invasibility? Evidence

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{195-211}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The theory of fluctuating resource availability proposes that the
   susceptibility of a plant community to invasion by new species (i.e.,
   invasibility) depends upon conditions of intermittent resource
   enrichment coinciding with the presence of invading propagules. We
   compared the response of a rapidly invading forb (Hieracium pilosella
   L.) between different experimental treatments in a short tussock
   grassland in New Zealand, over 6-12 years, to determine whether the
   theory explains differences in invasibility. The theory predicts that
   environments subject to periodic resource enrichment will be more
   invasible than those with more stable resource-supply rates. In our
   study, H. pilosella did not increase more rapidly in treatments subject
   to periodic resource pulses (fertiliser and water) than in those with
   more stable resource supplies. Also contrary to the predictions of the
   theory, the rate of invasion of H. pilosella did not increase following
   an increase in the rate of supply of water or nutrient resources, or
   following treatments that temporarily reduced resource uptake in the
   community, including grazing. H. pilosella did not increase immediately
   following abrupt increases in water and nutrient supply and removal of
   the dominant grass species with herbicide, as predicted by the theory,
   although temporary increases in resident exotic guilds indicated that
   the intensity of competition for resources was reduced. Neither H.
   pilosella nor resident exotic guilds showed increased cover growth rates
   following resumed grazing. The rate of invasion by H. pilosella was not
   correlated with species richness, a result consistent with one of the
   predictions of the theory. Therefore, short-lived events that
   temporarily reduced or suspended competition did not appear to determine
   the invasion success of this particular species in this region. In New
   Zealands perennial short tussock grasslands, the characteristics of the
   resident plant community may be more critical than resource fluctuations
   in determining invasion success of H. pilosella. Invasion of H.
   pilosella may be most successfully controlled here by promoting a
   successional physiognomic shift to a taller, shrub-and-tussock-dominated
   canopy that competitively excludes low-growing forbs.}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Effects of atmospheric deposition on natural areas can be mitigated by
   management. For example, the effects of excessive nitrogen deposition
   can partly be overcome by intensifying measures like mowing or sod
   cutting. The costs of this extra management may, in the future, no
   longer be required when deposition rates decrease. We developed a method
   to calculate the costs of the intensified nature management that is
   required at increased deposition rates. We used a set of models that
   simulate the biomass development under different management regimes
   necessary to maintain a certain level of biodiversity. The costs were
   calculated for several vegetation types based on, among others, the
   biomass and litter that was removed. Preliminary results show that the
   models can be applied with some success to assess these costs. Model
   outcomes show a clear effect of management intensity on biomass growth
   in heathland and grassland although no differences were found in forest.
   The biodiversity in heathlands clearly increased when management was
   intensified. As an example, the extra costs in heathlands that are made
   to counteract the effects of atmospheric deposition were calculated for
   The Netherlands. The costs of maintaining heathlands with sods being
   removed from heathlands every 20 years (presently the usual rate) exceed
   those in a situation of sod cutting every 60 years (the expected rate
   without atmospheric deposition) by 1.4 in Euro per year. (c) 2004

Abstract = {{Biological diversity is complex and can be described and quantified in
   various ways. Research exploring the consequences of biodiversity for
   ecosystem functioning has generally focused on the effects of four
   components of biodiversity: species richness and composition, and
   functional group richness and composition. Most of the research to date
   has focused on biodiversity effects within single trophic levels. The
   aim of this study was to compare the relative effects of these four
   components of biological diversity across pond food webs using aquatic
   mesocosm experiments in which all four community properties were
   manipulated independently. Functional groups were defined in terms of
   trophic groups, and consisted of aquatic macrophytes, periphyton
   grazers, and invertebrate predators. Species composition and species
   richness were manipulated within functional groups. Ecosystem response
   variables included the final biomass of the manipulated taxa
   (macrophytes, grazers, and predators), ecosystem rates (productivity and
   decomposition), and trophic structure (phytoplankton and periphyton
   biomass). Results reveal strong effects of species composition on a
   significant proportion of ecosystem response variables. In contrast,
   species richness, functional group richness, and functional group
   composition altered the biomass of the manipulated taxa, but had no
   additional effects on other ecosystem variables. Results suggest that
   the roles of species in ecosystems, when considered in a food web
   context, are often the result of both direct and indirect effects that
   are difficult to predict based on the association of a species to a
   particular functional group. If a goal of biodiversity research is to
   predict the response of ecosystems to biodiversity loss, effects of
   composition and species losses across food webs must be fully integrated
   into biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research.}},

Abstract = {{1. The resource concentration hypothesis predicts that specialist insect

   we found strong negative linear relationships between herbivore loads

Abstract = {{Arthropods living in the canopies of two woody shrub species (a
   sub-shrub (Gutierrezia sarothrae) and a large shrub (Prosopis
   glandulosa)) and perennial grasses plus associated herbaceous species,
   were sampled on 18, 0.5 hectare plots in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland
   for five consecutive years. Mesquite shrubs were removed from nine
   plots, six plots were grazed by yearling cattle in August and six plots
   were grazed in February for the last 3 years of the 5 year study.
   Arthropod species richness ranged between 154 and 353 on grasses, from
   120 to 266 on G. sarothrae, and from 69 to 116 on P. glandulosa. There
   was a significant relationship between the number of families of insects
   on grass and G. sarothrae and growing season rainfall but species
   richness was not a function of growing season rainfall on any of the
   plants. Several of the arthropod families that were the most species
   rich in this grassland were found on all of the plants sampled, i.e.
   Salticid spiders, Bruchid and Curculionid beetles, Cicadellid and
   Psyllid homopterans, and ants (Formicidae). There were more species rich
   families that were shared by grasses and the sub-shrub G. sarothrae than
   with mesquite. The absence of a relationship between growing season
   rainfall and species richness was attributed to variation in life
   history characteristics of arthropods and to the non-linear responses of
   annual and perennial desert grassland plants to rainfall.
   There were no significant differences in insect family or species
   richness on any of the plant types as a result of removal of mesquite
   (P. glandulosa) from selected plots. Intense, short duration (24 h)
   grazing by livestock during in late summer resulted in reduced species
   richness in the grass-herb vegetation layer but had no effect on insect
   species richness on snakeweed or mesquite shrubs. Livestock grazing in
   winter had no effect on insect species richness on any of the vegetation
   sampled. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Different species may respond differently to habitat fragmentation.
   Theory predicts that abundant generalist species should be less affected
   by fragmentation than specialist species. In ant communities, the most
   abundant species is often behaviourally dominant. Thus, habitat
   fragmentation could alter competitive interactions between the dominant
   ant species and the other species. We tested this hypothesis in a
   long-term grassland fragmentation experiment. Fragments of different
   size (20.25 and 2.25 m(-2)) were isolated by a 5-m wide strip of
   frequently mown vegetation. Control plots were situated in adjacent
   undisturbed grassland. Ant density and species composition were assessed
   3 and 6 years after initiation of the experimental fragmentation. The
   effect of the dominant ant species on the resource use of the other
   species was examined at natural sugar resources (aphids and extrafloral
   nectaries) and at artificial sugar baits. Lasius paralienus was the most
   abundant ant species (72\% of nests) in the grasslands examined. Species
   richness and forager density in the other species decreased with
   increasing density of L. paralienus in fragments but not in control
   plots. The overall forager density of the other species was positively
   related to their habitat niche overlap with L. paralienus. The density
   of foragers of the other species at sugar resources was not affected by
   L. paralienus forager density. The experimental fragmentation resulted
   in an increase in natural sugar resources in fragments. This may have
   reduced the intensity of interspecific competition for sugar resources.
   Our study shows that the grassland fragmentation altered interactions
   between the dominant L. paralienus and the other ant species.}},

Abstract = {{Low input grazing-based meat production is often practised on land where
   alternative land use is restricted and where high biodiversity warrants
   specific environmental payments. Although these systems are
   characterized by low external nutrient inputs, significant nutrient
   losses may occur per unit of produce, even though losses per unit area
   are low. If the aim is to have animal production without further
   eutrophication of watercourses, these losses should be minimized,.
   However, if nutrient-poor grasslands characterized by high biodiversity
   are the aim, some losses must be accepted to balance nutrient inputs by
   atmospheric deposition. The impact of grazing animals on nutrient
   dynamics in grasslands is reviewed in this paper, and options to further
   improve nutrient management are discussed. It is concluded that nutrient
   management should largely be addressed indirectly through management of
   animal behaviour in relation to grazing and supplemental feeding, as
   well as through optimization of the seasonal distribution of livestock
   size. A case study indicated that N losses from a cattle farm could be
   reduced considerably by these means, while animal production could
   actually be improved. Sustainability issues and trends in legislative
   and social pressures on low input grazing-based systems of animal
   production are discussed in relation to nutrient management and
   practical recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the potential of forest plantations to support communities
   of forest-using insects when planted into an area with greatly reduced
   native forest cover. We surveyed the insect fauna of Eucalyptus globulus
   (Myrtaceae) plantations and native Eucalyptus marginata dominated
   remnant woodland in south-western Australia, comparing edge to interior
   habitats, and plantations surrounded by a pastoral matrix to plantations
   adjacent to native remnants. We also surveyed insects in open pasture.
   Analyses focused on three major insect orders: Coleoptera, Lepidoptera
   and Hymenoptera. Plantations were found to support many forest-using
   insect species, but the fauna had an overall composition that was
   distinct from the remnant forest. The pasture fauna had more in common
   with plantations than forest remnants. Insect communities of plantations
   were different from native forest both because fewer insect species were
   present, and because they had a few more abundant insect species. Some
   of the dominant species in plantations were known forestry pests. One
   pest species (Gonipterus scutellatus) was also very abundant in remnant
   forest, although it was only recently first recorded in Western
   Australia. It may be that plantation forestry provided an ecological
   bridge that facilitated invasion of the native forest by this nonendemic
   pest species. Plantation communities had more leaf-feeding moths and
   beetles than remnant forests. Plantations also had fewer ants, bees,
   evanioid wasps and predatory canopy beetles than remnants, but predatory
   beetles were more common in the understory of plantations than remnants.
   Use of broad spectrum insecticides in plantations might limit the
   ability of these natural enemies to regulate herbivore populations.
   There were only weak indications of differences in composition of the
   fauna at habitat edges and no consistent differences between the fauna
   of plantations adjacent to remnant vegetation and those surrounded by
   agriculture, suggesting that there is little scope for managing
   biodiversity outcomes by choosing different edge to interior ratios or
   by locating plantations near or far from remnants.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate techniques were used to compare and contrast the effects of
   land cover and farming practice on ground beetle and spider assemblages
   of Scottish farmland. For both ground beetles and spiders, the
   ordination and fuzzy clustering of sites were related to land cover
   rather than geographical location or year of sampling. The same four
   types of land cover group were identified: that is, heather moorland,
   semi-natural grassland, intensive grassland and arable land. The
   robustness of these land cover groups was tested using previously
   unsampled sites and it was found that 79 and 86\% of sites, for ground
   beetle and spider assemblages respectively, were allocated to the land
   cover group predicted from their actual land cover. Furthermore,
   procrustes rotational analysis found a strong relationship between
   ground beetle and spider assemblages in intensively managed sites,
   suggesting that the assemblage structure of one group could be used to
   predict that of the other. The observed relationship between spider and
   ground beetle assemblages does not necessarily indicate that both groups
   were responding to agricultural practices in the same way. Indeed, the
   highest number of beetle species occurred in intensively managed
   grassland and arable sites while the highest number of spider species
   occurred in semi-natural grassland and heather sites. When conducting
   ecological assessments, one might wish to collect information on a wide
   range of ecologically different taxa; however, financial constraints
   make this unfeasible. From the results it could be concluded that
   spiders should be chosen in preference to ground beetles when seeking to
   make predictions on how farming practices influence invertebrates.
   However, such a conclusion would be premature since not only were
   spiders more numerous in the traps, but they were also more time
   consuming to process. In addition, the strong relationship found between
   the spider and ground beetle assemblages further justifies carabids as a
   target group when monitoring the influence of farming practices on
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{As a fine-scale, manipulative model experiment leaf litter was added in
   plots to increase habitat heterogeneity in a 50-year-old Norway spruce
   plantation, established after the clear-cutting of a native beech
   forest, during a 2-year period in the Hungarian Mountain Range. Pitfall
   trap catches of carabids from leaf-litter plots were compared with those
   from control plots to explore the effect of leaf-litter addition.
   Difference in the species composition was revealed by ordination; scores
   of the samples of the two plot types were significantly separated along
   the first MDS axis. The most numerous species (Pterostichus
   oblongopunctatus) was significantly more abundant in the leaf-litter
   plots. However, there were no significant differences for the other most
   frequently obtained species. Habitat generalist species were the most
   abundant, followed by forest generalists, then forest specialists, and
   there were some open habitat species. Enhanced habitat heterogeneity
   (leaf-litter addition) in homogeneous plantations influenced the spatial
   distribution and composition of carabids, through altered abiotic (lower
   ground temperature in the leaf-litter plots) and biotic (more prey
   items) factors. Differences in abundance, species richness and Shannon
   diversity were not significant between the control and the manipulated
   plots, although carabid catch was higher in the leaf-litter plots during
   both years. Forestry practices to increase habitat heterogeneity should
   be considered to enhance biodiversity in managed forests.}},

Abstract = {{Epizoochory and endozoochory are well-recognized long-distance seed
   dispersal mechanisms, yet their relative importance has hardly been
   studied before. Here, epiand endozoochory were compared on donkeys
   foraging in a species-rich 100 ha coastal dune ecosystem, through in
   vitro germination of zoochorous material obtained by fur brushing and
   dung collection. We identified 6675 seedlings of 66 plant species,
   covering 20\% of the species recorded in the study area. Of the 66
   species, only 16 occurred in both epiand endozoochory samples,
   demonstrating the complementarity of both dispersal mechanisms. The
   species composition in the zoochory samples reflected a strong
   seasonality, and seedling numbers were partly correlated with species
   abundance in the study area. The non-zoochorously dispersed species in
   the study area differed from the zoochorous species in seed size and
   weight, plant height, life span, dispersal strategy and seedbank
   persistence. Dispersal-relevant plant traits were used to derive
   dispersal-functional plant types for all species in the study area.
   Epizoochory showed to be more specific than endozoochory and was
   associated with a more narrow range of dispersal-functional plant types.}},

   5,149 worker ants; 80\% of all individuals belonged to three dominant
   species: Messor andrei (Mayr), Pheidole californica Mayr, and Solenopsis
   xyloni McCook. Ant species richness was negatively affected by grazing
   on nonserpentine soils only. In general, soil chemistry and texture
   formed the most consistent associations with the ant community. Plants
   were less important than soil attributes in explaining variation in
   overall ant species richness and abundance, but the abundance of the
   three dominant ant species was significantly correlated with plant
   biomass or plant richness. Based on logistic regression analysis, the
   presence or absence of each dominant ant species was negatively

Abstract = {{1. The movement of native herbivores onto agricultural land is a key
   management issue world-wide as they may compete with domestic livestock
   for pasture and contribute to overgrazing and soil erosion. Eastern grey
   kangaroos Macropus giganteus are viewed as a problem species in
   temperate south-eastern Australia, where high-density populations in
   reserves encroach on nearby farmland.
   2. This study examined home range size and use in M. giganteus across
   different types of land use and in relation to population density and
   pasture availability.
   3. Farmland adjacent to either radiata pine plantations or reserves
   supporting high-density populations of M. giganteus was subject to
   frequent incursions by kangaroos moving onto farmland to rest or graze.
   However, animals from reserves moved on average only 135 m onto farms.
   4. Home ranges of M. giganteus were significantly smaller in the
   reserves than in farm study sites where population densities were lower.
   At reserve sites, home range size was limited by higher population
   densities and limited opportunity for dispersal across surrounding open
   farmland because of a lack of cover. Home range size was not affected by
   resource availability.
   5. Where suitable vegetation cover occurred on farmland (e.g. woodland
   remnants or scrub), M. giganteus occurred as resident or roving small
   mobs. This may be seen by farmers as a disincentive to preserve remnant
   vegetation as it can provide habitat for unwanted native wildlife.
   6. Home range attributes of M. giganteus suggest the species could be
   controlled by culling. However, recolonization occurs quickly and little
   is known of dispersal.
   7. Synthesisandapplications. Population density, presence of cover and
   reluctance to disperse across cleared landscapes are key factors
   influencing kangaroo home range size and use of adjacent farmland.
   Currently, little incentive exists for farmers to preserve remnant
   vegetation, as it may be regarded as providing habitat for unwanted or
   `pest' kangaroos. Given the potential importance of remnant vegetation
   on private land for the conservation of plants and other species of
   wildlife, government incentives and compensation programmes may be
   required to limit land clearing on farms and to encourage improved
   pasture management.}},

Abstract = {{Question: What are the grazing effects in the spatial organization and
   the internal structure of high and low cover patches from a two-phase
   vegetation mosaic?
   Location: Patagonian steppe, Argentina.
   Methods: We mapped vegetation Under three different grazing conditions:
   ungrazed, lightly grazed and heavily grazed. We analysed the spatial
   patterns of the dominant life forms. Also. in each patch type. we
   determined density, species composition. richness, diversity, size
   structure and dead biomass of grasses under different grazing
   conditions.
   Results: The vegetation was spatially organized in a two-phase mosaic.
   High cover patches resulted from the association of grasses and shrubs
   and low cover patches were represented by scattered tussock grasses on
   bare ground. This spatial organization was not affected by grazing, but
   heavy Grazing changed the grass species involved in high cover patches
   and reduced the density and cover of grasses in both patch types.
   Species richness and diversity in high cover patches decreased under
   grazing conditions, whereas in low cover patches it remained unchanged.
   Also, the decrease of palatable grasses was steeper in high cover
   patches than in low cover patches under grazing conditions.
   Conclusions: We suggest that although grazing promotes or inhibits
   particular species, it does not modify the mosaic structure of
   Patagonian steppe. The fact that the mosaic remained unchanged after 100
   years of grazing suggests that grazing does not compromize population
   processes involved in maintaining patch structure, including seed
   dispersal, establishment or biotic interactions among life forms.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{This study analyses changes in the landscape of a sector of Upper
   Franconia (Bavaria, Germany) by comparing land use changes over four
   time periods (1850, 1900, 1960, 2000). Geodetic and other data derived
   from the Bavarian real estate tax and land register were entered into
   various temporal layers of a land register-based vector GIS. This
   multitemporal GIS permits a precise analysis of the historical structure
   and development of landscapes on the basis of land plots.
   In 1850, the study area was almost exclusively agricultural in
   structure. Woodlands made up only 18\% of the total surface. Rough
   pastures and wastelands, which covered about 9\% of the total surface,
   were used for grazing. During the first half of the 20th century, the
   proportion of wooded areas increased considerably. The rough pastures
   that had formerly been a typical feature of the region nearly
   disappeared during this period. Agricultural use declined to less than
   50\% of the total area. In the course of the period between 1960 and
   2000, the livestock industry has become an almost exclusively indoor
   activity. Village development has started spilling over into the
   adjacent fields. The causes and background of these changes are
   discussed in detail.
   From an ecological standpoint, the land use categories surveyed in this
   analysis of landscape change can be regarded as vegetation types,
   thereby constituting habitats for specialized biota. The intensity and
   frequency of any type of land use creates a certain disturbance regime,
   which disrupts and controls the succession in a certain way. The concept
   of categories of change incorporated into the GIS helps to evaluate
   these habitat types and the rate of change more accurately, e.g. for
   nature conservation purposes.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of small-scale fragmentation on the above-ground plant
   biomass was examined in nutrient-poor calcareous grasslands in the
   northern Swiss Jura mountains in three successive years. In the same
   field experiment, the fragmentation effect on the below-ground plant
   biomass was evaluated in I year. Additionally, species richness and
   abundance of plants were recorded. The experimental set-up consisted of
   12 blocks with 48 fragments (24 small, 12 medium and 12 large) and 48
   corresponding control plots distributed over three study sites.
   Fragmentation was maintained by frequently mowing the area between the
   fragments. Three to 5 years after the beginning of the experiment, plant
   biomass was harvested in all fragments and control plots in late autumn
   every year. In general, fragments contained more above- and below-ground
   plant biomass than control plots. The increase in above-ground plant
   biomass was partly due to an increased density of plants, and partly due
   to a change in species composition in fragments. In particular, a
   competitive shift of dominance towards tall grasses and forbs at the
   expense of smaller forbs was observed. Beside the main fragmentation
   effect on above-ground plant biomass, interactive effects with year of
   investigation, study site and plot size were found. This indicates that
   the observed fragmentation effect is a combined result of various
   factors acting to a different extent at different sites and plot sizes.
   The fragmentation-related increase in plant productivity could affect
   higher trophic levels such as herbivore and predator communities. (C)

Abstract = {{The integration of forage crops in an alley-cropped system was examined
   as a method of encouraging tree planting to increase farm income,
   improve soil quality, and enhance biodiversity on Midwestern U. S.
   farms. Crop and tree performance were evaluated in an alley-cropped
   system using four forage intercrops grown in tree alleyways to simulate
   a potential hay crop - oat ( Avena sativa L.) and red clover ( Trifolium
   pratense L.); oat, red clover, and red fescue (Festuca rubra L.); oat,
   red clover, and orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.); and oat and hairy
   vetch ( Vicia villosa Roth) - compared to a herbicide, mowing and
   control ( no management) treatment. Five tree species, divided into
   fast-growing hardwoods of two poplar ( Populus spp.) clones {[} Crandon
   ( P. alba L. x P. grandidentata Michx.) and Eugenei ( P. deltoids Bartr.
   x P. nigra L.)], and silver maple ( Acer saccharinum L.) were compared
   with two high-value, slow-growing hardwoods planted from seed and as
   seedlings: red oak ( Quercus rubra L.) and black walnut (Juglans nigra
   L.). Tree survival in the first year was greater for the fast-growing
   species, and by the fourth year, tree height among the four forage
   treatments was equivalent for all upland locations. The oat/hairy vetch
   ground cover was associated with the shortest trees in the bottomland
   site. Herbicide-treated trees were taller than the average of the four
   forage treatments for all four planting conditions. Tree height in the
   mowing and the control treatments was not significantly different for
   all four planting conditions. The nutritive value of the forage crop was
   excellent in the second year of tree establishment, with crude protein
   content and digestibility at 17 and 71\%, respectively, in the oat/red
   clover/red fescue treatment, suggesting the viability of forage crops as
   alternatives to herbicides in alley-cropped systems.}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was established in an area of long- grazed temperate
   grassland on the Northern Tablelands of New South Wales to investigate
   individual species response to mechanical soil disturbance and nutrient
   enrichment. Grazing was excluded for the duration of the experiment. The
   total species pool available in the experiment included 56 native and 24
   exotic species recorded in the plots, as well as seven exotic species
   that were artificially introduced ( i. e. sowing treatment). Eighteen
   months after treatment, total species richness was significantly lower
   under high soil disturbance ( mean of 14.7 +/- 0.85 species m(-2)) than
   under low ( 21.1 +/- 0.67 species m(-2)) and moderately ( 21.7 +/- 0.77
   species m(-2)) disturbed conditions. Total species richness was not
   significantly affected by nutrient enrichment or sowing. Most of the
   annuals analysed were exotic and their relative cover increased with
   nutrient enrichment ( Aira cupaniana Guss., Briza minor L. and Vulpia
   spp.), but was unresponsive to soil disturbance. Perennials showed
   varied responses, with the abundance of most decreasing with high soil
   disturbance and being unaffected by moderate soil disturbance levels.
   All four perennials favoured by high soil disturbance were exotic (
   Dactylis glomerata L., Lolium perenne L., Hypochaeris radicata L. and
   Sanguisorba minor Scop.); three of these were sown. Most perennials
   showed no significant response to nutrient enrichment, although the
   occurrence of a small number was either reduced ( Aristida ramosa R.
   Br., A. warburgii Mez., H. radicata and S. minor) or increased ( Carex
   inversa R. Br., D. glomerata, Fimbristylis dichotoma ( L.) Vahl.,
   Sporobolus creber De Nardi and Tricoryne elatior R. Br.). Most
   interactions ( i. e. species response to one experimental factor depends
   on another experimental factor) occurred because few individuals
   survived on the severely soil- disturbed plots to respond to nutrient
   enrichment. However, in this particular grassland, the short- term
   response of most species to soil disturbance was independent of the
   level of nutrient enrichment.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE}},

Pages = {{369-382}},
Abstract = {{Declining grassland productivity is a major concern in southern
   temperate Australia. Continuous grazing is thought to be a primary
   contributor to this decline, which is associated with the loss of
   perennial grasses. Landholders are evaluating grazing management
   strategies that might curb the loss of perennials and increase
   long-termproductivity. This study reports on a comparison between
   continuous grazing and time-control grazing with sheep and cattle using
   a paired-paddock design at 5 locations in south-eastern Australia (lat.
   30 - 42 degrees S) over 6 years ( 1994 - 99). Pasture herbage mass,
   grassland species composition and basal cover of perennial grasses were
   assessed at 6-monthly intervals. Species abundance data were analysed by
   ANOVA, ordination (multi-dimensional scaling) and splining procedures to
   assess comparative trends between the 2 management treatments at each
   site. Species were categorised into major functional groups for
   analysis. Over all 5 sites there were few consistent differences between
   management treatments ( continuous grazing v. time-control grazing).
   Basal cover was greater on the time-control grazing management compared
   with continuous grazing for most of the experimental period at 3 sites,
   but the initial values were also greater, resulting in a non-significant
   management x time interaction. Based on this study, we conclude that
   there was no apparent medium-term benefit of a multi-paddock rotational
   ( time-control grazing) grazing system over continuous grazing for
   encouraging and maintaining a favourable botanical composition. The
   benefits for land managers from employing systems such as time-control
   grazing may accrue through other mechanisms. The study also highlights
   some of the difficulties with conducting on-farm paired-paddock
   research.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and species richness of the germinable seed content of
   dung of free ranging horses was quantified and related to seven
   variables: plant species abundance in the field (cover) and in the horse
   diet, seed sizes (length, width and mass), seed longevity index and seed
   shape which was expressed as variance in seed dimensions. Analyses were
   run both across species, with species treated as independent data
   points, and for 40 `phytogenetically independent contrasts'.
   From 56 dung samples, 2.5l each, 53,493 seedlings emerged, representing
   106 different plant species, i.e. 21.4\% of all. species recorded in the
   established vegetation of the study sites. A majority of plant species
   (50\%) was only found in less than 10\% of the dung samples while 68\%
   of the germinating species emerged with on average less than 1 seedling
   per dung sample. Overall. dung seed density ranged on average between
   280.4 and 525.2 seedlings per Litre. Mean species richness of dung
   samples varied between 19 and 34 plant species. Urtica dioica, Veronica
   spp. and several graminoid species were among the most abundant and
   frequently out of dung emerging plant taxa. Dung seed content was
   positively correlated with plant species abundance in the field and in
   the diet. Relative dung seed density (i.e. per unit cover) was
   positively correlated with seed longevity index and negatively
   correlated with all three seed size variables. There was no significant
   relationship with seed shape. These relationships were not affected by
   phylogenetic constraints.
   As far as the possible role of endozoochory for conservation of plant
   diversity in grassland is concerned, the results emphasise the
   importance of large herbivores as potentially strong seed dispersal

Abstract = {{This article, analyses the mechanisms behind changes in agricultural
   land use. Intensification of land use on the one hand, and abandonment

   developments have been determining the changes in agricultural land use.
   In Western Europe, the rapid increase in the opportunity costs of tabour
   was the main factor behind mechanisation and intensification of
   agriculture. Also, the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU has
   stimulated intensification. Recent policy developments have cut down
   important incentives for further intensification. This, however, does
   not solve the problem of the decline of low input agricultural systems

Abstract = {{In Belgium, most calcareous grassland relics are associated with
   Devonian limestone substrates in the Viroin valley, which is part of the
   Calestienne region. Previously grazed by sheep, these grasslands are
   characterised by an extremely high species richness and many rare plant

   classification and an ecological description of the relics of these
   grasslands do not exist.
   In spring and summer of 2003, the calcareous grassland vegetation on
   Devonian limestone hills in the Viroin valley was inventoried. A total
   of 401 vegetation releves were established in 1 m(2) plots. Based on
   classification and ordination techniques seven vegetation types were
   distinguished. The main differences in species composition were
   explained by a gradient from xerophilous towards mesophilous
   environmental characteristics. The particular phytosociological and
   phytogeographical position of the calcareous grasslands in the Viroin
   valley is further discussed in a European context. Mesophilous
   calcareous grasslands in the Calestienne belong to the Mesobromion and
   show an intermediate position between the central European and the
   Atlantic calcareous grassland communities. The xerophilous calcareous
   grassland communities on the other hand show strong affinities with the

Abstract = {{Mycetophilids is a species-rich insect group for which the ecological
   requirements in temperate forests are poorly understood. This study of
   mycetophilids was based on trap samples from 15 oak-dominated sites in
   the boreonemoral zone of southern Sweden. Species richness and
   composition were analysed in relation to environmental variables at a
   local and at larger scales (multiple regression), and compared to
   results from similar studies in spruce-dominated sites in the boreal
   zone of Norway (PCA and two-sample t tests). Regressions showing a
   dominance of regional factors over local in-site variables agree with
   species-richness models assuming that local communities most often are
   unsaturated. Precipitation (inter-correlated with elevation) was the
   strongest factor for explaining the variation in species-richness, which
   is consistent with previous results indicating that mycetophilids are
   disfavoured by drought. In addition to precipitation, the area of mixed
   forest with high biodiversity values (woodland key habitats and
   protected areas) was a positive factor for species-richness, probably
   because such habitats combine elements of both coniferous and deciduous
   forests. PCA ordination revealed a clear separation of the species
   composition between boreal and boreonemoral forests. Species-richness in
   boreal forest was significantly higher than in boreonemoral forest,
   indicating a preference for boreal habitats in many of the species. For
   mycetophilids and other drought-sensitive insects, it is suggested that
   (partial) cutting in some dense successional oak stands should be
   avoided, and that some invading spruces should be tolerated. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Management of argali in Mongolia historically has been tied to improving
   biological research and anti-poaching activities within the framework of
   trophy hunting. Argali populations in protected areas, where trophy
   hunting does not occur, have received little attention. and conservation
   or management plans for these areas generally do not exist. In this
   study, results from interviews with pastoralists in Siilkhemiin Nuruu
   National Park in western Mongolia indicate that local people revere
   argali and are generally aware of and support government protections,
   but may not be inclined to reduce herd sizes or discontinue grazing
   certain pastures for the benefit of wildlife without compensation.
   Because past protectionist approaches to argali conservation in western
   Mongolia and the greater Altai-Sayan ecoregion have not achieved
   effective habitat conservation or anti-poaching enforcement, alternative
   management policies should be considered. Results from this study
   suggest local receptiveness to management programs based on community
   involvement and direct benefit. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The productivity of grasslands depends in part on their diversity of
   species and functional composition. Our objective was to examine the
   effects of three landscape positions (summit, backslope, and toe- slope)
   and three stocking systems (continuous, rotational, and non- grazed) on
   species diversity and percentage of cover of grass, legume, and weed
   species functional types in southeastern Iowa pastures. Data were
   collected in 0.2-m(2) plots randomly distributed throughout each of four
   replicate pastures in spring and summer 2000 and 2001. Backslope
   landscape positions within pastures managed with either continuous or
   rotational stocking contained the greatest overall diversity of species.
   Across years, overall species richness under grazing averaged 4.8 on
   backslopes, 3.5 on summits, and 2.9 on toeslopes. Legume cover was
   greatest within the rotational stocking system, averaging 21\% on
   backslopes, 10\% on summits, and 3\% on toeslopes across years.
   Cool-season grasses dominated summits and toeslopes, consisting of 88 to
   94\% of the cover. Weed species diversity and cover were greatest on
   backslopes within the continuous stocking system. Our results showed
   that rotational stocking had more desirable effects through greater
   legume cover and less weed cover on backslopes than continuous stocking.
   This research suggested that spatial components of pastures should be
   considered to optimize the production and quality of forage for grazing
   livestock.}},

Title = {{Are invasive species the drivers or passengers of change in degraded

Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{42-55}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Few invaded ecosystems are free from habitat loss and disturbance,
   leading to uncertainty whether dominant invasive species are driving
   community change or are passengers along for the environmental ride. The
   ``driver{''} model predicts that invaded communities are highly
   interactive, with subordinate native species being limited or excluded
   by competition from the exotic dominants. The ``passenger{''} model
   predicts that invaded communities are primarily structured by
   noninteractive factors (environmental change, dispersal limitation) that
   are less constraining on the exotics, which thus dominate. We tested
   these alternative hypotheses in an invaded, fragmented, and
   fire-suppressed oak savanna. We examined the impact of two invasive
   dominant perennial grasses on community structure using a reduction
   (mowing of aboveground biomass) and removal (weeding of above- and
   belowground biomass) experiment conducted at different seasons and soil
   depths. We examined the relative importance of competition vs. dispersal
   limitation with experimental seed additions. Competition by the
   dominants limits the abundance and reproduction of many native and
   exotic species based on their increased performance with removals and
   mowing. The treatments resulted in increased light availability and bare
   soil; soil moisture and N were unaffected. Although competition was
   limiting for some, 36 of 79 species did not respond to the treatments or
   declined in the absence of grass cover. Seed additions revealed that
   some subordinates are dispersal limited; competition alone was
   insufficient to explain their rarity even though it does exacerbate
   dispersal inefficiencies by lowering reproduction. While the net effects
   of the dominants were negative, their presence restricted woody plants,
   facilitated seedling survival with moderate disturbance (i.e.,
   treatments applied in the fall), or was not the primary limiting factor
   for the occurrence of some species. Finally, the species most
   functionally distinct from the dominants (forbs, woody plants) responded
   most significantly to the treatments. This suggests that relative
   abundance is determined more by trade-offs relating to environmental
   conditions (long-term fire suppression) than to traits relating to
   resource capture (which should most impact functionally similar
   species). This points toward the passenger model as the underlying cause
   of exotic dominance, although their combined effects (suppressive and
   facilitative) on community structure are substantial.}},

Abstract = {{Above- and belowground herbivores promote plant diversity when

   explained by differences in plant preference between the aboveground-

   few highly abundant species. As above- and belowground invertebrate

Pages = {{183-191}},
Abstract = {{The search for general plant community patterns that explain plant
   responses to land use changes is at present a major focus of studies
   related to grassland conservation. Traditionally, vegetation change has
   been documented by identifying species-based changes over time. Recent
   studies suggest that species-based assessments should be complemented
   with functional assessments of species characteristics. We examined land
   use change along a successional gradient by comparing grasslands with
   long grazing history, abandoned formerly grazed grasslands, and pastures
   with a short grazing history by using i) species data, i.e., species
   richness, composition, growth form, and homogenization, and ii)
   functional characteristics, using three core traits, seed mass, specific
   leaf area (SLA), and plant height. Analyzing species data directly in
   terms of species richness, composition, or growth form was a more
   straightforward tool than analyzing species function based on selected
   core traits. No functional groups, based on the investigated traits,
   were supported. Functional response trends were, however, detected, as
   height increased and SLA decreased along the successional gradient.
   Analyses based on species data followed documented response patterns
   associated with grassland succession, i.e., decrease in species
   richness, decrease in the number of plant species favoured by grazing,
   and shifts in species composition and growth form towards less dominance
   of herbs. Due to idiosyncrasy of individual species responses, we
   question the benefit of using a small number of response traits or
   functional groupings compared to species-based analyses for documenting
   vegetation changes in grazing systems over time.}},

Abstract = {{From April 1995 to November 1997 the following investigation was carried
   out on 62.7 ha of the nature reserve `Limburg' (48.36 N/9.23E): data on
   the type and frequency of grassland use was collected and mapped as well
   as data on the carabid fauna. 17 sample plots were selected. Parts of
   the plots have had 25 years of unchanged management regimes.
   The regimes included three-cutting meadows (3), two-cutting meadows (3),
   mulched meadows (4), abandoned meadows (3), a horse pasture, a sheep
   pasture with rotational grazing, a continuously grazed sheep pasture,
   and a sheep pasture which had been abandoned in 1994. 5229 beetles
   representing 68 Carabidae species were caught in pitfall traps during
   the three years of investigation, 18 species (26\%) could only be
   verified by one single individium. Meadows cut once or twice a year did
   not differ substantially from pastures regarding their mean number of
   species. But these three management forms show a significant higher
   number of species compared to mulched meadows or abandoned plots. The
   number of species on sample plots diminishes with decreasing land use
   intensity. The carabid species caught were divided into 5 classes
   according to their size: Large species (SCI, SC II) held percentages
   between 6 and 29\% and between 0 and 29\% respectively. Medium-sized and
   smaller species (SC III, SC IV) were more abundant with 8-54\% and
   15-63\%. Very small species (SC V) were less frequent 0-19\%. The
   percentage of large species increased along the gradient of land use
   intensity, while the percentage of medium-sized species decreased. Two
   classes were built regarding the food preferences of carabids:
   Phytohagous species held percentages between 14 and 41\%, predominantly
   zoophagous species between 54 and 86\%. The distribution of food
   preferences does not show any land use-specific influence. Three
   discriminant functions on the basis of 20 characters (variables) of the
   carabid assemblage were extracted, which significantly separated the
   carabid assemblages from the live groups of management forms. The
   ecological characteristics of the assemblages in the orchard habitat are
   quite different.}},

Abstract = {{Epizoochorous dispersal of plant seeds is an important long-distance
   dispersal mechanism. Yet little is known about retention times of seeds

   depletion curves on Galloway cattle and Haflinger horse in three
   vegetation types (forest, tall herbage vegetation and meadow), in both
   dry and rainy weather conditions. In the long fur of Galloway cattle,
   seeds were retained significantly longer than in the short fur of
   Haflinger horse. In general, seed retention times were not considerably
   affected by the structure of the surrounding vegetation. The impact of
   the weather was negligible, only affecting the retention of some plant
   species. Negative exponential functions were fitted to the seed
   depletion curves. Using the parameters of curve estimations in the
   different conditions of animal species and vegetation structure,
   half-life seed retention times of up to 13 h for Galloway cattle and up
   to more than 4 h for Haflinger horse could be calculated, with
   corresponding potential half-life dispersal distances in the order of
   magnitude of tens of metres to a few kilometres. Different seed traits

   A stand overgrazed by domestic geese and a reference stand void of
   overgrazing were compared. Apart from this both stands were accidentally
   grazed by cattle, Vegetation of the overgrazed stand was significantly
   more species-rich, especially in summer annuals. The reference was
   dominated with perennials and winter annuals. Composition and dominance
   changed considerably at both stands but only composition became more
   alike. Declining species richness and increasing dominance of perennials
   was found in the overgrazed stand. The reference stand became dominated
   with the dwarf-shrub Thymus degenianus. Species richness or the
   overgrazed stand showed greater seasonal and year-to-year variation than
   that of the reference. No temporal change of nutrient availability was
   found and neither was a difference detected between the stands.
   Greenhouse germination revealed more dense and more species-rich seed
   bank in the overgrazed stand. Its established vegetation and soil seed
   bank were also more alike. Higher species richness of the overgrazed
   stand can be associated with intensive propagule dispersal of geese, as
   indicated by den-se seed banks of zoochorous hygrophytes delivered from
   neighbouring wetlands. Relatively high representation of persistent seed
   bank records suggests that, except for some sensitive perennials, the
   studied community is adapted to recurrent disturbances, Community
   regeneration seems to be limited by slow spread of perennial graminoids.

Abstract = {{Eaphrasia stricta var. suecica, E. stricta var. tennis, and Rhinanthus
   serotinus subsp. vernalis are three endangered, hemiparasitic annual
   herbs found in traditionally managed hay meadows on Gotland, Sweden. We
   have studied - experimentally and in the field - how some features in
   the present and traditional management cycle affect their fitness.
   We set up permanent 50 X 50-cm plots in a coastal hay meadow where both
   E. stricta var. suecica and Rhinanthus are still quite common. The
   survival, growth and fecundity of cohorts of Euphrasia and Rhinanthus
   were followed throughout the growing season for three years. The length
   of the growing season was vital for Euphrasia and Rhinanthus
   performance. In cooler summers, the percentage of Eaphrasia individuals
   that produced mature seeds was decreased by 20\% at the time of mowing.
   This indicates the need to individually adjust the time of mowing, as
   was formerly done, to the actual phenological development in order to
   maintain healthy populations. It is also important to consider the
   effect of time of mowing on total species richness, as Eaphrasia more
   successfully established in 10 X 10-cm squares with high species
   richness.
   Also, the time in spring when hemiparasite growth started was crucial.
   Cohorts of both Eaphrasia stricta var. suecica and Rhinanthus that
   connected to hosts and started growing early in the season had a strong
   advantage over later cohorts by having fitness values four to eight
   times higher. From this we conclude that the traditional practice of
   spring raking is important for the long-term persistence of these
   hemiparasites, since raking promotes an earlier onset of both host and
   hemiparasite growth.
   Another important issue is the traditional, but nowadays often neglected
   practice of letting the hay dry in the meadow after mowing. Hay that was
   left to dry in the meadow contributed significantly more Rhinanthus seed
   to the meadow than hay that was taken away immediately after mowing.
   We also found that seedling emergence and subsequent growth of Euphrasia
   stricta var. suecica was greatly enhanced by a second hay cut in
   September. A second cutting mimics some of the positive effects of the
   traditional practice of aftermath grazing, which is nowadays often
   abandoned.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic disturbance in Amazonian forests has increased
   dramatically since the early 1980s and forest disturbance is expected to
   continue in the early twenty-first century. Logging and conversion to
   pasture for cattle are two of the largest causes of forest disturbance
   and destruction. This study examined the distribution and diversity of
   dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabacidae) in intact forest and under three
   disturbance regimes (selective logging, clear-cutting and pasture) in a
   forest tract in southern Para state, Brazil. Dung beetles were collected
   using facces-baited pitfall traps, then identified, measured and
   weighed. Principal Components Analyses and the Sorensen's Index
   indicated that the intact and selectively logged areas were similar in
   terms of species composition but that the pasture areas and clear-cut
   areas had substantially different groups of species. Beetle size and
   diversity (as measured by species richness, Shannon index and Simpson's
   index) were lower in clear-cuts and pasture than in intact forest. The
   selectively logged forest was no less diverse than intact forest. and
   beetles were the same size or larger than those in intact forest. Total
   beetle biomass, however, was highest in the pasture due to the abundance
   of small-bodicd beetles in this habitat. While the fact that selective
   logging has a relatively minor impact on the dung beetle community is
   heartening, the projected increase in the amount of highly disturbed
   landscape in Amazonia is expected to have a severe impact on dung beetle
   biodiversity in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation was sampled in kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides)-dominant
   forest fragments having different recovery periods since grazing ceased

   were modeled against recovery periods ranging from 0-74 y and in
   relation to position within fragment (edge or interior). Indigenous
   plant species richness increased and adventive plant species (mostly
   pasture herbs) richness declined with increasing recovery period; small
   tree and sapling density and seedling ground cover increased. Fragment
   edges had higher adventive species richness, lower basal area, more
   established seedlings, lower litter cover and higher grass ground cover,
   than interior plots. Some indigenous species (e.g. Laurelia
   novaezealandiae and Myrsine australis) increased with recovery period
   while some adventive species (e.g. Solanum pseudocapsicum) declined. The
   relative basal area of Alectryon excelsus increased significantly with
   recovery period at edges, and that of Melicytus ramiflorus everywhere.
   Twenty years represents a turning point in the recovery period, with the
   end of the loss phase of adventive pasture species, the start of the
   re-establishment phase of indigenous ground layer and understorey
   species, and significant recovery of population structures of major
   species. In relatively non-weedy rural environments, retirement from

Abstract = {{The Canterbury Plains have lost most of their pre-Polynesian indigenous
   vegetation, primarily forest and shrubland. One of the few remaining
   areas is the 2.3 ha Eyrewell Scientific Reserve which consists mostly of
   low k (a) over bar nuka (Kunzeo ericoides) forest and a small area of
   grassland. We assessed the Reserve vegetation using a combination of
   plots and transect surveys at different times of the year between
   2001-2003. For comparison with the Reserve vegetation we also assessed
   plots in an adjacent grazed k (a) over bar nuka remnant, adjacent
   cultivated pasture and Eyrewell Forest, a pine plantation. Our study of
   the Eyrewell Reserve in 2001-2003 found that since an assessment of the
   Reserve in 1972, 28 indigenous species were no longer present but 14
   indigenous species and 48 adventive species were newly recorded. The
   dramatic invasion of the Reserve is illustrated by the fact that 60\% of
   the 118 species recorded in 2003 were adventives compared to 34\% in
   1972. Despite this invasion and the loss of indigenous species, Reserve
   plots still have more than twice as many species as plots in the
   adjacent pine plantation. The Reserve also included several species of
   high conservation value such as the ``Chronically Threatened{''}
   Leptinella serrulata, and the ``At Risk{''} Aciphylla subflabellata,
   Coprosma intertexta and Pterostylis tristis. Plots in the Reserve
   grassland and adjacent pasture had the lowest percentage of indigenous
   species of all habitat types, with the pasture plots having no
   indigenous vascular plant species. In contrast the understorey of the
   old pine stands had the highest percentage of indigenous species of any
   of the habitats and in places was dominated by k (a) over bar nuka up to
   4 in tall, indicating that these plantations also have conservation
   value. Eyrewell Reserve and the few other remaining k (a) over bar nuka
   remnants in the Canterbury Plains represent an important pool of
   indigenous species for conservation. Options for the future management

   supported mammalian assemblages that were similar in richness and
   diversity to our mature riparian forest site. The mature riparian forest
   site contained four species of small mammals (eastern chipmunks
   {[}Tamias striatus], white-footed mice {[}Peromyscus leucopus], deer
   mice {[}P. maniculatus], and woodland jumping mice {[}Napeozapus

Abstract = {{Plant reproduction can be strongly affected by herbivory and different
   features of pollination ecology, such as pollinator visitation rates and
   capacity for self-pollination. The purpose of this study is to compare
   the relative impact of herbivory and pollination on maternal
   reproductive success in endemic Aquilegia viscosa and its widespread
   congener Aquilegia vulgaris. We conducted herbivore exclusion
   experiments in two populations of each species in 2 different years and
   showed that the maternal fertility of A. viscosa was significantly more
   limited by floral predation and pre-dispersal seed predation than its
   widespread congener. In the absence of herbivory, A. viscosa retained
   significantly lower maternal fertility than A. vulgaris. Experimental
   pollinations in an insect-free glasshouse showed that the two species
   have an equal seed/ovule ratio both in the absence of pollinators and in
   the presence of non-limiting outcross pollination, Pollinator visitation
   rates were significantly higher in populations of A. vulgaris than in
   populations of A. viscosa. In addition, path analyses showed that spur
   length, an important trait for pollinator attraction in Aquilegia, and,
   indirectly sepal and petal width, contribute positively to the
   seed/ovule ratio in A. vulgaris, but not in A. viscosa. These results
   indicate that maternal fertility of endemic A. viscosa is strongly

Title = {{Changes in the species composition and conservation value of limestone

   managements}},

Abstract = {{An experiment was established to assess the long-term effects of six
   different management types on the species composition of dry limestone
   grasslands with the aim of finding an alternative to the traditional
   management (mowing annually in July) which is no longer economically
   viable. In addition to the traditional management (JU1), the following
   management types were applied experimentally for 22 years: mowing every
   2 years in July (JU2), every 5 years (JU5), or not at all (ABN,
   abandonment), mowing annually in October (OCT), and controlled burning
   annually (CBR) at the end of winter. There were two study sites, Grate
   and Gratental, near Schaffhausen in N Switzerland, each with three
   replicate 5 m x 10 m plots for every management. During the course of
   the experiment, the vegetation was recorded on 10 occasions, yielding
   306 vegetation releves containing a total of 124 species. These data
   were analysed using correspondence analyses (CA). In addition, changes
   in the abundance of 16 plant species with high cover, high frequency or
   particular importance for nature conservation were examined in detail.
   The CA showed that the vegetation of the two study sites differed
   considerably, but that in both sites the various management types led to
   changes in floristic composition which were probably continuing even
   after 22 years. At the end of the experiment, on the Grate site, species
   number in comparison to JU1 had declined in the following progressive
   order: OCT, JU2, JU5, CBR, ABN, where it was down to 70\%. At the
   Gratental site, species number showed no clear pattern, because of the
   immigration of `new' species from the surrounding hedges and
   agricultural fields.
   Interestingly, Bromus erectus, the dominant species with a cover of
   40-70\% at the beginning, decreased to 5-30\% under different
   managements, mainly because the regeneration of its tufts is affected by
   abandonment and particularly burning. The rhizomatous Brachypodium
   pinnatum showed the opposite pattern and increased from 5\% to 60\% in
   CBR. Trifolium medium as well as Salvia pratensis, Primula veris and
   other long-lived forbs of high conservation value tended to be favoured
   by OCT, CBR and/or ABN because they can store nutrients if they are not
   annually cut in July.}},

   to eutrophication on the other giving us a basis for future management
   strategies. Five treatments were applied to calcareous grassland in SW
   Slovenia representing different combinations of fertilization and
   grazing regimes. Effects of these two factors along with other
   environmental variables on species composition were evaluated. Trait
   composition of original low-intensity grazed vegetation showed
   importance of stress-tolerance (S component), relatively high abundance
   of small plants, chamaephytes, phalanx strategy and summer green plants.
   Abandonment increased abundance of grasses and suppressed forbs and
   legumes. C component, showing appearance of competitive exclusion,
   increased, resulting in increased average plant height. Fertilization
   promoted the abundance of therophytes and persistent green, mesophyllous
   plant species with guerrilla lateral spread. It also caused significant
   increase in abundance of species expressing ruderality (R component).}},

Pages = {{83-91}},
Abstract = {{Grasslands and their grazers provide some of the most compelling
   examples for studying the relationship between diversity, productivity,
   and disturbance. In this study, we analyzed the impact of
   grazing-induced changes in species composition and community structure
   upon the productivity of a grassland in the Campos region, Uruguay. We
   compared three treatments: a continuously grazed area, a 9-year old
   exclosure to domestic herbivores, and grazing-simulated plots inside the
   exclosure, which were clipped so that their standing biomass resembled
   that of the grazed area. We studied the community composition of the
   grazed and ungrazed situations, and determined biomass and above-ground
   net primary production (ANPP) of the three treatments during 1 year.
   Grazed plots had higher species richness and diversity than the
   exclosure. Grazing resulted in the replacement of some cool-season,
   tussock grasses by warm-season, prostrate grasses. ANPP was 51\% higher
   under grazing than in the exclosure, but the grazing-simulated plots
   inside the exclosure were the most productive treatment, 29\% higher
   than the grazed plots. Thus, two components of grazing effect may be
   postulated for this grassland. The structural component resulted in
   higher ANPP, probably due to the elimination of standing dead biomass.
   The species composition component resulted in lower ANPP once the
   structural component was controlled, probably due to the shift to
   warm-season phenology and prostrate habit. Our findings contrast with a
   similar experiment carried out in the neighbouring Flooding Pampa
   region, which suggests that the relationship between grazing and
   community structure and function is difficult to generalize.}},

   habitats in southern Norway}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{179}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{217-229}},
Abstract = {{Colonisation is often a critical stage in the life history of plants,
   and recruitment success is expected to have a strong impact on plant
   frequencies especially among herbs. Several plant traits (seed size,
   plant height, leaf dry weight and specific leaf area) are suggested to
   be functionally important in early life stages, and the impact of such
   traits is expected to increase with habitat harshness. In this
   comparative study we examine the relative role of different plant traits
   for herb community patterns on both a local and regional scale in two
   contrasting alpine ecosystems in southern Norway: (1) a sub-continental
   region with more dry and productive, base-rich soils (Hol, Hallingdal)
   and (2) an oceanic region, with humid acidic soils (Setesdal).
   Differences in species richness between regions were mainly due to
   higher herb richness in the base-rich region (n=55) than in the acidic
   region (n=13). Among traits, herb species seed weight was higher at the
   acidic site. The relative importance of traits for explaining herb local
   abundance and regional distribution tended to be stronger at the acidic
   site. No trait had a significant effect at the base-rich site, although
   seed weight and seed number were marginally non-significant. Plant
   clonality was positively related to local abundance and marginally to
   regional distribution at the acidic site. Plant frequency-trait
   correlations were generally higher in the acidic region then in the
   base-rich region. There was further a (marginal) increase of herbs with
   large seeds and with a dependence on sexual reproduction with increasing
   pH levels in Hol. Soil pH was also the most important environmental
   variable for herb richness in Hol, while no environmental variable was
   significantly related to herb richness in Setesdal. The study suggests
   that recruitment through seed is critical for the alpine herb community
   patterns especially in harsh habitats. Possible explanations for
   recruitment constraints include both soil acidity (low pH and Ca levels
   in addition to possible aluminium toxicity) and disturbance through
   grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Seed dispersal has become an important issue in plant ecology and
   restoration management. In this paper we examined dung germinating seed
   content and seed deposition patterns of horses (Shetland and Konik
   breeds) and Scottish Highland cattle grazing two coastal dune nature
   reserves. Two times 2.5 l of fresh dung from each type of herbivore were
   collected during seven sessions in the main fruiting season. Dung
   samples were placed under greenhouse conditions after drying and
   cooling. Animal defecation patterns were derived from a study of
   herbivore activities during 6 h observation sessions 8 times a month.
   One hundred and seventeen plant species i.e. 27\% of all species
   occurring in the study area, were recorded as seedlings emerging from
   the dung samples. The most abundantly and frequently recorded plant
   species were Urtica dioica, Juncus spp. and different species of Poaceae
   and Caryophyllaceae. In general seedling density is high (1158
   seedlings/dung sample). Seedling density and species richness were
   further analysed in order to detect temporal variability and possible
   animal and site related characteristics. Dung deposition patterns
   reflect a non-random use of habitats and hence a non-random seed
   deposition among habitats. Calculated seed deposition per square meter
   ranged from a few (<10 germinating seeds) to more than 100 in the most
   frequently selected habitats. From the herbivores' selective habitat use
   and their estimated mean retention time we can further assume their
   ability for inter-habitat endozoochorous seed dispersal. This
   characteristic of large herbivores is further discussed in the light of
   nature management and restoration.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between plant species richness and the space
   organization of the community at different small scales was studied. The
   study was based on 51 sites distributed along a belt from Central Spain
   to Portugal. Each site was analyzed with a transect cutting across the
   boundary between two neighboring patches of shrubland and grassland.
   Local spatial organization of vegetation was analyzed at different
   levels of detail and each transect was divided into successively smaller
   portions. The first division coincides with a physiognomic perception of
   the site in two patches (shrubland and grassland). The average spatial
   niche width of the species was used to calculate the spatial
   organization of the vegetation of each division in each site. The
   correlation between species richness and spatial organization depended
   on the block size under consideration. A physiognomic criterion,
   sectorizing the sites into patches of shrubland and grassland,
   determines noteworthy floristic changes but does not enable us to
   express satisfactorily the variability in plant richness. In order to
   account for this variation, other factors must be taken into account
   which act at a more detailed small-scale and which determine the
   internal variability of these patches. In the case studied, the species
   richness of the sites increases along with an increase in the percentage
   of species whose occupation of the space is relatively restricted within
   the site. Many of these species are, however, frequent within the whole
   of the territory studied. The results highlight the importance of the
   level of local scale at which the factors influencing occupation of the
   space, and consequentially, plant richness, preferentially act. This
   circumstance ought to be taken into consideration in strategies for the
   conservation of biological diversity, and based on the delimitation of
   protected spaces with criteria frequently linked to the physiognomy of
   the vegetation.}},

Title = {{Floristic analysis of the two woodland-meadow ecotones differing in
   orientation of the forest edge}},
Journal = {{POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2005}},
Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{365-382}},
Abstract = {{Studies on the transition zones between Plant communities using the
   statistical method by Matuszkiewicz, have been predominantly conducted
   in forest communities or in ecotones between wetland and meadow
   communities. Although boundaries between forest and meadow (as a result
   of human pressure on the landscape, namely forest fragmentation) are of
   ecological interest, no previous attempts have been made to estimate the
   width of such ecotones using Matuszkiewicz's approach. We applied the
   method in the studies on floristic changes across two, woodland-meadow
   ecotones (Arrhenatheretum elaiioris/Tilio cordatae-Carpinetum betuli
   typicum and Scirpetum sylvatici/Tilio cordatae-Carpinetum betuli
   corydaletosum communities), located at forest edges differing in their
   orientation. The aim of the research was to estimate the width and
   character of-those ecotones and to investigate whether the possible
   differences in vegetation are related to the prevailing aspect
   (orientation) of the woodland edge.
   To characterise the floristic composition of the two adjacent
   communities, the method of Greig-Smith's square (16 quadrats of 4 m(2)
   each) was chosen. To determine the floristic changes across each
   ecotone, transects 38 in in length and formed of 2 x 2 in quadrats were
   set perpendicularly to the woodland-meadow boundary. Diagnostic species
   for the main communities were determined and their incidence along the
   transect was observed.
   Differences in species composition that were observed along the
   transects allowed us to distinguish three contrasting sectors. The first
   one represents typical meadow communities, the second sector represents
   a typical ecotone, and the third one contains typical woodland
   communities.
   Our results showed that the width of the ecotones differed depending on
   the orientation of the woodland edge. In the transect between
   Arrhenatheretum elatioris and Tilio cordatae-Carpinetum betuli typicum
   communities, situated on a SE-oriented forest edge, it was estimated at
   10 in, whereas in the second transect, the transition zone between the
   Scirpetum sylvatici and Tilio cordatae-Carpinetum betuli corydaletosum
   was narrower, reaching 6 in. This was located on a NW-oriented woodland
   edge. Our observations confirm the results of many other studies, which
   show that transition zones between woodland and meadow are wider on
   edges that receive more light, than in north-facing ones. The
   differences in the size of the transition zone at the two study sites
   are clear despite the fact that the two types of meadow communities
   differed in the number of mowing cycles per season. The Arrhenatheretum
   elatioris community is mown twice a year, and its ecotone with the
   woodland is wider than in the case of the Scirpetum sylvatici community.
   The latter is mown only once in the vegetation season but its transition
   zone remains 4 in narrower than in the first situation. It seemed that
   the increase in vegetation management (two mowing cycles instead of one)
   did not contribute to the reduced width of the ecotone.
   When looking at the distribution of species representing different
   syntaxonomic groups, in both transects, no meadow plants from the
   Moplinio-Arrhenatheretea class or other species of open habitats were
   recorded deeper than 6 in into the woodland interior. On the other hand,
   forest species from the Querco-Fagetea class were found much further
   into the area of meadow. Thus, no strong pressure of meadow communites
   on woods was recorded, but the opposite situation, where forest species
   extended into the meadow area, took place. Such a tendency was observed
   regardless of the aspect of the woodland edge.
   Differences in physiological amplitude of species allowed us to
   distinguish, after Ranney et al. (1981), a group of meadow-oriented
   species, which neither occurred in ecotone nor woodland, strongly
   edge-oriented species, and strongly forest interior-oriented species,
   avoiding the ecotones and meadows. A group of species present along the
   whole transect (ubiquitous) was very poorly represented.

Abstract = {{The main trends in spontaneous regeneration were studied in old-fields
   in the Transylvanian Lowland (Campia Transilvaniei) over a period of 40
   years using the chronosequence method. Succession proceeds to grassland,
   because the establishment of woody vegetation is hindered by grazing and
   mowing of the old-fields and by the scarcity of woodlands in the
   vicinity. Community properties and population-level changes were
   recorded at different stages of succession and compared with
   semi-natural grassland in the surrounding landscape. Due to favourable
   soil conditions and temperate climate, vegetation cover develops quickly
   after the fields are abandoned. Annuals dominated only in the first
   year. After two years the fast growing clonal grass, Elymus repens,
   became dominant. After approximately 12 years, Elymus was replaced by
   Festuca rupicola, which is more resistant to stress and disturbance. In
   the later stages of succession various species, some typical of
   surrounding grassland, attained high cover values. A steady increase in
   species diversity, measured by the Shannon index, and richness was
   recorded at both the field (1.0-2.5 ha) and plot (4 x 4 in) scales.
   Species richness increased rapidly in early and middle stages and
   stabilized after the 14th year. Specific features of the succession in
   the old-fields in the Transylvanian Lowland can be attributed to the
   continued grazing and mowing of the fields after they are abandoned.
   This increases species richness because it arrests succession at a stage
   when species diversity is high. The management directs regeneration
   towards secondary grassland rather than species poor woodland.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we analyze the complexity of plant spatial patterns and
   diversity along a successional gradient resulting from grazing
   disturbance in four characteristic ecosystems of the Mediterranean
   region. Grazing disturbance include not only defoliation by animals, but
   also associated disturbances as animal trampling, soil compaction, and
   mineralization by deposition of urine and feces. The results show that
   woodland and dense matorral are more resistant to species loss than
   middle dense and scattered matorral, or grassland. Information fractal
   dimension declined as we moved from a dense to a discontinuous matorral,
   increasing as we moved to a more scattered matorral and a grassland. In
   all studied cases, the characteristic species of the natural vegetation
   declined in frequency and organization with grazing disturbance.
   Heliophyllous species and others with postrate or rosette twigs
   increased with grazing pressure, particularly in dense matorral. In the
   more degraded ecosystem, only species with well-adapted traits, e.g.,
   buried buds or unpalatable qualities showed a clear increase with
   grazing. Indeed, the homogeneity of species distribution within the
   plant community declined monotonically with grazing impact. Conversely,
   the spatial organization of the characteristic plants of each community
   increased in the better-preserved areas, being also related to the
   sensitivity of the species to grazing impact. The degree of
   autocorrelation of plant spatial distribution at the species level and
   the information fractal dimension at the community level allow us to
   quantify the degree of degradation of natural communities and to
   determine the sensitivity of key species to disturbance. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Composition and structure of macroinvertebrate communities were
   documented in relation to hydrochemical variables over a 10-month period
   in four headwater tributaries of the Futaleufu River, northwestern

   gradient that decreases from west to east and they have different basin
   features. At Blanco and Baggilt streams, riparian vegetation consisted
   primarily of native Nothofagus forest, while in the Nant y Fall and
   Rifleros, basins with a long legacy of domestic grazing, the introduced
   Salix fragilis was the dominant riparian species. Macroinvertebrate
   species richness, density, and biomass were similar among rivers;
   however, biomass of shredders was highest in the Nothofagus forested
   streams and collector-filterers were significantly higher in Salix
   fragilis-bordered rivers. Water temperatures were higher in non-native
   Salix sites than in the native or mixed forested sites. Canonical
   community analysis indicated community composition was related to
   geomorphic attributes of the rivers, especially slope, basin height
   (elevation change), distance to the source, substratum size, and Salix
   coverage. Moreover, seasonally dynamic variables, rainfall and water
   temperature were good community predictors. Land-use change (conversion
   from Nothofagus to pastures and the Salix fragilis invasion in the
   riverbanks of pasture-dominated catchments) was interactive with natural
   stream attributes as determinants of macroinvertebrate distribution and

Abstract = {{When Hungary, together with nine other central and eastern European
   countries. enters the European Union in 2004 two major threats will
   arise to the birds inhabiting agricultural landscapes. Marginal
   agricultural land may be abandoned, while the remaining area may suffer
   from intensification. To assess the effects of these threats breeding
   birds were monitored in abandoned, extensively and intensively used
   vineyards and grasslands in Hungary using point counts to determine
   species richness and density. Species numbers and bird density were
   highest in extensively used vineyard:. while bird diversity was highest
   in abandoned vineyards. Abandoned vineyards were rich in species and
   individuals. mainly woodland specie:;. whereas intensively used
   vineyards had both fewer species and individuals than the other two
   vineyard types. In grassland, four management types were distinguished,
   abandoned, extensively, intensively grazed and both intensively grazed
   and fertilised grassland. Extensive grassland harboured most species,
   bird density and diversity being highest at the abandoned site which was
   covered by bushes and contained many non-grassland species. Intensively
   grazed fields had lower species numbers, lower density and diversity
   than extensively grazed grassland but were still much more species rich
   and diverse than the fertilised fields. Our results suggest that
   extensively used farmland holds the highest diversity and abundance of
   farmland birds. Conservation efforts aimed at farmland birds should
   therefore focus on maintaining extensive farming systems. (C) 2004

Abstract = {{Modern rural policies that incorporate agricultural and environmental
   aims within the broader framework of sustainable rural development are
   being formulated to address the problem of declines in grassland
   biodiversity and the destruction of sensitive landscapes and habitats in
   Europe. Extensification is the process of reducing fertiliser inputs,
   management intensity and stocking rates, and is central to these
   sustainable rural policies. However, research in the Less Favoured Areas
   of Europe has been fragmented and highly variable reflecting the
   different uses and requirements of our upland areas. Information is
   needed to determine the nature and timescale of changes in such systems,
   and whether extensive management is sustainable in the long-term. This
   paper presents results from a range of grassland extensification
   experiments across Europe, mainly within the European Union, over the
   past 30 years that quantify the impacts on soil, plant and animal
   components of the system. All have the common theme of changing the
   focus of land management from solely the agricultural product to include
   a broader range of ecological and environmental objectives. Beneficial
   changes in biodiversity resulted from more extensive management
   treatments, but at the cost of reductions in total animal output, and in
   some cases a reduction in individual animal performance. However, it is
   clear that it is a long-term process to achieve many of these changes in
   biodiversity, and this must be recognised by policy makers. We recommend
   that future extensification studies adopt an approach that will allow
   their results to be applied throughout Europe.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing is often thought to enhance native plant species
   co-existence in remnant grasslands but may also favour exotic invaders.
   Recommendations for appropriate grazing strategies are needed, for which
   an understanding of the response of plant species is necessary We
   explored the response of plant species and plant functional groups to
   grazing in temperate grassland of the Monaro Tablelands of south-east
   Australia by comparing species abundance in adjacent areas that differed
   in livestock grazing regime (minimal, infrequent and frequent). We also
   examined whether species with similar responses to grazing share certain
   traits and consider whether these traits might provide a useful method
   of assessing grazing impact. At the scale measured (0.25 m(2)), an
   infrequent grazing regime maximised plant species co-existence in these
   grasslands due to widespread invasion by exotic plant species at
   infrequent grazing intensity. Many native species declined in abundance
   when grazing frequency increased from minimal to infrequent. Annuals
   invaded under infrequent grazing while perennials declined most strongly
   under high frequency grazing. Low levels of grazing apparently reduce
   cover and create sites suitable for seed recruitment whereas more
   frequent grazing reduces the persistence of perennials. While there was
   a tendency for native species to be more susceptible to grazing impact
   than exotics, plant traits, in particular longevity (perennial, annual)
   provided a better prediction of the response of plants to grazing.
   Although a few native plant species persisted at high grazing frequency,
   even infrequent livestock grazing may not be appropriate for the
   conservation of many native perennial grassland species. Targeted
   reductions in grazing frequency may be necessary to enable the long-term
   coexistence of grazing susceptible species.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1634-1655}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Crop production in much of the western United States has caused
   extensive fragmentation of shrubsteppe and other grasslands and has
   increased regional levels of disturbance through repeated tillage of
   crop fields and applications of agrochemicals. Although there have been
   numerous studies of the effects of fragmentation on arthropods in
   forests, old fields, and cropland, there have been very few studies of
   fragmentation effects on grassland arthropods. I conducted a two-year
   study in the Columbia Basin region of the U.S. Pacific Northwest to
   determine the effects of fragmentation and regional disturbance on
   shrubsteppe communities. I sampled plants and arthropods in 20
   shrubsteppe fragments associated with annual crops, 20 fragments
   associated with perennial crops, and 20 large sections of shrubsteppe
   distant from crop fields. Fragments were corners of crop irrigation
   circles, and only sites that were undisturbed, with an apparent high
   coverage of shrubs, were included in the study.
   Results indicated no significant differences in coverages of shrubs,
   perennial grasses, total perennial forbs, total annual/biennial forbs,
   and species richness of grasses and shrubs between fragments and large
   sections of shrubsteppe. Mean percent coverage of the annual grass
   Bromus tectorum was 18.6\% greater in small fragments than in large
   sections of shrubsteppe distant from crop fields, and mean coverage of
   bare ground was 22.9\% higher and coverage of biological soil crusts was
   41.5\% lower in the fragments than in large shrubsteppe sections.
   Shrubsteppe fragments had significantly lower abundances of obligate
   herbivores, omnivores, total herbivores, obligate predators, total
   predators, plant detritivores, total detritivores, and butterflies, as
   well as fewer individuals of numerous other taxa within these trophic
   groups. Fragmentation had very little effect on species richness within
   trophic groups, probably because fragments were not that isolated from
   each other and large sections of shrubsteppe. Shrubsteppe communities
   that were next to highly disturbed annual crops had greater coverages of
   total annual/biennial forbs, and lower coverages of total perennial
   forbs and biological soil crusts when compared to shrubsteppe near
   perennial crops. Abundances of obligate herbivores, omnivores, total
   predators, plant detritivores, vertebrate-detritus feeders, and bees
   were similar in shrubsteppe near annual crops and near perennial crops.
   However, within these trophic groups, shrubsteppe near annual crops
   supported fewer obligate shrub-feeding grasshoppers, herbivorous ground
   beetles, harvestmen, antlions, darkling beetles, and butterflies than
   did shrubsteppe near perennial crops. The results suggest that a
   reduction in resources within fragments and regional disturbances caused
   by the production of annual crops were responsible for changes in
   arthropod trophic structure in fragments. Changes in trophic structure
   were probably not due to reductions in habitat heterogeneity or habitat
   isolation because plant community structure was similar in fragmented
   and unfragmented shrubsteppe, and fragments were not isolated from large
   sections of shrubsteppe.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of restorative grazing on species composition and community
   structure of butterflies and moths were studied in mesic semi-natural
   grasslands differing in their management history: (1) old continuously
   grazed pastures, (2) restored pastures with similar to5 yr of
   reinitiated grazing, and (3) abandoned former pastures. Butterflies and
   moths were counted with a transect method during 1999 and 2000 in 33
   study sites in southwest Finland. In a multivariate ordination (NMDS),
   the studied grasslands were separated from each other on the basis of
   their species composition so that the actively grazed pastures differed
   from abandoned pastures. The first ordination, axis represented most
   (73\%) of the variation in species composition, and it was strongly
   correlated with variables describing the current grazing intensity.
   Species richness and total abundance were highest in abandoned pastures,
   both for all species and for grassland-preferring species. In contrast,
   relative diversity (N-1, N-2, and alpha) and evenness (Alatalo's
   evenness index) were in most cases highest in old pastures and lowest in
   abandoned pastures. Generalized linear models (GLM) were constructed for
   four response variables: total species richness, grassland species
   richness, abundance of all species, and abundance of grassland species.
   The derived models explained 78-84\% of the total variation for species
   richness and 92-93\% for abundance, and the type of grazing history
   explained the largest proportion of variation. Mean vegetation height
   was included in the abundance models as a quadratic function, which
   indicated that butterflies and moths were most abundant at an
   intermediate level of grazing intensity, as predicted by the ``dynamic
   equilibrium model.{''} The results suggest that grazing management is a
   useful tool in the restoration of insect communities of abandoned
   semi-natural grasslands. In order to enhance the survival of species
   suffering from continuously high grazing intensity, the existing
   management instructions should be developed toward construction of
   regional networks of semi-natural grasslands, which would allow
   differing grazing intensities or rotational grazing on the patch level,
   but simultaneously ensure continuity of varying management regimes on a
   regional level.}},

Abstract = {{We tested alternative hypotheses concerning factors affecting early
   forest succession and community composition in deforested and abandoned
   areas invaded by an exotic grass, Saccharum spontaneum, in Panama. We
   hypothesized three barriers to natural regeneration: (1) Saccharum
   competition, (2) seed dispersal limitations, and (3) fire. We measured
   natural free and shrub regeneration in a factorial experiment combining
   distances from adjacent forest. mowing treatments of the Saccharum, and
   a prescribed burn. To determine the applicability of the general model
   of neotropical succession and the nucleation model Of succession to
   species composition of forest regeneration in these anthropogenic
   grasslands in Panama the effect of time since fire and distance to
   remnant vegetation (isolated trees, shrubs, and large monocots) was
   measured.
   Fire significantly affected species composition and decreased species
   richness because most species had either their resprouting ability or
   seed germination inhibited by fire: the few species that had
   regeneration enhanced by fire dominated early successional communities.
   Sites differed in time since fire, ranging from 1 to 4 yr; the
   interaction of site and distance from the forest significantly affected
   community composition and the prevalence of species with different
   dispersal mechanisms and shade tolerance. At recently burned sites.
   light-dependent wind-dispersed species predominated; most were found
   near the forest edge. As time since fire increased, significantly more
   shade-tolerant, larger-animal-dispersed species were recorded, and the
   proximity to and species identity of remnant vegetation became more
   important in affecting species composition of the natural regeneration;
   no significant effect of distance from the forest was found at sites
   that were unburned for three or more years. Our results support both
   successional models; the temporal sequence of species composition
   corresponded to later stages of the general model, while the spatial
   distribution of species followed the nucleation model. Our results
   highlight the importance of effective seed dispersal in structuring
   successional species composition and distribution and in regaining, lost
   diversity resulting from frequent fires ill the Saccharum.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the independent and combined effects of experimental
   warming and grazing on plant species diversity on the north-eastern
   Tibetan Plateau, a region highly vulnerable to ongoing climate and land
   use changes. Experimental warming caused a 26-36\% decrease in species

   grazing. Higher species losses occurred at the drier sites where N was
   less available. Moreover, we observed an indirect effect of climate
   change on species richness as mediated by plant-plant interactions. Heat
   stress and warming-induced litter accumulation are potential
   explanations for the species' responses to experimental warming. This is
   the first reported experimental evidence that climate warming could
   cause dramatic declines in plant species diversity in high elevation
   ecosystems over short time frames and supports model predictions of

Title = {{Conservation of European hares Lepus europaeus in Britain: is increasing
   habitat heterogeneity in farmland the answer?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1092-1102}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Agricultural intensification has had dramatic effects on farmland
   biodiversity and has caused declines in many taxa. Habitat changes are
   thought to be the main cause of the decline in numbers of European
   hares, Lepus europaeus, throughout Europe. In Britain there is greater
   potential to increase hare numbers in pastural landscapes than in arable
   landscape. Hares in pasture have lower population densities, poorer body
   condition and participate less in breeding than in arable habitats. We
   aimed to investigate habitat selection and home range size in a mainly
   pastural area in order to reveal why the habitat is suboptimal, and how
   it could be managed to benefit the species.
   2. A seasonal radio-tracking study was used to determine the importance
   of heterogeneity at the between- and within-habitat scales. Habitat
   selection by active and resting hares was quantified. Selection was
   investigated by categorizing habitats by type, and by structure in terms
   of vegetation height.
   3. Mean home range size was 34 ha. Winter and spring ranges were larger
   than summer and autumn ranges. Hares selected fallow land and pasture
   grazed by cattle in preference to arable crops throughout the year,
   except during the winter when crops were suitable as forage. Pasture
   grazed by sheep was avoided in all seasons but winter. Heterogeneity at
   the between-habitat scale was less important to hares than heterogeneity
   at the within-habitat scale in the pastural landscape studied.
   4. Hares selected habitats with taller vegetation during the spring and
   summer. Many of the habitats selected were heterogeneous in structure
   mainly due to cattle grazing, and hares avoided short homogeneous
   vegetation in all seasons. Hares are more likely to be limited by
   habitat in terms of cover than food in these landscapes.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Increasing habitat heterogeneity at the
   farm scale may benefit hares, especially in highly homogeneous,
   intensively managed landscapes. However, managers of pastural farmland
   should aim to increase habitat heterogeneity at the within-habitat (or
   within-field) scale in particular, to provide better cover throughout
   the year. Agri-environment schemes should target the regeneration of
   heterogeneity in pastural landscapes, by encouraging changes such as an
   increase in fallow land and a reduction in livestock density. Such
   shifts in management are likely to benefit both hares and farmland
   biodiversity in general.}},

Abstract = {{The transfer of hay from a donor site onto a receptor site is currently
   a widely accepted restoration procedure to establish grasslands with
   high biodiversity and rich in species. The impact of this procedure on
   vegetation has been well studied. However, its influence on the insect
   population has not been investigated. This study verifies that
   individuals of Metrioptera bicolor (Orthopteroidea: Tettigoniidae) were
   successfully transferred with hay. Three individuals transferred with
   the hay were still able to reproduce after the hay transfer. This result
   corresponds to 4.6\% of the 65 marked individuals that were mapped on
   the donor site on the day of hay transfer. Of the estimated 1220-3013
   individuals on the donor site (8300 m(2)), 56-139 reproductively able
   individuals were transferred with the hay. Suitable habitat structures
   presupposed, this number is sufficient to initiate a persistent
   colonisation of the species on the receptor site. The loss rate of M.
   bicolor due to grass cutting totalled 42\%, which can be considered a
   very high mortality rate. Comparable studies on bush crickets show a
   medium loss rate of 21\%, in relation to body size.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: How long may it take for desert perennial vegetation to
   recover from prolonged human disturbance and how do different plant
   community variables (i.e. diversity, density and cover) change during
   the recovery process?
   Location: Sonoran Desert, Arizona, USA.
   Methods: Since protection from grazing from 1907 onwards, plant
   diversity, density and cover of perennial species were monitored
   intermittently on ten 10 m x 10 m permanent plots on Tumamoc Hill,
   Tucson, Arizona, USA.
   Results: The study shows an exceptionally slow recovery of perennial
   vegetation from prolonged heavy grazing and other human impacts. Since
   protection, overall species richness and habitat heterogeneity at the
   study site continued to increase until the 1960s when diversity, density
   and cover had been stabilized. During the same period, overall plant
   density and cover also increased. Species turnover increased gradually
   with time but no significant relation between any of the three community
   variables and precipitation or Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) was
   detected.
   Conclusions: It took more than 50 yr for the perennial vegetation to
   recover from prolonged human disturbance. The increases in plant species
   richness, density, and cover of the perennial vegetation were mostly due
   to the increase of herbaceous species, especially palatable species. The
   lack of a clear relationship between environment (e.g. precipitation)
   and community variables suggests that site history and plant life
   history must be taken into account in examining the nature of vegetation
   recovery processes after disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Recent losses and fragmentation of tallgrass; prairie habitat to
   agriculture and urban development have led to corresponding declines in
   diversity and abundance of plants and birds associated with such
   habitat. Mowing and burning are alternative management strategies for
   restoring and rejuvenating prairies in fragmented landscapes, but their
   specific, comparative effects are the subjects of ongoing evaluation. We
   compared the responses of plant and bird communities on four sets of
   mowed, burned, and untreated sites of small (3-10 ha), fragmented
   tallgrass prairies at the DeSoto National Wildlife Refuge (DNWR), Iowa,
   U.S.A., during May-July in 1998 and 1999. Species richness and diversity
   of plants, resident grassland birds, and communities of birds associated
   with grassland edges (edge species) were independent of treatment.
   Although not affecting species richness and diversity in plant
   communities, mowed sites ranked lower in total plant coverage and total
   forb coverage than burned sites or untreated sites. In contrast,
   untreated sites had more coverage by shrubs, suggesting that mowing and
   burning did retard shrub encroachment. Overall, abundance and diversity
   of plants and birds were generally insensitive to management strategies.
   Small, fragmented sites of rare habitat may not respond in the short
   term to management treatments and may not be capable of supporting
   highly diverse communities, no matter how intensively manipulated. It is
   more probable that diversity of native prairie communities can be
   enhanced and restored only through long-term efforts, acquisition of
   large land units capable of supporting stable populations, and
   deliberate reintroduction of species of high conservation value.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Are the recruitment patterns of deliberately introduced
   wildflower species influenced by cutting frequencies and disturbance
   treatments? To what extent do these different treatments affect
   productivity and sward structure of an agriculturally improved
   grassland?
   Location: A mesic lowland grassland near Gottingen, Lower Saxony.
   Germany.
   Methods: Recruitment success of eight sown wildflower species was
   studied in a permanent grassland treated by a factorial combination of
   different pre-sowing cutting intervals (1.3 or 9 wk). post-sowing
   cutting intervals (1, 3 or 9 wk) and disturbance (control. harrowing,
   removal of sward). Seedling emergence and survival. biomass production
   and sward structure were followed over two years.
   Results: For most species seedling emergence was highest in the
   harrowing treatment. The complete sward removal did not further increase
   seedling emergence. Seedling survival was strongly influenced by the
   post-sowing cutting frequency with highest mortality in the 9 wk cutting
   interval compared to one and 3 wk cutting intervals. Annual dry matter
   yield varied between 4.4, 5.9 and 9.4 t.ha(-1) in the 1, 3 and 9 wk
   pre-sowing cutting treatment, respectively. In June, when the seeds were
   sown. the tiller number of the I wk cut plots was twice as high as for
   the 9 wk cut plots and five times higher than in the harrowing
   treatment.
   Conclusions: Disturbance by harrowing provided the optimal environmental
   cues to trigger germination, whereas seedling survival was facilitated
   by increased light penetration due to frequent cutting. The
   investigation revealed the overriding importance of frequent standing
   crop removal in the early phase of seedling establishment on
   agriculturally improved grassland.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Which are the success and failure of restoration measures,
   particularly sod-cutting and hydrological measures, in small wetlands on
   mineral soils in The Netherlands.
   Location: Twente. in the eastern part of The Netherlands.
   Methods: Success or failure of restoration measures has been assessed by
   comparing experimental plots with that in reference plots for (1)
   species richness, (2) re-establishment of endangered species and (3)
   species composition, including life forms and Red List species. In total
   119 samples were taken in 42 permanent plots in fen meadows, small-sedge
   marshes, wet heathlands. and soft-water pools. Topsoil samples were
   analysed for pH. Ca. Mg. Na, K and Cation Exchange Capacity. Gradient
   analysis was carried out by means of Canonical Correspondence Analysis.
   Results: Sod-cutting. in combination with re-wetting measures (infilling
   of ditches and drains), led to restoration of communities of soft-water
   pools and small sedge marshes within five years. This rapid recovery is
   probably related to the presence of persistent seed banks of the
   component species of these communities. Complete restoration of fen
   meadows took longer (10-15 yr). Apparently, many species of fen meadows
   have short-lived seed banks. Sod-cutting of a degraded wet heathland and
   a soft-water pool was only successful temporarily. probably as a
   consequence of low water tables.
   Conclusions: To prevent depletion of (persistent) soil seed banks.
   sod-cutting in nutrient-poor wetlands is not recommended in areas where
   the groundwater regime and the base status of the soil can not be
   restored to levels required by plant communities of wet heathlands.}},

Abstract = {{Plant species composition of most managed pasture lands tends to be
   dominated by one or two species, usually a perennial grass and a legume.
   Recent ecological research suggests that increasing this forage
   diversity could increase pasture productivity and stability. We
   conducted a 4-yr field experiment to determine whether increasing the
   diversity of pasture mixtures would increase yields and improve
   interannual yield stability. Mixtures of cool-season pasture plants
   ranging from one to 15 species were planted into 2.25-m(2) plots in May
   1998. Interannual yield variation and yield responses to mowing
   frequency (2- vs. 4-wk frequency) were used to evaluate stability.
   Forage yields averaged <400 g m(-2) yr(-1) in mixtures having one or two
   species, while mixtures with three or more species averaged <1000 g
   m(-2) yr(-1). Increasing the diversity of mixtures beyond three sown
   species did not consistently improve yields. Interannual yield variation
   was lowest in the one- and two-species mixtures, and showed no
   consistent relationship with increasing species diversity. The number of
   species planted in each mixture declined by approximately 30\% from 1999
   to 2001, with the mixtures becoming dominated by perennial grasses.
   Although limitations in our experimental design prevent us from making
   strong conclusions about relationships between forage diversity and
   pasture productivity, our findings suggest that increased forage yield
   and stability may be best achieved by planting two or three forage
   species that are well matched to specific environmental conditions
   rather than planting a random assemblage of forage species in a complex
   mixture.}},

   Out of 238 cover and density comparisons between inside and outside

   Generally, where differences occurred, basal and canopy cover were

   taller inside exclosures at 3 sites grazed by sheep (Ovis aries).
   perennial grasses showed no vertical height difference. Aboveground

   Species richness was similar at all sires and never varied > 4 species

   significantly affected by grazing intensity, aspect, or slope. Although
   plant species composition was similar (Sorensen's similarity index =
   0.87) between both grazing intensities, species frequency and cover were
   affected by grazing intensity. Festuca rubra L. and Agrostis capillaris
   L. were the most common species under both grazing pressures. Moderate
   grazing intensity (50\% herbage removal) plots contained a greater
   number of plant species with a frequency of more than 50\%. The lowest
   cover for E rubra corresponded to low grazing intensity, north aspects,
   and steeper slopes. The lowest cover for A. capillaris was found under
   low grazing intensity (30\% herbage removal) and steeper slopes.
   Danthonia decumbens (L.) P. C., Potentilla erecta (L.) Rauschal, and
   Trifolium repens L. were significantly affected by aspect and grazing

Abstract = {{There has been a growing recent interest in how foliar herbivory may
   indirectly affect the belowground sub-system, but little is known about
   the belowground consequences of the identity, species composition or
   diversity of foliar herbivores. We performed an experiment, utilising
   model grassland communities containing three plant species, in which
   treatments consisted of addition of each of eight aphid species in
   single and in two- four- and eight-species combinations, as well as an
   aphid-free treatment. While aphid species treatments did not affect
   total plant biomass or productivity, aphid species identity had
   important effects on the relative abundance of the three plant species.
   This in turn affected the abundances of each of three groups of
   secondary consumers in the soil food web (bacterial- and fungal-feeding
   nematodes, and enchytraeids) but not primary consumers (microbes,
   herbivorous nematodes) or tertiary consumers (predatory nematodes). The
   fact that some trophic levels responded to treatments while others did
   not is consistent with trophic dynamic theory. Aphid species treatments
   also affected the community composition within each of the herbivorous,
   microbe-feeding and top predatory nematode groups, as well as diversity
   within the first two of these groups. However, aphid species diversity
   per se had few effects. There were specific instances in which specific
   aboveground and belowground response variables in two aphid species
   combinations differed significantly from those in both of the
   corresponding single aphid species treatments (apparently as a
   consequence of resource use complementarity between coexisting aphid
   species), but no instance in which increasing aphid diversity beyond two
   species had any effect. Our results provide evidence that the identity
   of aboveground consumers can have effects that propagate through
   multiple trophic levels in soil food webs in terms of consumer
   abundance, and composition and diversity within trophic levels.}},

Abstract = {{Predicting the consequences of species loss is critically important,
   given present threats to biological diversity such as habitat
   destruction, overharvesting and climate change(1). Several empirical
   studies have reported decreased ecosystem performance ( for example,
   primary productivity) coincident with decreased biodiversity(2-4),
   although the relative influence of biotic effects and confounding
   abiotic factors has been vigorously debated(5-7). Whereas several
   investigations focused on single trophic levels ( for example, grassland
   plants)(8,9), studies of whole systems have revealed multiple layers of
   feedbacks, hidden drivers and emergent properties(10,11), making the
   consequences of species loss more difficult to predict(12). Here we
   report functionally important organisms and considerable biocomplexity
   in a sedimentary seafloor habitat, one of Earth's most widespread
   ecosystems. Experimental field measurements demonstrate how the
   abundance of spatangoid urchins - infaunal ( in seafloor sediment)
   grazers / deposit feeders - is positively related to primary production,
   as their activities change nutrient fluxes and improve conditions for
   production by microphytobenthos (sedimentatry microbes and unicellular
   algae). Declines of spatangoid urchins after trawling are well
   documented(13,14), and our research linking these bioturbators to
   important benthic - pelagic fluxes highlights potential ramifications
   for productivity in coastal oceans.}},

   Overall, treatment effects on community structure and individual species

   significantly more bare ground wallows around sites burned at a 4-y,

   gall-forming insects in natural forest patches in a Brazilian. oodplain
   ( Pantanal of Mato Grosso do Sul). These patches are regionally known as
   `capoes', basically composed of woody vegetation. Twenty-seven patches
   were surveyed. In each patch two transects were conducted for gall
   sampling. One transect encircled the patches while the other was
   conducted in the interior of the patch, totaling 54 h of sampling. Host
   plant and galling insect species composition differed quite
   characteristically between the edge and the interior of patches, but
   galling insect richness did not. When insect gall richness was expressed
   as the ratio between insect gall and host plant richness ( gall per
   plant ratio), a weak species - area relationship was found. Our results
   suggest that the number of galling insects per individual plant is not
   affected by the size of the patch. Despite these results, the natural
   forest patches found in this region seem well suited for long-term
   studies addressing species - area relationships. With regard to
   herbivorous insects, these studies should be combined with research on

Abstract = {{Molinia encroachment is considered a major threat to moorland and
   heathland conservation in Europe, and there is a need to develop
   management strategies to control Molinia and restore Calluna moorland.
   Here we combined weed control and restoration treatments into an
   integrated land management strategy (ILMS) to provide a more sympathetic
   approach than previous prescriptions. We applied the following
   treatments in factorial combination to a Molinia-dominated moorland in
   the Yorkshire Dales: grazing (ESA prescription level versus no grazing),
   cutting (0, 1, 2 and 3 cuts), +/-application of a graminicide and
   +/-Calluna brash addition. The response of the vegetation was assessed
   for four years. These data were analyzed using a combination of
   univariate and multivariate analysis of variance based on constrained
   ordinations but combined with bivariate standard deviational ellipses.
   This combined approach was extremely useful in identifying trends in
   this complex dataset.
   The only treatment that had consistent effects in the univariate
   analysis of variance was cutting, where there was increased bare ground,
   reduced vegetation height, increased species diversity and reduced
   Molinia cover. Cutting three times had the greatest effect, maintaining
   a reduced Molinia cover over four years. The multivariate analysis
   showed that there were important community level interactions. Grazing
   generally produced vegetation which had a greater moorland species
   complement. Where grazing was restricted the vegetation had a greater
   component of Molinia and other acid grassland species. The most
   effective treatment was the grazed plots, cut thrice, which maintained a
   low Molinia cover for longest and had less variation in moorland species
   in the fourth year. Graminicide and brash application had marginal
   effects on species composition, but the best plots were those given
   herbicide alone, or in combination with brash addition.
   These results contrast with other studies, where non-selective herbicide
   treatment and Calluna addition were required to obtain Molinia control
   and Calluna regeneration. However, great variation has been found
   between sites, and managers should be prepared to tailor ILMS for their
   own site. This is likely to require a knowledge of the initial floristic
   composition, seed banks and experimentation. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A challenge of experimental restoration is to determine the reasons why
   restored communities develop as they do. Divergent successions in
   plantings of 16 tallgrass prairie species sown in equal densities in
   Wisconsin (USA) revealed strong effects of vole (Microtus
   pennsylvanicus) herbivory on vegetation initially protected for an
   establishment period of over 24 months, by which time all principal
   species were flowering and fruiting. Half of the plots were then
   subjected to 48 months of vole access. An otherwise common legume
   (Desmodium canadense) and grass (Elyinus virginicus) were all but
   eliminated in 48 months of exposure: combined cover under protection was
   43 +/- 6\%, but plummeted to <1\% cover when voles had access. Dicots
   not eaten by voles (Pycnanthemum virginianum, Rudbeckia subtomentosa)
   averaged 40 +/- 7\% cover where voles were excluded, but 68 +/- 8\%
   after 48 months of vole access. Repeated-measures analyses of variance
   revealed that net decreases (D. canadense, E. virginicus) or increases
   (P. virginianum, R. subtomentosa) in cover masked nonlinear effects
   reflecting vole-driven transient dynamics during divergent successional
   processes. Diversities diverged for three years after vole access; a
   dramatic convergence of diversities in the fourth year leaves grossly
   similar communities with similar numbers of species and similar levels
   of equity, but distinctly different species compositions. Vole-mediated
   effects on vegetation resemble those likely to occur in native prairies,
   without the catastrophic changes in cover and standing crop caused by
   rodents that occurred in some previous efforts of this research program.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat loss and fragmentation currently threaten ecosystems worldwide,
   yet remain difficult to quantify because within-fragment habitat and
   landscape-scale influences often interact in unique ways. Although
   individual species respond to fragmentation differently, large-scale
   conservation planning must unavoidably target multiple species. Although
   information on a population's response to fragmentation is critical, and
   measurements of species richness provide useful insights, exclusive
   reliance on these responses may mask important information about the
   taxonomic composition of assemblages in response to fragmentation. The
   North American tallgrass prairie ecosystem is one of the most threatened
   and fragmented ecosystems in the world, and insects are significant
   contributors to its biodiversity. In remaining grassland fragments, we
   evaluated within-fragment influences in conjunction with landscape-scale
   responses of representative insect communities from four feeding guilds:
   generalists, specialists, multiple life stage habitat use, and
   predators. Fragment-specific attributes capable of. influencing insect
   diversity include plant species composition, plant biomass, abundance of
   blooming flowers, and vertical habitat heterogeneity created by the
   vegetation. Landscape-scale factors expected to influence patterns of
   insect species diversity include fragment size and shape as well as the
   spatial configuration of fragments. Ordination techniques were used to
   summarize composition of each feeding guild assemblage of each fragment,
   and structural equation modeling was used to examine the direct and
   indirect effects of fragmentation with influences from local habitats.
   Generalists (Orthoptera), mixed-modality feeding that changes with life
   stage (Lepidoptera), and specialist herbivores (Curculionidae) all
   responded directly to within-site characterizations of the plant
   community. Site management from large ungulate grazing or mowing for hay
   production consistently had an indirect effect on the insect community
   through influences on plant community composition. The predator
   assemblage (Coccinellidae) was influenced directly by fragment shape. To
   maintain insect biodiversity in tallgrass prairie fragments, these
   results indicate that conservation practices should focus on communities
   in order to maintain insect biodiversity in tallgrass prairie fragments.
   Landscape-scale factors must also be considered when making conservation
   decisions, primarily because predators (top trophic level organisms) are
   more likely to respond to regional changes.}},

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{631-640}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. In a microcosm experiment we examined the effects of individual
   species of microarthropods, and variations in microarthropod diversity
   of up to eight species, on soil microbial properties and the short-term
   partitioning of a dual-labelled organic nitrogen source
   (glycine-2-C-13-N-15) between a grassland plant, Agrostis capillaris,
   and the soil microbial biomass, to determine how soil fauna and their
   diversity influence plant-microbial competition for organic N.
   2. We hypothesized that variations in the diversity of animals would
   influence the partitioning of N-15 inputs between plants and the
   microbial biomass, due to the effect of animal grazing on the microbial
   biomass, and hence its ability to sequester N.
   3. Certain individual species of Collembola influenced the microbial
   community of the soil. Folsomia quadrioculata reduced microbial biomass,
   whereas Mesaphorura macrochaeta enhanced arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM)
   colonization of A. capillaris roots. Effects of increasing species
   richness of microarthropods on microbial biomass and AM colonization
   were detected, but these effects could be interpreted in relation to the
   presence or absence of individual species.
   4. Microbial uptake of added N-15 was not affected by the presence of
   any of the individual species of animal in the monoculture treatments.
   Similarly, increasing diversity of microarthropods had no detectable
   effect on microbial N-15.
   5. Root and shoot uptake of N-15 was also largely unaffected by both
   single species and variations in diversity of microarthropods. However,
   one collembolan species, Ceratophysella denticulata, reduced root N-15
   capture when present in monoculture. We did not detect C-13 in plant
   tissue under any experimental treatments, indicating that all N was
   taken up by plants after mineralization.
   6. Our data suggest that, while single species and variations in
   diversity of microarthropods influence microbial abundance in soil,
   there is no effect on microbial or plant uptake of N. Overall, these
   data provide little support for the notion that microbial-feeding soil
   animals are regulators of microbial-plant competition for N.}},

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{119}},

Abstract = {{Intensive agriculture has resulted in the loss of biodiversity and the
   specialist flora and fauna associated with the semi-natural grasslands
   of low-intensity pastoral systems throughout northwest Europe.
   Techniques employed to restore and re-create these grasslands on
   agricultural land in the UK are reviewed. Extensive cutting and grazing
   management have been shown to diversify improved swards and facilitate
   re-colonisation on ex-arable soils, although rates of re-assembly of
   plant communities with affinity to existing semi-natural grasslands have
   generally been slow. On former agriculturally improved swards, nutrient
   depletion has accelerated this process, especially where ``gaps{''} for
   establishment have been created. Similarly, on ex-arable soils
   ``nutrient stripping{''} and sowing with diverse seed mixtures has led
   to the rapid development of species-rich swards. On free draining brown
   earths such an approach may be required to restore grassland communities
   where soil phosphorous concentrations exceed semi-natural levels by more
   than 10 mg/l (using Olsen's bicarbonate extractant). However, the
   appropriateness of this threshold for other soil types requires further
   sampling. Although restored grasslands are likely to contribute to
   national biodiversity targets success will ultimately depend on the
   reinstatement of the communities and ecological functions of
   semi-natural references. Although this is technically feasible for a few
   plant assemblages, less is known about the re-assembly of microbial and
   faunal communities, or the importance of trophic interactions during
   grassland succession. As a consequence, more research is required on the
   functional attributes of semi-natural grasslands, as well as the methods
   required to restore localised types, novel nutrient depletion
   techniques, the ``phased{''} introduction of desirable but
   poor-performing species and the performance of different genotypes
   during grassland restoration. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{From a review of the literature, we conclude that the main mechanism by
   which grazing livestock affect biodiversity in pastures is the creation
   and maintenance of sward structural heterogeneity, particularly as a
   result of dietary choice. We identify lack of understanding of the
   currencies used by animals in their foraging decisions and the spatial
   scale of these decisions as major constraints to better management. We
   conclude that there are important differences between domestic grazing
   animal species in their impact on grazed communities and that these can
   be related to differences in dental and digestive anatomy, but also, and
   probably more importantly, to differences in body size. Differences
   between breeds within species appear to be relatively minor and again
   largely related to body size. We conclude that there is an urgent need
   to understand the genetic basis of these differences and also to
   separate true breed effects from effects of rearing environment. We also
   review the economic implications of using different animal types and
   conclude that there is a need for more research integrating these
   aspects with biodiversity outcomes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This study was performed to analyse how a vegetative propagation pattern
   of plants affects the coexistence of species and subsequent species
   richness of the community. We compared community average clonal growth
   in the herbal communities of forests, wooded meadows, and open meadows
   in Laelatu, Estonia. The parameters used for the calculation of the
   community averages and measured for each species were ramet life span,
   rhizome branching, and clonal mobility. We also examined the intrinsic
   (i.e. independent of the environment) relationship between community
   clonal growth and plant species density. We found strong correlations
   between the environmental factors (productivity, light availability, and
   mowing regime) and community averages of clonal growth parameters, while
   species density was (negatively) correlated only with community average
   of rhizome increment. The community average of ramet life span decreased
   with the increasing biomass of the herb layer. No evidence was found to
   support the hypothesis that species-rich communities may consist of
   species with more contrasting mobility compared with species-poor
   communities. Independent of the effect of the environmental factors,
   species density was positively correlated with ramet density. There was
   intrinsic positive relationship between species density and community
   average of ramet life span at open meadow sites and intrinsic negative
   relationship between species density and community average of rhizome
   increment at wooded meadow sites. We conclude that in forest communities
   the capability of clonal plants to forage for light is favoured, while
   in unmown meadows a competitively strong phalanx growth form is
   advantageous. We established that ramet turnover increases and
   vegetative mobility decreases with increasing species diversity,
   although these two relationships depend strongly on the type of the
   studied community.}},

Abstract = {{The calcareous grasslands of the south-western French Alps have been
   poorly studied, although they provide suitable habitat for rare plant
   species and communities. The separate and combined effects on calcareous
   grassland communities of habitat conditions (lithology, soil moisture)
   and management regimes (grazing intensity, cutting regime) were studied
   using constrained ordination techniques (canonical correspondence
   analysis with variance partitioning). Among the explanatory variables
   considered, the most important factor determining floristic composition
   was lithology, which explained 11.9\% of floristic variability, followed
   by grazing intensity (6.0\%). Additive effects of management and
   lithology explained 23.9\% of floristic variability. Species niche
   amplitude was measured by conditional variances of samples along main
   ordination axes, in order to define adequate conservation management for
   the rarest short-lived species with narrow niche breadth on both habitat
   and management gradients. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present native and exotic woody vegetation of the rainshadow region
   of Central Otago, in eastern South Island, New Zealand, is described.
   Fourteen present-day associations of woody species are related to a
   gradient in elevation and climate, and to the degree of disturbance by
   fire and mammalian grazing since human settlement. A few closed-canopy
   forest remnants remain only in the montane zone, while more modified
   forest relicts are scattered across a wider range of environments.
   Remaining woody plant associations have originated as secondary
   successions following fire, and range from exotic-species-invaded
   lowland associations on semi-arid basin floors to prostrate,
   native-species-dominated associations on mountain tops. Indigenous
   short-tussock grasslands and seral shrublands are being invaded by
   exotic trees and shrubs, especially in lowland environments. Dwarf and
   prostrate low shrub associations on the range tops may have replaced
   tussock grasslands since the commencement of pastoralism, where taller
   tussock-shrubland communities were destroyed by fires soon after human
   settlement. The region's vegetation is not at equilibrium, and taller,
   woody communities tend to develop following removal of fire and grazing.
   Biodiversity restoration goals for deforested eastern South Island
   regions such as Central Otago should include long-term succession to
   indigenous woody communities in representative areas of all land
   environments.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Plant species richness in rural landscapes of northern Europe has been
   positively influenced by traditional management for millennia. Owing to
   abandonment of these practices, the number of species-rich semi-natural
   grasslands has decreased, and remaining habitats suffer from
   deterioration, fragmentation, and plant species decline. To prevent
   further extinctions, restoration efforts have increased during the last
   decades, by reintroducing grazing in former semi-natural grasslands. To
   assess the ecological factors that might influence the outcome of such
   restorations, we made a survey of semi-natural grasslands in Sweden that
   have been restored during the last decade. We investigated how plant
   species richness, species density, species composition, and abundance of
   10 species that are indicators of grazing are affected by (1) the size
   of the restored site, (2) the time between abandonment of grazing and
   restoration, (3) the time elapsed since restoration, and (4) the
   abundance of trees and shrubs at the restored site. Only two factors,
   abundance of trees and shrubs and time since restoration, were
   positively associated with total species richness and species density
   per meter square at restored sites. Variation in species composition
   among restored sites was not related to any of the investigated factors.
   Species composition was relatively similar among sites, except in
   mesic/wet grasslands. The investigated factors had small effects on the
   abundance of the grazing-indicator species. Only Campanula rotundifolia
   responded to restoration with increasing abundance and may thus be a
   suitable indicator of improved habitat quality. In conclusion, positive
   effects on species richness may appear relatively soon after
   restoration, but rare, short-lived species are still absent. Therefore,
   remnant populations in surrounding areas may be important in fully
   recreating former species richness and composition.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity conservation in agricultural landscapes is considered a
   challenge for nature conservation. The complementation/supplementation
   hypothesis may be an appropriate theoretical background for butterfly
   conservation in agricultural landscapes, by considering not only one
   patch but also several patches fulfilling various or similar ecological
   requirements. The aim of this article was to determine if butterflies'
   use of the landscape may be explained by this hypothesis. Two
   predictions of the complementation/supplementation hypothesis were
   tested: (i) butterfly ``use{''} of herbaceous patches depends on the
   nature of the herbaceous patches and their management; (ii) butterflies
   stay preferentially in certain patch types. Mark-recapture experiments
   and behaviour recording were carried out in western France farmlands on
   Maniola jurtina. Herbaceous patches were grouped into six types: road
   verge, lane, hedge bank, grazed, mown and unproductive meadows. The
   first prediction was validated as butterflies did not use the different
   patch types in the same way. The road verge and lane were mainly used
   for feeding which is consistent with their high value of nectar
   abundance. Flying was the main behaviour expressed by butterflies in the
   unproductive and grazed meadows. When considering other activities than
   flying, the unproductive meadow was principally used for feeding and the
   grazed meadow for resting behaviour. The second prediction was confirmed
   as butterflies stayed less in grazed meadows and road verges than in
   lanes. Perspectives brought by complementation/supplementation
   hypothesis to conservation plans in dynamic farmland mosaics are
   discussed. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of restoration
   management on the composition of a macro-invertebrate community in a
   formerly, nutrient-poor grassland. Four grassland plots were selected
   that were last fertilised 7, 11, 24 or 29 years before sampling in 1996.
   In the same plots it was observed that nutrient impoverishment as a
   restoration tool resulted in a decrease in primary production and a
   directional shift in vegetation composition after cessation of
   fertiliser application. Terrestrial isopods, millipedes, and centipedes
   were sampled with pitfall traps in the four plots. The directional shift
   observed in vegetation composition before this study was not accompanied
   by a directional change in macro-invertebrate composition. Both the
   field poorest in nutrients and the one richest in nutrients showed the
   lowest density and species richness, while the species composition was
   similar across intermediate succession stages. By far the most specimens
   and species were caught in the field that had not received fertilisers
   for 24 years. Succession theory could only partly explain the observed
   results. Canonical correspondence analysis of the data revealed that
   only a small part of the pattern could be explained by the nutrient
   status of the grasslands. The C accumulation due to secondary succession
   of plants was hypothesised to influence the densities and diversity of

Title = {{Application of the fire-grazing interaction to restore a shifting mosaic
   on tallgrass prairie}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{604-614}},

Abstract = {{1. Management of rangelands has long operated under the paradigm of
   minimizing spatially discrete disturbances, often under the objective of
   reducing inherent heterogeneity within managed ecosystems. Management of
   grazing animals has focused on uniform distribution of disturbance, so
   that no areas are heavily disturbed or undisturbed (i.e. management to
   the `middle').
   2. A model of the fire-grazing interaction argues that grazing and fire
   interact through a series of positive and negative feedbacks to cause a
   shifting mosaic of vegetation pattern across the landscape. This
   interaction was important in the evolution of species in the North
   American Great Plains grasslands. This approach has the potential to
   serve as an ecological-based model for management of grasslands with a
   long evolutionary history of grazing.
   3. We compared a heterogeneity-based approach, in which fire is applied
   to discrete patches, with typical homogeneity-based land management in
   the North American Great Plains, to determine if patch burning followed
   by focal grazing creates a shifting mosaic pattern of vegetation
   structure and composition.
   4. Our data suggest that spatially discrete fires promote focal grazing,
   where grazing animals devote 75\% of grazing time within the one-third
   of the area that has been burned within the past year. These focal
   disturbances cause local changes in the plant community and increase
   patch-level heterogeneity across landscapes. As the focal disturbance is
   shifted to other patches over time, successional processes lead to
   changes in local plant communities and the patchwork landscape can be
   described as a shifting mosaic.
   5. A patch-dynamic approach can be accomplished in the tallgrass prairie
   through applying spatially discrete fires and allowing animals free
   access to a diversity of landscape elements that vary in time since
   focal disturbance. This increases heterogeneity across the landscape, a
   variable that has been shown to be critical to some wildlife species as
   well as the structure and function of grassland ecosystems.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that the
   fire-grazing model may be useful for generating heterogeneity in
   grassland management. Discrete fires are applied to patches, and patchy
   grazing by herbivores promotes a shifting vegetation mosaic across the
   landscape. Furthermore, application of the model has the potential of
   increasing the area of rangelands under management for conservation
   purposes, because livestock production is maintained at a level similar
   to traditional management. So, by managing transient focal patches that
   move through the landscape, heterogeneity has the potential to be a
   central paradigm for managing landscapes for multiple objectives, such
   as biodiversity and agricultural productivity.}},

Abstract = {{Burnets were surveyed in 100 semi-natural pastures in the province of
   Ostergotland, southeastern Sweden. We analysed the presence/absence of
   burnets in relation to habitat characteristics, and species richness of
   butterflies and plants. Five species were found (Adscita statices,
   Zygaena osterodensis, Z. viciae, Z. filipendulae and Z. lonicerae), all
   occurring in 33\%-36\% of the localities. Among these, four are
   nationally red-listed. More species were found on (1) large semi-natural
   pastures, compared with small, (2) low- to medium-grazed semi-natural
   pastures, compared with heavily grazed, and (3) open semi-natural
   pastures, compared with wooded. A. statices and Z. viciae had a higher
   frequency of occupancy at localities surrounded by a large density of
   pastures, but the occurence of the other species did not rely on this
   variable. The number of burnet species per locality was positively
   correlated with the number of butterfly species, and slightly positively
   correlated with species richness of plants. The difference in species
   richness among burnets, butterflies and plants may be explained by
   different responses to grazing pressure; the species richness of burnets
   and butterflies peaked in localities with a low grazing pressure, while
   species richness of plants was unaffected by grazing. As burnets are
   easily surveyed and indicate a high butterfly-species richness, they may
   be suitable indicators of species richness of pastures. As uniform
   management with heavy grazing is detrimental for burnets and for many
   butterflies, it should be avoided at localities with a species-rich
   fauna.}},

Abstract = {{More than a century since Charles Darwin stated that diverse grasslands
   produce more herbage than monocultures, scientists still debate the
   relationship between species diversity and ecosystem function.
   Postulated benefits of diversity in experimental grasslands include
   greater and more stable primary production along with more efficient
   nutrient use. These benefits have been extrapolated to forage and
   grazing land systems with little supporting objective data. Most
   information on the potential benefits of increased plant diversity comes
   from studies of synthesized grasslands that have not included domestic
   grazing animals. We explore this debate relative to the management of
   temperate forage and grazing lands. Plant species diversity refers to
   the number of species (richness) and their relative abundance (evenness)
   within a defined area. Plant relations influence biodiversity responses
   through positive (e.g., facilitation, N-2 fixation, hydraulic lift) and
   negative interactions (e.g., competitive exclusion, allelopathy). Early
   20th century research on complex mixtures of forage species (limited to
   grasses and legumes) for pasture indicated equivocal results regarding
   benefits of species-rich mixtures and typically recommended using the
   best adapted species in simple grass-legume mixtures. Recent research
   indicates potential herbage yield benefits from species-rich mixtures
   for pastures. Limited animal productivity research on species-rich
   mixtures indicates variable responses and much more research is needed.
   Grazing land productivity is a primary focus for biodiversity benefits
   because of the direct economic relevance to producers. However, taking a
   broader view of the multifunctionality of grazing lands to include
   environmental and aesthetic benefits to humans reveals a great scope for
   using biodiversity in grazing land management.}},

Abstract = {{Pasture productivity under harsh environments can be increased by
   planting more drought-resistant species or by increasing species
   diversity. This research was conducted under two large (10.2 x 26.8 m)
   rainout shelters combined with a drip irrigation system to provide
   deficit, normal, and excessive moisture conditions. A two-species
   mixture containing the relatively drought-tolerant species, orchardgrass
   (Dactylis glomerata L.) and red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) and two
   five-species mixtures were compared with a mixture containing the
   drought-sensitive species, white clover (Trifolium repens L.) and
   Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), which are the predominant species
   in northeastern USA pastures. Plots were clipped from mid-May to early
   October in 2000 and 2001 on a schedule that mimicked
   management-intensive grazing practices. The five-species mixture
   containing chicory (Cichorium intybus L.), orchardgrass, Kentucky
   bluegrass, perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), and white clover had
   the greatest dry matter yield at all moisture levels. Yield in that
   mixture increased 89\% in the dry, 61\% in the normal, and 43\% (by
   weight) in the wet treatments compared with the white clover/ Kentucky
   bluegrass mixture. Increased yield was primarily due to the robust
   growth of chicory which dominated the mixture, accounting for 71\% of
   harvested biomass by the fall of 2001. In addition, white clover growing
   in the mixture with chicory had improved leaf water relations and
   greater relative growth rates than white clover growing in the
   two-species mixture. Including the functional attribute of a deep-rooted
   forb appeared to be more important than species richness, per se, in
   improving forage yield.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing of livestock in streams and associated riparian habitats
   (hereafter referred to as riparian zones) may affect small mammal
   communities by influencing vegetation, water quality, and other site
   characteristics. To better understand these effects, we compared
   vegetation structure, and abundance and richness of small mammals in
   grazed riparian zones and similar areas where livestock had recently
   (1-2 years) been excluded in southwest Pennsylvania, 1998 and 1999.
   Mammalian species richness and abundance (all species combined, meadow
   voles {[}Microtus pennsylvanicus Ord], and meadow jumping mice {[}Zapus
   hudsonius Zimmermann]) were greater on sites where livestock had been
   excluded than grazed areas. These findings are likely the result of
   greater litter cover and increased vertical vegetation obstruction
   observed on these sites. Because small mammal communities respond
   quickly to relaxation of grazing in riparian zones, subsidy programs
   exist to partially pay for fencing, and landowners may potentially
   benefit from fencing these areas through improved water quality, erosion
   control, and livestock health, fencing may be an effective wildlife and
   grazing management tool.}},

Abstract = {{Birds associated with prairie ecosystems are declining and the

   may be a factor. Livestock grazing intensity influences the seral stage
   of grassland communities and resource managers lack information to
   assess how grassland birds are affected by these changes. We estimated
   bird density, species diversity, and species richness on 37 sites in 4
   seral stages of western wheatgrass {[}Pascopyrum smithii (Rydb.) A.
   Love]-green needlegrass {[}Nassella viridula (Trin.) Barkworth]
   communities of the Fort Pierre National Grassland. Bird species richness
   did not differ among seral stages (P = 0.57), but bird species diversity
   was greater (P < 0.10) in early seral stages compared to
   late-intermediate seral stages. Grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus
   savannarum Gmlin), bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus Linnaeus), dickcissel
   (Spiza americana Gmlin), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater
   Boddaert) density increased (P < 0.10) from early to late seral stages.
   Burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia Molina), upland sandpiper (Bartramia
   longicauda Bechstein), chestnut-collared longspur (Calcarius ornatus
   Townsend), and horned lark (Eremophild alpestris Linnaeus) density
   decreased (P < 0.10) from early to late seral stages. Western
   meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta Audubon) were more abundant in early (P
   = 0.05) and early-intermediate (P = 0.01) seral stages than late seral
   stages. Birds with habitat requirements including tall vegetation and
   residual cover were more abundant in later seral stages. Early seral
   stages were beneficial to birds that prefer short grass and sparse
   vegetative cover. Seral stage was an effective predictor of density for
   many bird species. A mosaic that includes all seral stages is necessary
   to maximize grassland bird species diversity and abundance across the
   landscape. Managers can assess the effects on grassland birds of
   management actions that alter the seral stage of the vegetation.}},

   Treatments included control, wildlife (mainly big game), and cattle.
   There was less forb standing crop in fall than in early or midsummer,
   but no difference in forb standing crop from early to mid-summer across
   all treatments. There were no differences in graminoid standing crop
   among treatments in 1999, while there was significantly less graminoid

Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-60}},

Abstract = {{The response of species numbers and density of Collembola to
   manipulation of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 32 species) and
   number of plant functional groups (grasses, legumes and non-legume
   herbs) was studied in an experimental grassland at the Swiss BIODEPTH
   site (Lupsingen, Switzerland) in October 1997. Plant species richness or
   number of plant functional groups did not affect total diversity of
   Collembola, however, the number of Collembola species increased in the
   presence of legumes and the grass Trisetum flavescens. The abundance of
   Protaphorura armata increased but that of Hypogastruridae/Neanuridae
   significantly decreased with increasing number of plant functional
   groups. Other groups including the herbivorous Symphypleona did not
   respond to plant species richness and plant functional groups. Possibly,
   Hypogastruridae/Neanuridae species are weak competitors declining in
   density if the density of other Collembola groups increase. In general,
   the effect of the number of plant functional groups on the densities of
   collembolan taxa was stronger than that of plant species richness.
   Changes in Collembola density and diversity in part was likely caused by
   increased soil microbial and fine root biomass in treatments with higher
   plant functional group diversity. The presence of legumes resulted in an
   increase in the densities of total Collembola, Symphypleona/Neelipleona
   and Isotomidae indicating that they benefited from the high litter
   quality and the increased microbial biomass in the rhizosphere of
   legumes. The results suggest that microbivorous soil invertebrates are
   controlled by food quality rather than quantity. Furthermore, they
   indicate that presence of certain plant species and functional groups
   may be more important for collembolan community structure than the
   diversity of plant species and functional groups per se.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical forests exhibit very high spider diversity, but most related
   studies have examined a particular functional group or layer of the
   habitat and few have assessed the impacts of disturbance on tropical
   Araneae diversity. Orchid I. is 92 km off the southeastern coast of
   Taiwan, and its forests are the northernmost tropical forests in East
   Asia. In this study, the spider diversity was compared in 4 types of
   habitats with different degrees of human disturbances on this island.
   Habitat types examined in this study included primary forest, cultivated
   woodlands with a small degree of disturbance, firewood plantations with
   an intermediate level of disturbance, and grasslands generated from the
   clear-cutting of forests. We used 2 replicates for all habitat types,
   each containing four 5 x 5 m sample plots. Spiders from the ground,
   understory shrubs, and canopy were collected to obtain a comprehensive
   representation of diversity from all microhabitats in the sample plots.
   From the 1718 adult specimens obtained, 123 species from 19 families
   were identified. The abundance was the highest in the primary forest and
   lowest in the grassland plots. Plots in the 4 habitat types did riot
   differ in Margalef species richness, Shannon-Weaver function, or Simpson
   index. However, plots in the primary forest had significantly lower
   evenness due to the high relative abundance of dominant orb weaver
   species. Results of a UPGMA analysis using pair-wise Euclidean distances
   showed that the sample plots could be clustered into 4 distinct groups,
   indicating that the composition of spiders among habitat types
   considerably differed. Plots in the primary forest, cultivated woodland,
   and firewood plantation habitats were dominated by space web builders
   and orb weavers, while those in the grasslands contained a much-higher
   proportion of wandering sheet weavers and ground runners. Results of
   this study suggest that various forest management activities conducted
   by the indigenous Yami people seemed to have increased the habitat
   heterogeneity of Orchid I., thus maintaining a high diversity of
   spiders.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by recent global reductions in biodiversity, empirical and
   theoretical research suggests that more species-rich systems exhibit
   enhanced productivity, nutrient cycling, or resistance to disturbance or
   invasion relative to systems with fewer species. In contrast, few data
   are available to assess the potential ecosystem-level importance of
   genetic diversity within species known to play a major functional role.
   Using a manipulative field experiment, we show that increasing genotypic
   diversity in a habitat-forming species (the seagrass Zostera marina)
   enhances community resistance to disturbance by grazing geese. The time
   required for recovery to near predisturbance densities also decreases
   with increasing eelgrass genotypic diversity. However, there is no
   effect of diversity on resilience, measured as the rate of shoot
   recovery after the disturbance, suggesting that more rapid recovery in
   diverse plots is due solely to differences in disturbance resistance.
   Genotypic diversity did not affect ecosystem processes in the absence of
   disturbance. Thus, our results suggest that genetic diversity, like
   species diversity, may be most important for enhancing the consistency
   and reliability of ecosystems by providing biological insurance against
   environmental change.}},

Abstract = {{Field experiments examined herbaceous seedling emergence and survival in
   temperate grassy woodlands on the New England Tablelands of New South
   Wales. Effects of intensity of previous grazing, removal of ground cover
   by fire or clearing, burial of seeds, grazing and seed theft by ants on
   seedling emergence and survival were studied in two field experiments.
   Thirteen species with a range of traits were used in the experiments and
   their cumulative emergence was compared with laboratory germination
   studies. Field emergence correlated to laboratory germination but all
   species had lower emergence in the field. Little natural emergence of
   native species was observed in the field in unsown treatments.
   Short-lived forbs had the highest emergence, followed by perennial
   grasses; rhizomatous graminoids and perennial forbs had the lowest
   emergence. Soil surface and cover treatments did not markedly enhance
   emergence suggesting that intertussock spaces were not prerequisites for
   forb emergence. No consistent pattern of enhanced emergence was found
   for any treatment combination across all species. Seedling survival
   varied among species, with perennial grasses and short-lived forbs
   having the highest seedling mortality. Low mortality rates in the
   graminoids and rhizomatous forbs appeared partially to compensate for
   lower seedling emergence. All perennial grasses and some short-lived
   forbs showed increased risk of mortality with grazing. Differences in
   emergence and survival of species were related to ground cover
   heterogeneity, soil surfaces and, to some extent, herbivory. The
   complexity of these patterns when superimposed on temporal variability
   suggests that no generalizations can be made about the regeneration
   niche of herbaceous species groups. Strong recruitment limitation and
   partitioning of resources in the regeneration niche may reduce
   competition among native species and explain the high species richness
   of the herbaceous layer in the temperate grassy communities of eastern
   Australia.}},

Abstract = {{In some agricultural regions, natural wetlands are scarce, and
   constructed agricultural ponds may represent important alternative
   breeding habitats for amphibians. Properly managed, these agricultural
   ponds may effectively increase the total amount of breeding habitat and
   help to sustain populations. We studied small, constructed agricultural
   ponds in southeastern Minnesota to assess their value as amphibian
   breeding sites. Our study examined habitat factors associated with
   amphibian reproduction at two spatial scales: the pond and the landscape
   surrounding the pond. We found that small agricultural ponds in
   southeastern Minnesota provided breeding habitat for at least 10 species
   of amphibians. Species richness and multispecies reproductive success
   were more closely associated with characteristics of the pond (water
   quality, vegetation, and predators) compared with characteristics of the
   surrounding landscape, but individual species were associated with both
   pond and landscape variables. Ponds surrounded by row crops had similar
   species richness and reproductive success compared with natural wetlands
   and ponds surrounded by non-grazed pasture. Ponds used for watering
   livestock had elevated concentrations of phosphorus, higher turbidity,
   and a trend toward reduced amphibian reproductive success. Species
   richness was highest in small ponds, ponds with lower total nitrogen
   concentrations, tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) present, and
   lacking fish. Multispecies reproductive success was best in ponds with
   lower total nitrogen concentrations, less emergent vegetation, and
   lacking fish. Habitat factors associated with higher reproductive
   success varied among individual species. We conclude that small,
   constructed farm ponds, properly managed, may help sustain amphibian
   populations in landscapes where natural wetland habitat is rare. We
   recommend management actions such as limiting livestock access to the
   pond to improve water quality, reducing nitrogen input, and avoiding the
   introduction of fish.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Using mixtures of 14 calcareous grassland plant species drawn from
   three functional groups, we looked at the effects of elevated
   atmospheric CO2 on contrasting levels of ecosystem performance (species,
   functional group and community). Experimental communities were subjected
   to ambient (approximate to350 mumol mol(-1)) or elevated CO2
   (approximate to600 mumol mol(-1)) in controlled environments, with
   grazing simulated by clipping at monthly intervals for 546 days.
   2. We assessed the effect of elevated CO2 on plant performance by
   quantifying the productivity (biomass) and cover of component species.
   We also examined the effect of elevated CO2 on the vertical structure of
   the plant canopy. Elevated CO2 resulted in a significant increase in
   total community biomass only following nutrient addition. Within
   functional groups, non-leguminous forb species had significantly greater
   biomass and cover in elevated CO2 both before and after nutrient
   addition, although the effect was mainly due to the influence of one
   species (Centaurea nigra). Grasses, in contrast, responded negatively to
   elevated CO2, although again significant reductions in biomass and cover
   could mainly be ascribed to a single species (Brachypodium pinnatum).
   Legumes exhibited increased biomass and cover in elevated CO2 (the
   effects being particularly marked for Anthyllis vulneraria and Lotus
   corniculatus), but this response disappeared following nutrient
   addition. Vertical structure was little affected by CO2 treatment.
   3. We conclude that due to the idiosyncratic responses of individual
   species, the categorization of plants into broad functional groups is of
   limited use in guiding our understanding of the impacts of elevated
   atmospheric CO2 on plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{Current policies for upland pasture management in the UK encourage the
   integration of environmental objectives with livestock production
   through extensification of grazing systems. This study tested the
   hypothesis that a greater sward height in the summer would increase the
   diversity and abundance of grassland beetles (Coleoptera) as has been
   demonstrated for insects of indigenous grasslands.
   The hypothesis was tested with an experiment on an upland sheep pasture
   in mid-Wales. Experimental treatments received different nitrogen
   fertilizer inputs (0 or 50 kg ha(-1)), sheep stocking densities (12 or 9
   ewes ha(-1)) and average sward heights in summer were constrained to 3.5
   or 5.5 cm by conserving surplus grass for silage in subplots. Five
   treatments, replicated in three randomized blocks, combined the two
   stocking densities and two sward heights without nitrogen fertilizer
   inputs, with the fifth combining the higher stocking density, shortest
   sward height and the nitrogen fertilizer input. Beetles were sampled
   with twelve pitfall traps in each of the fifteen plots from June to
   September in 1993 and 1995.
   In years 1 (1993) and 3 (1995) of the experiment, more Coleoptera
   species occurred in the tall sward (an average of nine species in
   addition to the forty-one species present in the sward with the
   conventional sward height). Continuously grazed as opposed to ensiled
   subplots supported more beetle species but fewer individuals. Species
   composition of ground (Carabidae) and rove (Staphylinidae) beetles
   varied between treatments more than the arithmetic differences in
   species number.
   The experimental results supported the hypothesis but the benefits of
   taller swards to species diversity were small in the sown pastures of
   the study compared with indigenous upland grasslands (c. 33\% fewer
   species). Inheritance effects of drainage, fertilizer and lime inputs,
   and the different species and management of cultivated pastures, may
   constrain the conservation benefits of altered pasture management
   compared with indigenous grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the impacts of climate change and defoliation on the
   community structure and plant diversity of a semi-natural temperate
   grassland, monoliths of a permanent grassland were exposed to ambient or
   elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient + 235 ppmv) and
   temperature (ambient + VC) from October 1998 to December 2000. The
   monoliths were subjected to two different cutting frequencies, either
   two or six cuts per year. The grassland community structure changed
   during the course of the experiment and was more responsive to changes
   in management than to changes in climate. Increased cutting frequency
   stimulated plant diversity by enhancing the number of forb species, but
   plant diversity was not significantly affected by climate change. The
   contribution of individual plant species to the vegetation cover
   revealed species-specific responses to climate change and cutting
   frequency, but for most species significant interactions between climate
   change and cutting frequency were present. There were no clear-cut
   effects of treatments on the total annual yield and the proportion of
   forbs present, as significant interactions between climate change and

Abstract = {{Question: Does increasing Festuca canopy cover reduce plant species

   Location: Southeastern Oklahoma, USA.
   Methods: Canopy cover by species, species richness, and litter mass were
   collected within an old-field grassland site on 16, 40 in x 40 in plots.
   Our study was conducted during the first three years of a long-term
   study that investigated the effects of low-level nitrogen enrichment and
   small mammal herbivory manipulations.
   Results: Succession was altered by an increase in abundance of Festuca
   over the 3-yr study period. Species richness did not decline with litter
   accumulation. Instead, Festuca increased most on species-poor plots, and
   Festuca abundance remained low on species-rich plots.

Abstract = {{To better understand how rainforest regenerates after agriculture I
   sampled the seed rain and seed bank, and set out seeds and seedlings, on
   microsites defined by distance to the forest in fields both in Puerto
   Rico and Ecuador. I found that (1) total seeds, species richness and
   life-form richness were twice as great in the Ecuador seed rain compared
   to Puerto Rico but Puerto Rico seeds were more evenly distributed among
   species and (2) total seedlings from the seed bank were similar between
   Puerto Rico and Ecuador, (3) the majority of seeds were lost to
   predation among all species and study sites, (4) seed disease was absent
   in P. aduncum and Miconia prasina, and no seeds germinated for
   Gonzalagunia spicata and P. riparia, (5) in Ecuador pathogenic disease
   claimed more seeds than germinated for all species, and Solanum
   ovalifolium was the only species that had seeds germinate but did not
   lose seeds to disease, (6) also in Ecuador, insect predation was
   significantly lower in the forest border for P. aduncum, and seed
   disease was significantly greater at the 10 m micro site for S.
   ovalifolium, (7) distance has a significant effect on seedling height
   and basal diameter, (8) losses of leaf area due to herbivory and
   pathogens were always low and (9) biomass and leaf specific mass were
   significantly reduced in the border and forest microsites. I conclude
   that Ecuador fields had more seeds, species, and life-forms than Puerto
   Rico fields, predation was the most severe post-dispersal seed filter in
   all fields, seeds that survived predation on Puerto Rico were lost
   either to disease or germination but to both mechanisms in Ecuador, all
   three seed mechanisms in Ecuador fields showed distance effects of
   seedling growth but not survivorship.}},

Abstract = {{Palynological data and pedological investigations including stable
   isotopes and lignin biomarkers (Glaser et al. in press) from a 4 m core
   of Lake Rukche (3500 m a.s.l.) enhance our palaeoecological knowledge of
   the time since the LGM in the Gorkha Himal, Central Nepal. Even before
   15000 B.P. forest types became established which prove the existence in
   Central Nepal of a temperate-humid climate with a considerable amount of
   winter and spring precipitation from westerly disturbances. Lignin input
   and pollen data point to a patchy vegetation cover around Lake Rukche
   with meadow-steppes dominated by Poaceae. Around 15000 B.P. Quercus and
   Pinus roxburghii dominated the lower altitudes while the vegetation
   around Lake Rukche was more steppe-like (Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia).
   Subsequently the climate became warmer and drier as winter and spring
   precipitation decreased while summer rain remained low. Later on more
   resource-demanding forests became established under improved temperature
   and precipitation conditions (Engelhardia). Around Lake Rukche
   coniferous forests (Abies, Picea) occurred beside meadow-steppes. The
   transition from the Pleistocene to the Holocene is not recorded. In the
   Holocene alpine Kobresia-meadows stabilised the soil surface causing
   sand accumulation to end. During the mid-Holocene (7800-2750 B.P.) humid
   oak forests with demanding elements (Ilex, Coriaria, Myrsine and
   Engelhardia) dominated the vegetation cover. A charcoal layer and a
   marked emergence of fire-induced communities with Pinus roxburghii,
   Poaceae, Ericaceae and Pteridium are proofs of a first strong
   anthropogenic change in vegetation which coincided with the climatic
   deterioration at the onset of the Subatlantic. Since 900 B.P. grazing
   pressure and the frequency of fires increased, resulting in a
   replacement of Betula utilis-forests by meadows and woods of Juniperus
   and Rhododendron. While previous anthropogenic influence increased the
   biodiversity by promoting replacement communities, recent developments
   have led to a decrease in biodiversity through loss of natural
   vegetation communities.}},

Abstract = {{We have documented elsewhere, and briefly reviewed here, the anomalously
   high species richness of browsing ungulates (hoofed mammals) in the mid
   Miocene (similar to18-12 Ma) woodland savanna habitats of North America.
   In the mid Miocene these habitats supported substantially more
   brachydont (browsing) species than do any present-day savanna habitats.
   We present some preliminary data to show that such species-rich browser
   communities are not observed after the mid Miocene. The data also
   suggest that these mid Miocene browser communities and their subsequent
   disappearance may have been a global phenomenon. We then focus on
   possible explanations for these observations. We discuss the possibility
   that the high species numbers are a preservational artifact, and
   conclude that taphonomic factors are unlikely to be responsible for the
   level of species richness observed. We then consider various possible
   explanations for high species richness, including the unique aspects of
   climatic change (cooling, drying, increased seasonality), unique biotic
   interactions (the effects of competition, keystone herbivores, changes
   in predator pressure), and consider that none of these are fully
   consistent with the available data. The most likely explanation for the
   observed species-rich browser palaeocommunities is an elevated level of
   primary productivity, relative to the present day, within (at least
   some) mid Miocene grassland habitats. Such an increase in productivity
   could possibly have been the result of higher-than-present levels of
   atmospheric carbon dioxide in the mid Miocene, but this conflicts with
   current interpretations of geochemical evidence, and a satisfactory
   mechanism for the inferred increased primary productivity is an
   unresolved issue. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is recent evidence to suggest that domestic livestock deplete the
   density and diversity of wild herbivores in the cold deserts of the
   Trans-Himalaya by imposing resource limitations. To ascertain the degree
   and nature of threats faced by Himalayan ibex (Capra sibirica) from
   seven livestock species, we studied their resource use patterns over
   space, habitat and food dimensions in the pastures of Pin Valley
   National Park in the Spiti region of the Indian Himalaya. Species diet
   profiles were obtained by direct observations. We assessed the
   similarity in habitat use and diets of ibex and livestock using
   Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling. We estimated the influence of the
   spatial distribution of livestock on habitat and diet choice of ibex by
   examining their co-occurrence patterns in cells overlaid on the
   pastures. The observed co-occurrence of ibex and livestock in cells was
   compared with null-models generated through Monte Carlo simulations. The
   results suggest that goats and sheep impose resource limitations on ibex
   and exclude them from certain pastures. In the remaining suitable
   habitat, ibex share forage with horses. Ibex remained relatively
   unaffected by other livestock such as yaks, donkeys and cattle. However,
   most livestock removed large amounts of forage from the pastures (nearly
   250 kg of dry matter/day by certain species), thereby reducing forage
   availability for ibex. Pertinent conservation issues are discussed in
   the light of multiple-use of parks and current socio-economic
   transitions in the region, which call for integrating social and
   ecological feedback into management planning.}},

Pages = {{1-10}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance may be an important determinant of plant community
   composition and diversity owing to its effects on competitive
   interactions, resources, dominance and vigour. The effect of type,
   timing and frequency of disturbance on grass and forb species richness
   was examined using data from a long-term (> 50 yr) grassland burning and
   mowing experiment in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
   Grass species richness declined considerably (> 50\%) in the absence of
   disturbance, whereas forb species richness was unaffected. Annual
   burning in sites not mown in summer tended to increase grass species
   richness relative to triennial burning (22\% increase) with the reverse
   being true in sites mown twice in summer (37\% decline). Forb species
   richness declined by 25\% in sites mown twice in summer relative to
   sites mown in early summer only. Disturbance was necessary to achieve
   maximum grass species richness presumably by removing litter and
   increasing the availability of light. The interaction of time of mowing
   in summer (early versus late) and time of burning during the dormant
   period (spring versus winter) had the most dramatic effect on species
   richness. Time of burning had no effect on richness in sites mown in
   early summer, but winter burning resulted in a dramatic decline
   (27-42\%) in richness in sites mown in late summer. This effect may be
   related to possible greater soil desiccation with this combination of
   disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{To assess whether winter mowing in wetlands fulfils the aim of
   preventing succession towards drier communities, 34 permanent quadrats
   (15 m(2)) were surveyed annually from 1984-1985 to 2000 within large
   mown and unmown (control) areas (several ha) in a calcareous lake shore
   fen (W Switzerland). Three trends were noticed: decrease of aquatic
   species, spread of Cladium mariscus and establishment of woody species
   (especially Alnus glutinosa and Frangula alnus). None of these trends
   was prevented by mowing, but mowing did prevent the accumulation of C.
   mariscus litter and kept woody saplings small. Succession was generally
   slow and often occurred in the form of sudden, discrete changes. Plant
   species richness increased with mowing and remained constant without
   mowing. Soil disturbance by the mowing machine contributed more to the
   effects of management on species composition than the periodic removal
   of biomass. It is concluded that mowing every three years in winter is

   sufficient to maintain the plant species richness of a low productive,

Abstract = {{This study relates patterns of butterfly abundance and species richness

   butterflies from the Papilionidae, Pieridae, Lycaenidae, Nymphalidae,
   and Hesperiidae families. Of the total 26 observed species, 15 were
   noticeably absent from the disturbed sites. Butterfly assemblages had
   equal or higher number of individuals and species richness at moderately
   disturbed sites compared with the least disturbed sites. In relation to
   distribution patterns along the gradient, 28\% of butterfly species were
   classified as disturbance adaptable and 58\% as disturbance avoiders.
   These classifications were correlated with host-plant use and voltinism.
   Canonical correspondence analysis of local-scale data strongly
   associated disturbance avoiders with a specific environmental variable
   (e.g., Everes comyntas (Godart, 1824) with grasslands), whereas
   disturbance-adaptable species were weakly associated with any variable.
   One-time disturbances (i.e., mowing) during the survey resulted in
   pronounced changes in butterfly abundance and species composition at two
   sites, reducing species richness and total abundance by up to 80\%.
   Species were patchily distributed along the gradient, suggesting that
   they respond differentially to disturbance in the landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Ecology is founded on the view that ecosystem properties like

   environmental change may cause abrupt shifts to alternate states. In
   many ecosystems, top predators play a pivotal role in controlling plant
   productivity and diversity. Yet it remains uncertain if altering this
   control shifts systems to alternate states. I report on a test of the
   hypothesis that loss of predator control of ecosystem function causes
   abrupt state changes in diversity and productivity. In this meadow
   ecosystem, predators enhance plant diversity by causing a highly
   productive, competitively dominant plant species to be suppressed by
   herbivores. Experimental predator removal caused rapid proliferation of
   the competitively dominant plant. Moreover, temporally staggered
   predator reintroductions failed to restore the ecosystem. This loss of
   resilience confirmed that the ecosystem crossed a critical threshold and
   entrained into an alternate state.}},

Abstract = {{Many range managers have suggested that clubmoss (Selaginella densa
   Rydb.) negatively alters the composition of seed banks and inhibits the
   establishment of plant species that decrease under improper grazing
   management. Alternatively it is possible that soil seed banks contain
   few seeds of decreaser species and composition of the seed bank is
   independent of clubmoss. The purpose of this study was to determine the
   composition and diversity of the soil seed bank in relation to the
   clubmoss cover and compositional characteristics of plant communities in
   the Northern Mixed Prairie of southwestern Saskatchewan. Cover of
   vascular plants was determined and soil seed bank samples were collected
   in 100 grazed plant communities. Soil seed bank samples were incubated
   in the laboratory with emerging seedlings being identified to species.
   Eight percent (SE +/- 1.9) of emerging seedlings in the seed bank were
   decreasers, 73\% (SE +/- 2.8) were increasers, and 19\% (SE +/- 2.3)
   were invaders, indicating regeneration of decreaser species might be
   limited by low numbers of seeds in seed banks. Clubmoss cover was not
   correlated (P = 0.32 to 0.98) with species richness, species diversity,
   density of decreasers, density of increasers, density of invaders, and
   total seedling densities in the seed banks. Seed banks and plant
   communities shared few species as indicated by a low similarity index

Abstract = {{Although biological invasion by alien species is a major contributor to
   loss of indigenous biological diversity, few studies have examined the
   susceptibility of the boreal biome to invasion. Based on studies of
   other ecosystems, we hypothesized that alien plants will be restricted
   to disturbed areas near human activity and will not be found in natural
   areas of boreal ecosystems in Gros Morne National Park (Canada), a
   protected area experiencing a wide range of disturbance regimes. The
   distribution of alien plants in the region was evaluated using surveys,
   and study sites were established in naturally and anthropogenically
   disturbed habitats that had been invaded. Within study sites,
   randomization tests evaluated the importance of disturbance to alien
   plant invasion by examining changes in environmental conditions and
   species abundance within various disturbance regimes, while the
   importance of site characteristics limiting the distribution of alien
   plants were examined using Canonical Correspondence Analysis. Consistent
   with studies in a variety of biomes, areas of high disturbance and human
   activity had the greatest abundance of resources and the highest
   percentage of alien species. However, contrary to our hypothesis,
   natural areas of boreal ecosystems were found susceptible to alien plant
   invasion. Vegetation types vulnerable to invasion include forests,
   riparian areas, fens, and alpine meadows. Natural disturbance occurring
   in these vegetation types caused increases in bare ground and/or light
   availability facilitating alien plant invasion. Although high soil pH
   was associated with alien plants in these areas, disturbance was not
   found to cause changes in soil pH, suggesting susceptibility to invasion
   is pre-determined by bedrock geology or other factors influencing soil
   pH. Moose (Alces alces), a non-native herbivore, acts as the primary
   conduit for alien plant invasion in GMNP by dispersing propagules and
   creating or prolonging disturbance by trampling and browsing vegetation.
   The recurrent nature of disturbance within the boreal biome and its
   interaction with site conditions and herbivores enables alien plants to
   persist away from areas of high human activity. Managers of natural
   lands should monitor such interactions to decrease the invasion
   potential of alien plants.}},

Volume = {{116}},

Abstract = {{The UK Biodiversity Action Plan has identified the creation of lowland
   heathland as an important objective. Heathland restoration studies have
   identified soil pH, elevated soil nutrients and large weed seed banks as
   major problems in the restoration of heathland vegetation on ex-arable
   land. Heathland vegetation is usually found on nutrient-poor acidic
   soils. Creating acidic soil conditions on ex-arable sites thus may
   produce a suitable environment for the establishment of heath
   vegetation. Soil acidification by the addition of sulphur has been shown
   to reduce the soil pH and the availability of nutrients in arable soils.
   A series of experiments was established to investigate the effects of
   soil acidification using sulphur on the establishment of Calluna
   vulgaris and the development of weed vegetation. The application of
   sulphur at 0.24 kg m(-2) to an arable soil was found to increase the
   survival rate of C. vulgaris cuttings planted in it. The mechanism of
   increased C. vulgaris survival appeared to be by sulphur application
   significantly reducing the cover of arable weeds arising from the soil
   seed bank. Higher rates of sulphur application (0.36 and 0.48 kg m(-2))
   resulted in the death of many C. vidgaris plants. However C. vulgaris
   seedlings were able to establish successfully on these ex-arable soils
   within 1824 months following the addition of these levels of sulphur.
   The application of sulphur appears to offer a practical solution to
   heathland creation on ex-arable land. However, it may be necessary to
   provide an interval of between 18 and 24 months between the application
   of sulphur and the addition of C. vulgaris plants or seeds for the
   successful establishment of heathland vegetation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The arthropod species richness of pastures in three Azorean islands was
   used to examine the relationship between local and regional species
   richness over two years. Two groups of arthropods, spiders and sucking
   insects, representing two functionally different but common groups of
   pasture invertebrates were investigated. The local-regional species
   richness relationship was assessed over relatively fine scales: quadrats
   (= local scale) and within pastures (= regional scale). Mean plot
   species richness was used as a measure of local species richness (=
   alpha diversity) and regional species richness was estimated at the
   pasture level (= gamma diversity) with the `first-order-Jackknife'
   estimator. Three related issues were addressed: (i) the role of
   estimated regional species richness and variables operating at the local
   scale (vegetation structure and diversity) in determining local species
   richness; (ii) quantification of the relative contributions of alpha and
   beta diversity to regional diversity using additive partitioning; and
   (iii) the occurrence of consistent patterns in different years by
   analysing independently between-year data. Species assemblages of
   spiders were saturated at the local scale (similar local species
   richness and increasing beta-diversity in richer regions) and were more
   dependent on vegetational structure than regional species richness.
   Sucking insect herbivores, by contrast, exhibited a linear relationship
   between local and regional species richness, consistent with the
   proportional sampling model. The patterns were consistent between years.
   These results imply that for spiders local processes are important, with
   assemblages in a particular patch being constrained by habitat
   structure. In contrast, for sucking insects, local processes may be
   insignificant in structuring communities.}},

Abstract = {{Restoration practice suggests that neighbor control is essential in
   semiarid grasslands, but ecological theory predicts that neighbor
   effects are relatively small in young fields. We investigated the
   effectiveness of neighbor control (mowing and herbicide) for
   establishing native grasses in a recently abandoned field in
   southwestern Saskatchewan, Canada. We also examined its interactions
   with common restoration techniques, such as mulching (straw. and
   sawdust) and contrasting sowing methods (drilling, and broadcasting
   cleaned seeds, cleaning remainders, and native hay). The experiment was
   repeated over three years to examine the effect of weather. Neighbor
   control had no effect on establishment and rarely any effect on
   first-year survival. This contrasted with significant effects of
   neighbor control on community and ecosystem-level variables (species
   richness, water, N). The lack of neighbor effects is concordant with
   theory which predicts low competition intensity from ruderal annuals.
   Establishment in seeded plots varied two-fold among years in drilled
   plots and 50-fold in broadcast plots, and it was lowest during a cool,
   dry summer. Thus, variables beyond human control are a major factor
   determining restoration success. Overall, broadcasting was as effective
   as drilling. The highest long-term establishment of native species was
   produced by broadcasting cleaning remainders. Almost no seedlings
   emerged from plots supplied with native hay. Straw mulch increased soil
   moisture and available N, and sawdust decreased N, but neither had any
   long-term effect on native grasses. Our results suggest that
   restorations of semiarid old fields should focus less on neighbor
   control and more on strategies for exploiting suitable years for
   germination, either by monitoring soil moisture or through repeated
   seeding.}},

Abstract = {{Aim The research aim is to reconstruct last glacial maximum (LGM) and
   Holocene vegetation history and ecology from fossil beetle assemblages.
   Location The LGM and Holocene sites are located in the Awatere Valley,
   which lies in the tectonically active Marlborough Region in the north
   east of the South Island of New Zealand.
   Methods Beetle fossils were extracted from silty organic sediment using
   the standard kerosene flotation method. Fossils were identified by
   comparisons made to modern species based on morphology and surface
   features. The ecology and distribution of modern analogues are
   extrapolated to reconstruct the fossil environment.
   Results One hundred and forty-five beetle species belonging to 33
   families were identified. The LGM fossil fauna showed the local
   vegetation was characterized by a forest patch surrounded by an open
   tussock/grassland landscape. This Nothofagus (southern beech) forest
   persisted at the site until mid-Holocene when it was replaced by a
   podocarp forest that contained high beetle diversity. Herbivores
   dominate in the early stage of this zone, indicating a relatively new
   forest environment. Later in the Holocene, the fauna is dominated by
   detritivores indicating an older more established forest. The late
   Holocene is characterized by low diversity and the absence of forest
   species. This fauna indicates that by 500 years ago, the forest was
   absent and is associated with an almost compete loss of beetle
   biodiversity.
   Main conclusions The fossil beetles provide a unique perspective into
   the past environment in the Awatere Valley on a local scale. The
   reconstruction supports regional pollen interpretations of Holocene
   vegetation by identifying a specific forest patch. Fossil beetles are
   thus a valuable local proxy for vegetation reconstructions.}},

   ecosystem}},
Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{One cornerstone of ecological theory is that nutrient availability
   limits the number of species that can inhabit a community. However, the
   relationship between the spatial distribution of limiting nutrients and
   species diversity is not well established because there is no single
   scale appropriate for measuring variation in resource distribution.
   Instead, the correct scale for analyzing resource variation depends on
   the range of species sizes within the community. To quantify the
   relationship between nutrient distribution and plant species diversity,
   we measured NO3- distribution and plant species diversity in 16 paired,
   modified Whittaker grassland plots in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania.
   Semivariograms were used to quantify the spatial structure of NO3- from
   scales of 0.4-26 m. Plant species diversity (Shannon-Weiner diversity
   index; H') was quantified in 1-m(2) plots, while plant species richness
   was measured at multiple spatial scales between 1 and 1,000 m(2).
   Small-scale variation in NO3- (<0.4 m) was positively correlated with
   1-m(2) H `, while 1,000-m(2) species richness was a log-normal function
   of average NO3- patch size. Nine of the 16 grassland plots had a fractal
   (self-similar across scales) NO3- spatial distribution; of the nine
   fractal plots, five were adjacent to plots that had a non-fractal
   distribution of NO3-. This finding offered the unique opportunity to
   test predictions of Ritchie and Olff (1999): when the spatial
   distribution of limiting resources is fractal, communities should
   display a left-skewed log-size distribution and a log-normal
   relationship between net primary production and species richness. These
   predictions were supported by comparisons of plant size distributions
   and biomass-richness relationships in paired plots, one with a fractal
   and one with a non-fractal distribution of NO3-. In addition, fractal
   plots had greater large-scale richness than paired non-fractal plots
   (1,0-1000 m(2)), but neither species diversity (H') nor richness was
   significantly different at small scales (1 m(2)). This result is most
   likely explained by differences in the scale of resource variation among
   plots: fractal and non-fractal plots had equivalent NO3- variation at
   small scales but differed in NO3- variation at large scales (as measured
   by the fractal dimension). We propose that small-scale variation in NO3-
   is largely due to the direct effects of plants on soil, while patterns
   of species richness at large scales is controlled by the patch size and
   fractal dimension of NO3- in the landscape. This study provides an
   important empirical step in understanding the relationship between the
   spatial distribution of resources and patterns of species diversity
   across multiple spatial scales.}},

Abstract = {{This study quantified species and functional group diversity in a
   grassland plant community in southwestern Montana. Specific objectives
   were to measure the richness and density of functional groups within the
   grassland community, measure the biomass of each functional group, and
   calculate diversity indices for each functional group. We hypothesized
   that diversity would be greater than previous descriptions for the
   Festuca idahoensis/Agropyron spicatum habitat type because our
   multiple-season method would recognize seasonal and environmental
   variations in community composition. Of the species present, we
   hypothesized that forb functional groups account for the majority of
   richness and biomass of this grassland plant community Species richness
   and density were measured during spring, summer, and fall of 2000, and
   biomass was collected during spring, summer, and fall of 2001. Species
   richness was measured by counting all species present on 4-m(2) plots.
   We measured forb density per 4-m(2) plot and determined grass density by
   counting tillers per species within a 0.2x0.5-m frame. Diversity indices
   were calculated for each functional group. Biomass by functional group
   was clipped front three 0.2x0.5-m frames per 4-m(2) plot. Data support
   the hypothesis that multiple-season sampling recognizes greater species
   diversity at one location because both sites were more diverse plant
   communities than previously described for this habitat type. We
   documented 14 graminoids and 69 forbs front just 2 sites. Total
   diversity of a 4-m(2) plot averaged 42 species, consisting of 5 grasses,
   12 deep-rooted forbs, and 25 shallow-rooted forbs. Our data also support
   the hypothesis that forb functional groups represent the majority of the
   richness and biomass of the grassland community. Forbs account for 83\%
   of species richness in this research. In addition, forbs represent a
   greater proportion of plant biomass than grasses on our sites.
   Functional group diversity and forb diversity should be a larger
   consideration in Festuca idahoensis/Agropyron spicatum grassland
   management decisions. We recommend that land managers recognize forb
   species and forb functional group diversity in grassland
   classifications. Maintaining diversity should be a primary objective of
   land managers because increased diversity has been found to increase
   community stability and productivity and decrease the risk of invasion
   by undesired species. To encourage land managers to put more resources
   into monitoring diversity, a simple and repeatable sampling procedure
   applicable to both community and landscape scales needs to be developed.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive data set of Czech wet meadow vegetation (Calthion
   alliance) and relevant environmental data were collected and published
   by E. Balatova in 1972-1997. This paper presents a synthesis of this
   phytosociological data set with the aim of (i) finding the main
   gradients in Calthion wet meadow vegetation and relating them to soil
   chemistry factors, (11) comparing soil chemistry within different soil
   depths and various vegetation types and (ill) evaluating each soil
   chemistry variable with respect to its ability to explain variation in
   wet meadow vegetation. Correspondence analysis revealed that vegetation
   changes along two major gradients of the same importance: (1) from
   species-rich communities to the species-poor, tall-forb communities of
   highly-productive habitats and (ii) from neutrophytic communities to
   acidophytic communities, mostly of mountain habitats. The first PCA axis
   of environmental variables is clearly identified as the axis of acidity,
   the second one as the axis of nutrients. The factors connected with soil
   acidity and base saturation (e. g. pH, H+, Al3+, Ca2+) are
   inter-correlated, and they are the most important of the measured
   factors for vegetation composition. This is also reflected in
   traditional phytosociological classification. Nutrients (N, P, K) are
   also inter-correlated and explain less, but still a very significant
   part of vegetation variation. However, the Filipendulenion communities,
   which often developed after cessation of mowing or as a result of
   eutrophication, are only weakly differentiated according to the amount
   of available soil nutrients. This apparent paradox is presumably caused
   by nutrient depletion during the development of these highly-productive
   stands. A relationship between their development and calcium
   concentration in the topmost soil layer has also been found.}},

Abstract = {{Summer farming was formerly an important part of Norwegian husbandry and
   mountain areas have been used for grazing for hundreds of years. A
   decline in summer farming practices, during the twentieth century, has
   caused a large-scale encroachment of trees and shrubs leading to
   extensive landscape changes and decreased biodiversity. Therefore, in
   order to maintain the biodiversity in summer farm mountain areas, it is
   now necessary to detect, map and monitor remaining species-rich
   fragments, i.e. key habitats. It is also important to identify still
   grass- and herb-rich areas that can be successfully restored for grazing
   because of a new interest for summer farming. Field surveys in the
   re-growing mountain areas are extremely time consuming, as the
   concomitant terrain renders movement by foot arduous. A method was thus
   developed for detection of key-habitats and other grass and herb-rich
   habitats in such areas based on interpretation of coloured infrared
   aerial photographs (CIR). In addition, black-and-white aerial
   photographs, taken nearly 40 years ago, were used to identify past open
   land and pastures and thus in combination with the modern ones allow the
   identification of areas that exhibit a continuity in grazing.
   Interpretation keys were developed and vegetation maps were constructed.
   The interpretation from the aerial photographs was compared to detailed
   field control and the method was found to be efficient and accurate. The
   method gave useful information about the landscape history and
   continuity of grazing. The cattle's movements were traced by GPS
   equipment mounted on a collar on the leading cattle, and their movements
   were later transferred to a map and analysed together with the
   vegetation map in a GIS. The results show that the cattle preferred to
   graze in the areas identified as most valuable and species rich. The
   developed method also makes it possible to identify areas for which
   pasture-restoration might be successfully achieved. Furthermore, the
   study revealed that there is a high correspondence between key habitats
   in the summer farming areas and grazing preferences of the cattle. (C)

Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{17-27}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{To meet conservation goals it is necessary to assess vegetation status
   and to be able to monitor effects of management and environmental
   change. In northern Europe grazed grasslands are one of the most
   threatened habitat in the rural landscape and thus in focus for
   conservation plans. At present managers use species indicator list to
   assess past and present management status of grassland and succession
   stages in particular, as well as effects of the environment. However,
   these indicators have rarely been scientifically tested.
   In this study we discuss if plant functional traits may be a key to
   select suitable indicator species for monitoring land-use change in
   Swedish rural landscape. The suitability of two possible monitoring
   tools: (i) plant species selected from functional traits (PFTs) and (ii)
   indicator species commonly used today to assess grassland management
   status, were tested along two gradients, a succession gradient and a
   wetness gradient. We found no association between successional change
   and plant functional traits, but a response in plant functional traits
   was found along the wetness gradient. However, the more common
   ``non-scientific{''} indicator species responded fairly well to the
   varying gradient categories along both gradients. We believe that there
   is a need to further validate the ecological mechanisms behind the
   present-day indicators and to place them in a geographical context. (C)

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In the semi-arid rangelands of the Oshana ecosystem in Northern Namibia,
   there are general concerns that artificial water points for domestic use
   contribute to the processes that lead to desertification. The processes
   begin in piospheres of artificial water points. Among the processes
   suggested to correlate with radial distance and age of water points are
   loss of perennial grass species, an increase in annuals, and general
   loss of herbaceous species richness, herbaceous biomass and grass cover,
   as well as an increase in forb cover and in bare ground and litter
   cover. Radial distance and age of artificial water points impacts were
   compared using these indicators with benchmarks in saline grassland and
   mopane landscape at the end of the wet season. Radial distance
   influenced herbaceous species richness, grass cover and bare ground,
   while the variability of the perennial:annual grass ratio, herbaceous
   biomass, forb and litter cover were attributed to differences between
   landscape types. Age of water points influenced only herbaceous species
   richness, while forb cover was associated more with water points than
   benchmarks. Forb cover was sporadic in relation to age of water points.
   In the Oshana ecosystem, therefore, radial-grazing distance could not be
   used to explain changes in the perennial:annual grass ratio. Many of the
   changes were explained by differences between landscape types. The
   mopane landscape was more vulnerable to degradation induced by
   artificial water points than the grassland landscape. The implication is
   that, in the future, greater care should be taken to space water points
   in the mopane landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Under the Kyoto Protocol industrialized countries will be able to meet
   carbon emission reduction commitments by financing forestry projects
   that sequester carbon in developing countries. While this mechanism
   would compensate for missing markets in forest environmental services,
   it could also enable industrialized countries to avoid reducing energy
   use. This paper assesses whether such projects could contribute to
   improved logging practices in the tropics. Results from studies
   primarily in Asia and Latin America are analyzed in the context of the
   modalities of the Kyoto Protocol. Results show that the opportunity cost
   of shifting from conventional logging to improved practices may have
   been underestimated. At the same time the long-term carbon and
   biodiversity benefits of improved forest management may have been
   underestimated. These results follow primarily from the fact that most
   previous studies assume that a permanent forest estate is maintained
   under conventional logging and that cutting cycles are as long as 30-60
   years. A more realistic scenario, however, consists of repeated
   harvesting at short intervals during the first few decades, resulting in
   the degradation of the forest into shrub and grassland. The implications
   of these results are that forest management projects may be less
   cost-effective than previously assumed. Therefore, expectations about
   their potential contribution to improved management should be scaled
   down. At the same time, the extent to which such projects will enable
   industrialized countries to avoid reducing industrial pollution is also
   unlikely to be significant. Cost-effectiveness is likely to be highest
   where timber volumes in the first few decades after initial logging are
   comparable under conventional and improved logging. This is likely where
   topography is relatively flat, biodiversity values are low, wastage of
   felled timber is high and the policy environment is favorable. A number
   of proactive measures are suggested to expand the niche for forest
   management carbon projects. These measures are justified because the
   incremental carbon and biodiversity benefits in the long run may be
   higher than previous studies have indicated. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{A small-plot field experiment on grazed hill country pastures in the
   North Island of New Zealand was conducted to examine the productivity
   and compositional characteristics of swards in response to variation in
   pasture species diversity. The balanced incomplete factorial design
   incorporated variation in location, slope, soil fertility and
   combinations of eight plant functional groups (C-4 grasses, annual
   grasses, annual legumes, perennial C-3 grasses, perennial legumes,
   perennial forbs, ryegrass and browntop). Net herbage accumulation and
   botanical composition were measured at 18 months (spring) and 24 months
   (autumn) after oversowing following application of a systemic herbicide.
   Analysis of variance indicated a significant positive relationship
   between the number of functional groups sown and herbage accumulation of
   the sown species in spring, but not with total herbage accumulation.
   Regression analysis showed that herbage accumulation was also affected
   by the identity of the functional groups. However, the statistical
   models indicated that pasture productivity was most strongly influenced
   by site factors. There was a significant negative relationship between
   both the number and herbage accumulation of unsown species and the
   number of functional groups sown, indicating a positive relationship
   between diversity and resistance to invasion by unsown species. A
   comparison of the vegetation between the plots before and after
   oversowing showed that those more diverse prior to sowing returned to
   their initial composition more rapidly, evidence that diverse vegetation
   was more resilient in the face of disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Geologically isolated, natural grazing refuges that have never been

   This study compared refuges protected from grazing by ravines to
   adjacent grazed sites in an uncommon grassland type in eastern Colorado.
   We also tested whether differences between refuge and grazed sites were
   due to protection from grazing versus abiotic conditions, based on
   temporary caging of little bluestem plants (Schizachyrium scoparium
   {[}Michaux] Nash). Regionally rare species were not exclusive to
   refuges, but occurred also on adjacent grazed sites. However, refuges
   showed greater species richness, as well as greater abundance of several
   tall stature species that are uncommon in the surrounding shortgrass
   steppe. Temporary protection of little bluestem plants in grazed sites
   resulted in significant changes in growth and reproductive output, in
   the direction of refuge plants. Though this geological refuge did not
   manifest an exclusive set of rare species as reported from other
   systems, it does preserve strong source populations of uncommon species
   that are sensitive to grazing and thereby contributes to regional

Title = {{Recovery, invasion, and decline over 37 years in a Marlborough
   short-tussock grassland, New Zealand}},

Abstract = {{The composition of humid, unfertilised, short-tussock
   (Festuca-Rytidosperma-Poa) grasslands was recorded on 42 permanent
   transects in 1959, 1970-72, and 1995-96 in the Wairau catchment,
   Marlborough. Changes in frequency of the most abundant plant species and
   bare ground were analysed. Reduced levels of grazing, browsing, and fire
   prompted significant recovery of native shrubs, tall tussocks
   (Chionochloa), and herbs. Invasive exotics (Hieracium, Anthoxanthum,
   Agrostis) also increased. Short native grasses (Poa, Elymus), a native
   herb (Acaena spp.), and an exotic herb (Rumex acetosella) declined.
   Hieracium pilosella, H. caespitosum, and H. lepidulum were rare or
   absent in 1959. By 1996 they had established on half the transects, but
   were still in the early stages of invasion (median frequencies less than
   or equal to 5\%). There was no correlation between the increase in
   Hieracium and decline in other species, suggesting that other factors
   were driving the compositional changes. However, Hieracium species can
   establish in vegetated microsites and eventually dominate. Early in the
   invasion a lack of correlation may reflect a capacity for short-tussock
   grasslands to ``absorb{''} exotic species before interference becomes
   intense. Compared with five documented examples of more heavily infested
   tussock grasslands, the Wairau was the only one where the proportion of
   increasing species exceeded the proportion that decreased. This may
   indicate a threshold level of Hieracium, beyond which interference
   becomes involved in species declines. These grasslands will continue to
   change as native species continue to recover and potentially dominant
   Hieracium and exotic grasses continue to invade. In such grasslands,
   conservation management would benefit from integrating the inevitability
   of vegetation change with the need to optimise indigenous biodiversity.
   In appropriate areas, actively promoting long-term succession to native
   woody vegetation and tall-tussock grassland would result in communities
   that have high conservation values and higher resistance to exotic
   invaders such as Hieracium.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of local communities to control introduced plants is called
   biotic resistance. Biotic resistance has been almost exclusively tested
   for plant competition and above-ground herbivores and pathogens, while
   neglecting root herbivores and soil pathogens. Here, we present biotic
   resistance by above- and below-ground herbivores in concert, and relate
   the abundance of the plant enemies to the species diversity of the local
   plant communities. The study was carried out in a 7-year-old
   biodiversity field experiment. We used creeping thistle (Cirsium
   arvense) as a model, and quantified sap-sucking herbivores: aboveground
   aphids, their antagonists, and root-feeding nematodes. As plant
   diversity treatments, we used field plots sown with high (15 plant
   species, HSD) or low (4 plant species, LSD) diverse seed mixtures in
   1996 and that were not weeded. Creeping thistle became established
   spontaneously at the start of the experiment. In 2002, in HSD plots,
   90\% of the plant community was made up by 11 species, compared to seven
   species in LSD plots. No differences were found for C. arvense abundance
   or biomass. Aboveground, three aphid species were found on C.
   orvense-Uroleucon cirsii, Aphis fabae, and Macrosiphum euphorbiae, but
   the latter was found only in low densities. Significantly more aphid
   species were found on individual plants in HSD plots. Moreover, in HSD
   plots, on average 10\% of aphids were parasitized, while no parasitism
   was observed in LSD plots. In the root zone of C arvense, significantly
   more nematodes were found in HSD than in LSD plots, and a significantly
   higher proportion of those nematodes were plant parasites. The dominant
   plant parasitic nematode in both treatments was Paratylenchus. We
   conclude that biotic resistance by natural enemies may be enhanced by
   plant species diversity, but that above- and below-ground sap-sucking
   herbivores do not necessarily have to respond similarly to the diversity
   of the surrounding plant community.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The impact of introduced herbivores on the composition and structure of
   plant communities has been widely studied. However, little is known
   about how they affect wildlife. We studied the impact of feral horses
   under different grazing regimes on the communities of birds in a nature
   reserve in the Pampas grasslands in Argentina. The areas that had
   predominantly tall grass (enclosures and areas of moderate grazing
   intensity) showed the greatest species richness and total abundance of
   birds. Some species, e,g. the southern lapwing (Vanellits chilensis),
   were associated with the presence of horses, while others, e.g. pipits
   (Anthus spp), were more common in lesser grazed areas. The presence of
   feral horses was associated with an increase in the rate of predation of
   eggs which varied from 12.5\% within the enclosures to 70\% in grazed
   areas. It is suggested that the increase in predation rate was due to
   the increased visibility of the nests and an increase in the density of
   opportunist carnivores. Small areas of grassland in a good state of
   conservation could serve as sources that would maintain communities of
   birds in the more transformed sections.}},

Abstract = {{Agri-environment schemes are one of the main policy initiatives for

   Farmers entering into scheme agreements must adopt environmentally
   beneficial management practices. Results of botanical monitoring
   programmes, of duration up to 8 years for schemes in the four UK
   countries, are reviewed in the context of the UK Biodiversity Action
   Plan (BAP). No change was detected in 22 out of 38 samples (sets of
   quadrats or plots) of semi-natural grassland, implying maintenance of
   quality; some rehabilitation (improvement in condition) occurred in nine
   samples, but seven deteriorated. Some signs of reversion to grassland of
   biodiversity value (restoration) were detected in 9 out of 30 samples of
   agriculturally improved or semi-improved grassland. Rehabilitation or
   restoration usually coincided with low fertiliser input or changes in
   grazing intensity, and often occurred in western locations or the upland
   fringe. Deterioration was mostly due to inappropriate grazing intensity
   or altered hydrological regime. Greater use of site-specific targets and
   prescriptions would enhance future scheme performance and monitoring.

Abstract = {{Quick biodiversity studies on poorly studied taxa and areas are
   increasingly popular for setting conservation priorities over a wide
   range of spatial scales. However, the implementation of such studies is
   complicated by the variable extent to which the different criteria used
   in prioritisation are correlated to each other. Using methods of
   constrained ordination, we examined the species-habitat relationships of
   carabid beetles based on ground beetle assemblages from 22 sites in the
   Picos de Europa National Park, northern Spain. We found characteristic
   species assemblages for subalpine meadows, Genista shrublands, and
   pastures, whereas mown meadows. heathlands, beech and riparian woodlands
   were occupied by more habitat generalist species. Species associated
   with subalpine meadows and Genista shrublands tended to be mostly
   brachypterous and to have geographic ranges restricted to northern
   Spain. In contrast, we found no relationship between the degree of
   species' association with pastures and geographic range-wing size type.
   Although the species richness was higher in riparian woodlands and mown
   meadows, we suggest a higher conservation value for subalpine meadows
   and Genista shrublands across the landscape because they sustain
   characteristic assemblages dominated by species with restricted ranges
   and reduced powers of dispersal. Our study suggests that preserving
   areas in the landscape supporting higher biodiversity will not
   necessarily preserve those species potentially more susceptible to
   habitat loss and fragmentation. It also supports the feasibility of
   biodiversity studies based on multivariate techniques for setting
   conservation priorities over complex landscapes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Pages = {{21-32}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Many grasslands and arable fields have been abandoned in Europe in the
   last decades. So far, however, ecologists have not been able to
   establish one general, unifying theory for successionally induced
   chances in species composition following abandonment. In fact, the
   course of succession seems to be unique for each site and year. Here we
   focused on the analysis of plant functional traits in order to detect
   general trends in trait responses to succession which would prove
   independent of site characteristics. We studied permanent plot series of
   14 grassland sites in SW Germany that had been abandoned for 25 yr.
   Species composition as well as the course of succession varied
   significantly among the grasslands.
   Response to succession was analysed for the following traits: `plant
   height', `canopy structure', `specific leaf area' (SLA), `storage
   organs, `vegetative spread', `plant persistence', `seed bank longevity.
   `start of flowering', `duration of flowering' and `seed mass'. We
   compared a univariate with a multi-variate approach. In the univariate
   approach, attributes of each trait were analysed separately employing
   GLM whereas in the multivariate approach all traits were handled
   together in NMS. Both analyses indicated similar trait responses to
   succession. There was a significant increase in the proportion of
   species characterized by the following attributes: plant height > 0.6 in
   leaves distributed regularly along the stern, vegetative spread > 100
   mm. start of flowering later than May, duration of flowering 1-2 months
   and seeds of either low or high mass.}},

   relationship and interactions among disturbances, we subjected wet
   prairie assemblages within 1.1 m(2) mesocosms to invasion by Phalaris
   and addition of nutrients, sediments, and flooding. Species richness
   decreased with the application of sediments and/or flooding of 4
   consecutive weeks or longer. Losses of up to six dominant and

   through the plant canopy by as much as 400\% over the control. Light
   availability in July and September was a strong predictor of
   end-of-season aboveground biomass of Phalaris. Phalaris was also 35\%
   and 195\% more productive when nutrients were added at low and high
   levels, respectively. Multiple factors in combination were usually
   additive in their effects on invasion, but sediments and nutrients
   interacted with flood regime to synergistically increase invasion in

Abstract = {{The relationship between vegetation growth rate, quality, litter
   decomposition and diversity was investigated in four grazed grasslands
   differing in topography, management and fertility in the southern North
   Island of New Zealand. Vegetation samples were clipped at two sampling
   times (summer and autumn) from 0.5 m(2) areas excluded from grazing.
   Crude protein (CP), in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), neutral
   detergent fiber (NDF), average daily growth (ADG) rate, species
   composition and the relative extent of tissue degradation by soil
   microorganisms were determined for the vegetation samples.
   It was hypothesized that vegetation diversity would be negatively
   related with measures of vegetation growth, quality and decomposition.
   Comparisons made across all environmental and management conditions
   agreed with the hypotheses. Higher vegetation diversity was associated
   with lower ADG rate, lower CP concentrations, lower IVDMD and higher NDF
   concentrations. Comparisons within management regimes (MR), however,
   were less consistent and possible reasons for this are examined. Litter
   decomposition extent was closely related to the tissue quality
   characteristics of the vegetation, especially NDF concentration, but not
   species diversity.
   The observed local-scale relationships between the vegetation diversity,
   growth, quality and decomposition characteristics were contended to be
   largely the result of the influence of environmental resource richness
   on community structure of the managed grasslands studied. There is a
   need to promote a functionally diverse plant community over the entire
   managed area rather than promoting high localized species diversity
   within grasslands. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing interest in the development of livestock grazing
   management strategies that achieve environmental sustainability and
   maintain or improve the long-term production capacity of commercial
   grazing systems. In temperate Australia, these strategies are generally
   focussed on reducing perennial pasture decline, soil loss, acidity, and
   salinity. An additional challenge facing land managers and researchers
   is developing grazing strategies that also maintain and enhance local
   and regional biodiversity. However, few studies have assessed the
   compatibility of management practices for maintaining long-term
   productivity and biodiversity conservation. We still have only a very
   basic understanding of the effects of different grazing strategies and
   pasture management on biodiversity and this is a major impediment to the
   development of appropriate and compatible best management practice. We
   argue that although there is an increasing desire to find management
   strategies that protect and enhance biodiversity without hindering
   long-term agricultural production, in many cases this may not be
   possible. Current knowledge suggests that compatibility is most likely
   to be achieved using low-input systems in low productivity ( fragile)
   landscapes, whereas in highly productive ( robust) landscapes there is
   less opportunity for integration of productive land-use and biodiversity
   conservation. There is an urgent need for improved communication and
   collaboration between agronomic and ecological researchers and research
   agencies to ensure that future programs consider sustainability in terms
   of biodiversity as well as pasture and livestock productivity and soil
   and water health.}},

Abstract = {{Exclosure plots were used to determine the effect of fire and grazing on
   the structure of a grassy-woodland community. Eighteen months after fire
   and fence treatments were applied, the species richness, cover and
   composition of shrubs, trees, herbs and grasses were assessed and
   compared to pre-treatment censuses. Unburned plots had fewer shrub
   species and a lower abundance of shrubs, indicating the importance of
   fire in promoting regeneration of shrub species. Eucalypt species were
   more abundant and richer following the wildfire burn in summer,
   suggesting timing of fires is an important aspect in the establishment
   of the canopy species. Interactions between fire and grazing were found
   for the abundance of eucalypts ( although weak) and resprouting
   eucalypts, suggesting a subtle interaction between fire and grazing
   shortly after fire. There was no effect of grazing and no interaction
   effect between fire and grazing on shrub species richness and abundance
   or tree species richness and seedling abundance.
   All plots showed a change in species composition despite treatment, and
   46 species ( 32\% of total richness) were recorded only in the final
   survey. The high rainfall during the 18-month study is likely to be an
   important factor in facilitating the establishment of species following
   all disturbances. This may have ameliorated the impact of grazing as
   abundant food was available throughout the woodland. The interaction
   between fire and grazing may be more important in structuring these
   grassy communities during periods of lower rainfall.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{529-542}},
Abstract = {{Most remnants of lowland grassland and grassy woodland in Tasmania are
   grazed by sheep. In some instances, grazed remnants have high
   conservation value, indicating that grazing and biodiversity
   conservation are not necessarily conflicting management goals. However,
   few data exist on the management practices most conducive to maintaining
   conservation values. The present study examined native grassland and
   grassy woodland subject to seven different sheep-grazing regimes in the
   Northern Midlands bioregion of Tasmania and sought to identify the
   effects of management and environmental factors on vegetation structure
   and composition. Structural and compositional differences between
   grassland and woodland, and herbivore scat counts, suggested that
   grazing disturbance was more intense in grassland than in woodland.
   Floristic differences within the vegetation appeared to be related to
   differences in grazing regime. Occurrence of species not commonly
   observed in grassy vegetation was associated with the resting of
   pastures in spring, while more intensely grazed sites contained
   assemblages of species typical of disturbed areas. Exotic invasion was
   greatest at sites that were not rested and/or had higher stocking rates,
   and at more eroded sites. Thus, resting and/or low stocking rates were
   associated with good condition in the grassland and grassy woodland. The
   nature of differences in vegetation attributes between woodland and
   grassland suggests that grazer habitat preference increases the
   differences between these vegetation types. Relatively minor variation
   in grazing regime was found to have resulted in distinct floristic
   outcomes, suggesting that the maintenance of a range of management
   regimes may be conducive to the maintenance of plant species diversity
   at a landscape scale.}},

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{597-608}},
Abstract = {{Few temporal studies document vegetation change in Australian temperate
   grassy woodlands. Floristic and structural data were collected from 68
   randomly located sites in the Queens Domain, an urban grassy woodland
   remnant, in 1974, 1984, 1994 and 2000 and a search made for rare
   species. Species of conservation significance were concentrated at
   highly disturbed sites, whereas vegetation types of conservation
   significance decreased in area as a result of increases in the numbers
   of Allocasuarina verticillata, which caused a change in many unmown
   areas from Eucalyptus viminalis grassy woodland to E. viminalis - A.
   verticillata woodland/ forest or A. verticillata open/ closed forest.
   Structural changes were associated with changes in species composition
   and an increase in native- species richness. Increases in tree cover
   occurred where fires were most frequent, possibly as a result of the
   lack of mammalian herbivores. The frequencies of herbs and annual
   grasses were strongly affected by precipitation in the month of
   sampling. Half of the species that showed a consistent rise or fall
   through time were woody plants, approximately twice the number expected.
   In the dataset as a whole, species- richness variables were largely
   explained by varying combinations of variables related to moisture
   availability, altitude and the incidence of mowing. The strongest
   influences on species composition were the same, although slope and time
   since the last. re also contributed to multiple regression and
   generalised linear models. Compositional stability was positively
   related to native- species richness, whereas high levels of exotic-
   species richness occurred at both low and high levels of native- species
   richness. The maintenance of native- plant biodiversity on the Domain
   requires such counterintuitive measures as the maintenance of exotic
   trees and the control of native trees, demonstrating the contingencies
   of conservation management in fragmented vegetation that consists of a
   mixture of native and exotic species.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of a new experiment, set up in Jena in spring 2002, are the
   effects of biodiversity on element cycles and the interaction of plant
   diversity with herbivores and soil fauna. The experimental design
   explicitly addresses criticisms provoked by previous biodiversity
   experiments. In particular, the choice of functional groups, the
   statistical separation of sampling versus complementarity effects, and
   testing for the effects of particular functional groups differ from
   previous experiments. Based on a species pool of 60 plant species common
   to the Central European Arrhenatherion grasslands, mixtures of one to 16
   (60) species and of one to four plant functional groups were established
   on 90 plots (20 in x 20 m) with nested experiments. In order to test
   specific hypotheses 390 additional small-area plots (3.5 m x 3.5 m) were
   set-up. Exact replicates of all species mixtures serve to assess the
   variability in ecosystem responses. In a dominance experiment, the
   effects of interactions among nine selected highly productive species
   are studied. Each species is grown as monoculture replicated once.}},

Pages = {{367-377}},
Abstract = {{The biodiversity of insects within urban areas has been relatively
   little studied. Given the large and ever increasing extent of urban
   areas, and that the insect species richness there can be high, it is
   important to know the factors determining that aspect of biodiversity.
   In this study two of these factors, namely habitat management and area,
   were considered. Arboreal and grassland Hemiptera, and grassland plants,
   were sampled on 18 roundabouts and other road enclosed sites in the town
   of Bracknell. Hemiptera were sampled using suction sampling and tree
   beating. A significant species-area relationship was found for arboreal
   Hemiptera, which was strongly related to habitat diversity. For both
   grassland plants and Hemiptera, grassland management, by mowing, had a
   significant effect on species richness. Despite the management grassland
   plants showed a significant species-area relationship. However the
   effect of management on Hemiptera was great enough to outweigh any area
   effect. As the size of open spaces is often constrained in urban areas,
   altering habitat management has a greater potential. for enhancing
   biodiversity. For arboreal Hemiptera choice of trees for planting is of
   particular importance, white for grassland Hemiptera diversity would be
   increased with a reduction in the intensity of management, such a
   reduction in the frequency of mowing. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{543-550}},
Abstract = {{Studies have shown that weed invasion into grasslands may be suppressed
   if the resident plant community is sufficiently diverse. The objective
   of this study was to determine whether increased forage plant diversity
   in grazed pasture communities might be associated with reduced weed
   abundance both in the aboveground vegetation and soil seed bank. Data
   were collected from a pasture experiment established in 1994 in
   Missouri, USA. The experiment consisted of 15 m x 15 m plots sown with
   Festuca arundinacea Schreb. or Bromus inermis Leysser as a base species
   in mixtures of 1, 2, 3, 6, or 8 forage species. The plots were grazed by
   cattle during each growing season from 1998 to 2002. Aboveground plant
   species composition in each plot was measured using a point step method.
   Soil cores were collected in 1999 and 2002, and the species composition
   of germinable weed seeds in plots were evaluated by identifying
   seedlings as they germinated over an 8-week period. Species diversity
   was measured using several indices: species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener
   diversity index (H'), and forage species evenness (J). Aboveground weed
   abundance in plots was unrelated to forage species richness (S), but
   weed abundance declined as the evenness (J) of resident forage species
   increased in mixtures. The species composition of mixtures may have
   affected weed abundance. Weeds both in the soil seed bank and
   aboveground vegetation were less abundant in mixtures that contained F.
   arundinacea compared with mixtures that contained B. inermis. Although
   variables like forage plant productivity may also suppress weed
   abundance in pastures, our resuits suggest that maintaining an evenly
   distributed mixture of forage species may help suppress weeds as well.

Abstract = {{Historical studies were made of the changing land use (260-1995) of 14
   calcareous hillsides in Upper-Normandy to investigate botanical changes
   over the last 200 years. Before the French Revolution in 1789, most of
   these hillsides were used as vineyards mixed with common sheep walks.
   After the French Revolution, they were distributed among inhabitants for
   cultivation (cereals) but they were abandoned in the nineteenth century
   and grazed again. Our results show that this history is correlated with
   important changes in the floristic composition of the calcareous
   hillsides between 1816 and 1995. The species richness of arable weeds
   and fallow-land species of former cultivated fields or vineyards
   decrease faster than that of chalk grassland species. The consequences
   of these long-term dynamics are discussed with regards to the ecological
   requirements and the rarity status of the species that have disappeared
   since 1935. We conclude with the need to take account of land use change
   processes, e.g. the alternation of arable fields and grasslands, to
   maintain the present species-richness of calcareous hillsides. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{The diversity patterns, the ecological structure and the typical species
   of the orthopteran assemblage in the Dadia reserve are investigated. The
   reserve was designed to protect the black vulture (Aegypius monachus)
   and other raptors. A total of 39 orthopteran species were found,
   including Paranocarodes chopardi, a pamphagid species with very
   restricted distribution. All species can be represented in a network of
   six complementary habitats, including open oak woodlands, agricultural
   fields separated with hedges, humid grasslands, as well as serpentine
   grasslands. The buffer zone of the reserve is far more important for
   Orthoptera conservation than the core areas, which host most of the
   black vulture nests. Management focusing on raptors is in general
   compatible with conservation of Orthoptera. We suggest the maintenance
   of forest openings in the buffer zone, the maintenance of forest
   heterogeneity, the enhancement of periodical livestock grazing, and the
   use of nine indicator species and Paranocarodes chopardi in the reserve
   monitoring program. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{483-493}},
Abstract = {{Researchers studying invasive plants often concentrate their efforts on
   predictive models thought to callow invasive plants to dominate native
   landscapes. However, if an invasive is already well established then
   experimental research is necessary to provide the information necessary
   to effectively manage the species. Prescribing appropriate management
   strategies without prior experimental research may not only be
   ineffective but also may squander limited resources or have the
   unintended consequence of furthering spread. Lespedeza cuneata (Dum.
   Cours.) G. Don. is a well-established invasive plant of old fields and
   tall-grass prairie in the US. Managers suspect this species shades-out
   native plants and this is proposed as its primary mechanism for
   dominance. Using field experiments we tested probable factors allowing
   the species to establish itself and, once established, interfere in old
   field plant communities. We also examined the effects of two common
   anthropogenic disturbances (mowing and nutrients) on L. cuneata growth
   and establishment. When L. cuneata was treated (clipping, herbicide and
   stem pull-back) there was a significant increase in species richness and
   native species cover. Stem density and canopy cover of L. cuneata
   increased significantly with mowing frequency but-decreased with
   nutrient input. We suggest that mowing benefits L. cuneata while also
   hindering woody competition. Results also indicate L. cuneata is less
   prevalent on nutrient enriched soils than on unamended soil. Lespedeza
   cuneata appears to suppress native plants by shading them out and it can
   subsequently take over grassland communities. Since it has a varying
   response to human induced disturbances and may actually benefit from
   mowing, land managers should be cautious when utilizing this as a
   management tool.}},

   Eastern Norway. In addition, AM colonization, spore numbers, and
   mycorrhizal inoculum potential was studied during one season. A
   split-plot design was used, with grazing as the main treatment and the
   application of benomyl as a subtreatment. AM colonization was
   significantly reduced because of benomyl application, whereas spore
   numbers were not significantly affected by the treatment. Mycorrhizal
   inoculum potential was reduced, but not consistently. In both sites
   nitrogen and phosphorus concentration of grass tissue was significantly
   higher in grazed plots than in ungrazed ones, and significantly lower in
   benomyl subplots than in controls. Plant diversity, composition, and
   cover had changed significantly after 4 years in grazed controls in
   Storvordlia, but this was not seen in Kalvsvangen. In both sites, total

Abstract = {{Recent studies have expanded research on biodiversity by investigating

   relationships between diversity and two ecosystem properties:
   productivity and invasibility. We develop a graphical model that
   predicts endophyte infection of a grass host will weaken correlations
   between diversity and ecosystem properties. We then use a long-term
   field experiment to test this prediction by manipulating symbiosis in
   tall fescue grass (Festuca arundinacea), a common and invasive species
   in the US. As predicted, endophyte infection reduced the strength of
   correlations between diversity and both primary productivity and the
   invasiveness of tall fescue. By altering relationships between diversity
   and ecosystem functioning, endophytic fungi may contribute more to the
   dynamics of communities than previously supposed.}},

Journal = {{FLORA}},

Volume = {{199}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{25-35}},
Abstract = {{The study deals with the influence of land use and abandonment on
   species composition of vegetation and seed bank in grasslands and
   oldfields. We wanted to explore:
   (1) How the seed bank changes when agricultural practices cease? In
   convergence with proposals in the literature, we addressed in particular
   the following two questions that have been proposed by Symonides (1986),
   Pickett \& McDonnell (1989) and Roberts \& Vankat (1991) for seed bank
   characteristics under secondary succession: (i) Does species richness
   and species diversity in the soil seed bank decrease during succession?
   (ii) Does the density of buried seed decline during succession?
   (2) What is the role played by seed bank in the recolonisation of plots
   disturbed by experimental disturbances ?
   We studied species composition of vegetation and seed bank in an
   experiment with grassland and oldfield plots in old embanked marshlands
   (called ``Marais Poitevin{''}). In these wetlands, artificial
   disturbances (mowing) and natural disturbances (cattle, roebucks,
   coypus, voles) are very frequent. In order to mimic disturbances,
   experimental disturbances were generated in spring after the end of the
   winter flooding and emerged seedlings counted three months later. Data
   about the seed bank, the undisturbed vegetation and seedlings emerging
   in disturbed quadrats were sampled. Detrended Correspondence Analysis
   (DCA) of the undisturbed quadrats, disturbed quadrats and seed bank
   samples showed significant differences of species composition.
   Similarity between seed bank and undisturbed aboveground vegetation was
   low and not very different between grassland and oldfield. Very few
   seedlings emerged in the undisturbed vegetation both in grassland and
   oldfield, which potentially indicates the importance of gaps for seed
   bank expression. In Marais Poitevin, the seed bank contributed very
   little to the seedling flora, and vegetative regrowth clearly
   predominated recolonisation after disturbances. In the seed bank, few
   species lost after succession from grassland to oldfield vegetation were
   still present as seeds in the soil, but in most cases species lost were
   not recorded in the seed bank. The results have shown that species
   richness and species diversity in the seed bank decrease during
   succession. On the other hand, the density of buried seeds did not
   decrease significantly from grassland to oldfield.}},

Abstract = {{The hump-shaped relationship between plant species richness and biomass
   is commonly observed at fine scale for herbaceous vegetation in
   temperate climates. This relationship predicts that herbaceous species
   richness is highest at an intermediate level of biomass that corresponds
   to moderate competition or disturbance. However, this relationship has
   not previously been investigated in high and sub-alpine mountain
   grasslands. We tested the humped-back prediction in the and
   Trans-Himalayan mountain grassland with a seasonal grazing system. The
   study area is located in the bottom of a U-shaped valley, in the Manang
   district (3500 m.a.s.l.). We sampled two hundred plots (I in X I m) in
   two different types of pastures: common pasture and old field, which
   both have similar grazing practices. There was a significant unimodal
   relationship between species richness and biomass only in the common
   pasture, and when the two sites were analyzed together. The species
   turnover is estimated by DCA in standard deviation unit. The turnover
   was lower in the old field than in the common pasture. The unimodal
   relationship between plant species richness and biomass did not
   disappear after accounting for unknown environmental gradients expressed

   The species richness is highest at 120 +/- 40 g/m(2). The results

Volume = {{57}},

Abstract = {{A 6-year study was conducted in tallgrass prairie to assess the effects
   of grazing management (cattle stocking densities and grazing systems) on
   plant community composition and diversity. Treatments included sites
   grazed season-long (May to October) at 3 stocking densities (3.8, 2.8,
   and 1.8 hectares per animal unit), ungrazed control sites, and sites
   under a late-season rest rotation grazing system at this same range of
   stocking densities. Plant communities were sampled twice each season
   using a nearest-point procedure. Native plant species diversity, species
   richness, and growth form diversity were significantly higher in grazed
   compared to ungrazed prairie, and diversity was greatest at the highest
   stocking density. This enhancement of plant species diversity under
   grazing was not a result of increased frequency of weedy/exotic species.
   There were no significant effects of grazing system on plant diversity,
   nor any significant stocking density x grazing system interactions,
   indicating that animal density is a key management variable influencing
   plant species diversity and composition in tallgrass prairie and that
   effects of animal density override effects of grazing systems.
   Increasing cattle stocking densities decreased the abundance of the
   dominant perennial tall grasses, and increased abundance of the C-4
   perennial mid-grasses. The frequency of perennial forbs was relatively
   stable across grazing treatments. Abundance of annual forbs varied among
   years and grazing treatments. In half of the years sampled, annual forbs
   showed the highest frequency under intermediate stocking density.
   Patterns of responses among plant groups suggest that some species may
   respond principally to direct effects of grazers and others may respond
   to indirect effects of grazers on competitive relationships or on the
   spatial patterns of fuel loads and fires. Thus, this study suggests that
   large grazer densities, fire, and annual climatic variability interact
   to influence patterns of plant community composition and diversity in
   tallgrass prairie. Effects of varying management such as stocking
   densities and grazing systems on plant species diversity and the
   relative abundances of different plant growth forms or functional groups
   may have important consequences for grassland community stability and
   ecosystem function.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the effects of insect herbivory on a plant community of
   a productive old-field community by applying foliar and soil
   insecticides in a full factorial design. During the first 3 years of
   succession, insecticide treatments had only minor effects on total cover
   abundance and species richness. However, species ranking within the
   plant community was strongly affected by soil insecticide but not by
   foliar insecticide. Creeping thistle, Cirsium arvense , dominated the
   experimental plots with reduced root herbivory, while square-stemmed
   willow-herb, Epilobium adnatum , dominated the control and the plots
   with foliar insecticide. When soil insecticide was applied, cover
   abundance of monocarpic forbs increased and cover abundance of
   polycarpic herbs decreased compared to the control. However, this effect
   was due to a few abundant plant species and is not based on a consistent
   difference between life history groups. Instead, application of soil
   insecticide promoted persistence of species that established at the
   start of succession, and suppressed species that established in the
   following years. We conclude that below-ground herbivory reduces
   competitive ability of resident species and, thus, facilitates
   colonization by late-successional species. Hence, soil insects can exert
   strong top-down effects on the vegetation of productive sites by
   affecting dominant plant species and altering competitive balances.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation is a common feature of modern landscapes, with
   significant impacts on the population densities of and space use by
   animals. A frequent model system for studying these effects is that of
   voles (Microtus spp.) and other rodents in experimentally fragmented
   grasslands. Design of these study sites is motivated by landscape
   theory, and often assumes that the matrix between discrete experimental
   habitat patches is inhospitable to focal species. Our census of M.
   ochrogaster runways in an experimentally fragmented landscape in eastern
   Kansas indicates that voles make substantial use of the mowed matrix,
   and that such use increases with degree of habitat fragmentation. Census
   season (winter, summer) was also an important predictor of observed
   runway distributions. Our results suggest that voles may have home
   ranges that include multiple small fragments and also the intervening
   matrix, leading to overestimates of population density. While the
   assumption that the matrix is inhospitable in experimentally fragmented
   habitats may be justified in many cases, studies using the model system
   of Microtus spp. or ecologically similar rodents in grasslands should
   incorporate methods that account for use of the matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Quantitative analyses of the snail assemblages of four a priori defined
   categories of grassland sites, characterized by soil moisture, land use
   and management, were conducted in SW Germany. Topsoil pH and calcium
   content were determined for each of 39 sites. The objectives were to
   study the effects of these habitat characteristics on snail density,
   species richness and quantitative structure of the land snail
   assemblages. With one exception, no significant relationships between
   soil pH (as a proxy for Ca supply) and the total numbers of individuals
   and species at the four site categories were observed. Snail density and
   species richness on groundwater soils, represented by rarely mown sedge
   stands and regularly mown meadows, were clearly higher than on
   intermediate moisture soils (as defined by the climatic water balance)
   of regularly mown meadows, indicating that soil moisture was the most
   important factor accounting for these differences. Furthermore, we
   observed specific conditions associated with the presence of trees in
   the category of meadow orchards on intermediate moisture soils. There,
   numbers of individuals and species were significantly higher than in the
   meadows on intermediate moisture soils. A posteriori cluster analysis of
   quantitative similarity of all snail assemblages showed that soil
   moisture accounts for the major differences between the site categories
   with respect to snail density, species richness and quantitative
   composition of the grassland snail assemblages. As these results are in
   contrast to the findings of many woodland studies, we suggest that the
   occurrence or abundance of certain species in the site categories are
   explained by land management, especially by frequent disturbances at the
   soil surface caused by mowing. (C) 2004 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{175}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{217-226}},
Abstract = {{The effects of cattle grazing on plant species trait groups were studied
   by comparing three kinds of mesic semi-natural grasslands in southern
   Finland: old (continuously cattle grazed), new (cattle grazing restarted
   3-8 years ago) and abandoned pastures (grazing terminated > 10 years
   ago). Two spatial scales were studied: 1 m(2) and grassland patch
   (0.25-0.8 ha). Species richness was higher among most species trait
   groups in old than in abandoned pastures and showed some recovery in new
   pastures. More pronounced differences were found per m(2) than per
   grassland patch. Richness of perennial and biennial plants was in order
   old > new > abandoned pastures both per m(2) and per grassland patch,
   but richness of annual plants was significantly higher only per
   grassland patch. Grazing increased the richness of hemicryptophytes and
   chamaephytes and decreased that of geophytes both per m(2) and per
   grassland patch. Richness of small and medium-sized plants was higher in
   grazed than in abandoned grasslands. Only richness of the tallest
   species (height > 80 cm) was lower in grazed grasslands. The proportion
   of species trait groups, in which species richness was higher in grazed
   than in abandoned grasslands, was higher than in previous studies. This
   may be due largely to the differences in the grassland type (mesic vs.
   dry or wet). It is proposed that species trait responses to grazing may
   be related to how effectively natural factors (e.g., drought, flooding)
   limit plant growth. In mesic grasslands natural factors limit plant
   growth less than in dry or wet grasslands. Because of this the number of
   groups of species with different species traits benefitting from grazing
   is higher in mesic than in dry or wet areas.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this experiment was to determine how increasing species
   richness within artificially created grassland gaps affected the overall
   magnitude of seedling losses to, and the selectivity of, seedling
   herbivores. Using chemical exclusion methods, the influence of molluscs
   the principal invertebrate herbivores in temperate grasslands, was
   assessed at three levels of plant species diversity ( 3, 6, and 12
   species per gap). In comparison with ungrazed controls, mollusc
   herbivory significantly reduced seedling numbers. However, the total
   number of seedlings killed by molluscs was unrelated to the number of
   seedling species present in the gap. Furthermore, there was no evidence
   to suggest that seedling species diversity influenced rates of mollusc
   selection of the three individual species (Agrostis capillaris, Senecio
   jacobaeae, and Taraxacum officinale) present in each diversity
   treatment. This work highlights the preferential selection by molluscs
   of broad-leaved herb species over neighbouring grass seedlings. However

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2004}},
Volume = {{170}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{203-222}},
Abstract = {{This paper discusses vegetation types and diversity patterns in relation
   to environment and land-use at summer farms, a characteristic cultural
   landscape in the Norwegian mountains. Floristic data (189 taxa) were
   collected in 130 4-m(2) sample plots within 12 summer farms in Roldal,
   western Norway. The study was designed to sample as fully as possible
   the range of floristic, environmental, and land-use conditions.
   Vegetation types delimited by two-way indicator species analysis were
   consistent with results from earlier phytosociological studies.
   Detrended correspondence analysis and canonical correspondence analysis
   show that rather than being distinct vegetation types, the major
   floristic variation is structured along a spatial gradient from summer
   farm to the surrounding heathland vegetation. Species richness (alpha
   diversity) was modelled against environmental variables by generalized
   linear modelling and compositional turnover (beta diversity) by
   canonical correspondence analysis. Most environmental factors made
   significant contributions, but the spatial distance-to-farm gradient was
   the best predictor of both species richness and turnover. While summer
   farms reduce mean species richness at the plot scale, the compositional
   heterogeneity of the upland landscapes is increased, thereby creating
   `ecological room' for additional vegetation types and species. Within an
   overall similarity across scales, soil variables (pH, base saturation,
   LOI, phosphate and nitrogen) differed considerably in their explanatory
   power for richness and turnover. A difference between `productivity
   limiting' factors and `environmental sieves' is proposed as an
   explanation. Species turnover with altitude is relatively low in
   grasslands as compared to heaths.}},

Abstract = {{In the Simpson Desert of western Queensland fire is being used

   month) effects of cattle grazing on hummock grasslands regenerating
   after fire in the Simpson Desert. Dung counts were used to determine if
   cattle grazed preferentially in areas regenerating after fire. Cattle
   exclosures and vegetation surveys were used to determine if grazing by
   cattle affected the structure and species composition of vegetation
   regenerating after fire.
   Cattle grazed preferentially in areas regenerating after fire. Cattle
   grazing reduced the cover, height, vertical density and species richness
   of regrowth vegetation. Grazing reduced the cover of Ptilotus
   polystachyus and reduced the proportion of Eragrostis eriopodia
   individuals bearing flowers and seed. Grazing visibly disrupted
   microbiotic soil crusts. It is recommended, as a precaution until
   additional data is available, that areas regenerating after fire be
   rested from grazing during the first post-fire wet season. Resting
   during this period will assist the establishment of vegetation cover and

   modelling was used to examine which environmental factors best explained
   the species' abundance, and ground cover was a consistent predictor
   across the two study areas. Despite occurring in sites mechanically
   cleared of trees, P. desertor was more abundant in those pastures with a
   high cover of native hummock grasses. Though superficially indicating a
   degree of tolerance of disturbance, the evidence suggests that P.

Abstract = {{This paper incorporates the indigenous ecological knowledge (IEK) of the
   Maasai pastoralists and ecological methods to assess effects of grazing
   and cropping on rangeland biodiversity at macro- and micro-landscape
   scales in northern Tanzania. The joint surveys with pastoralists
   identified indicator plant species and their associations with
   micro-landscapes and livestock grazing suitability (i.e. for cattle and
   small ruminant grazing), while traditional calf-pasture reserves
   (alalili pl. alalilia) were evaluated for preservation of rangeland
   biodiversity. The macro-landscapes comprising the cool high plateau
   (osupuko pl. isipuki) and montane forest highland (endim) were included
   in the survey. At micro-landscape scales, the osupuko was classified
   into uplands (orkung'u), slopes (andamata) and dry valley bottomlands
   (ayarata). The micro-landscapes were assessed in terms of herbaceous
   plant species and woody species richness and risks of soil erosion.
   Biodiversity varied at both the macro- and micro-landscape scales and in
   accordance with the land-use types. Greater plant species diversity and
   less erosion risks were found in the pastoral landscapes than in the
   agro-pastoral landscapes. The calf-grazing pastures had greater
   herbaceous species richness than the non-calf pastures, which in turn
   had more woody species. The study concludes that the indigenous systems
   of landscape classification provides a valuable basis for assessing
   rangeland biodiversity, which ecologists should incorporate into
   ecological surveys of the rangelands in East Africa in the future.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in forage systems taking into account new environmental issues
   often lead to a reappraisal of the agricultural practices by farmers.
   These changes also raise new issues about the relevancy of traditional
   practices of grassland management. We therefore propose an analytical
   scheme to describe a production plan compatible with land resources (
   sown or native grasslands). To that end, we present a conceptual model
   that can be used to design a set of grazing management practices suited
   to a diversity of specifications. It involves a combination of
   defoliation and fertiliser practices, allowing different targets to be
   achieved in terms of herbage yield, composition and grassland
   biodiversity. Finally, we suggest several management principles
   underlying these changes in forage systems. These management principles
   allow the taking of decisions on a monthly to yearly basis, to assess
   the conformity between farm resources and farmers' objectives, and to
   coordinate different combinations of herd and land at different periods
   of the year.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural landscapes are essential for preserving biodiversity, even
   though agricultural activities are the leading cause of habitat
   degradation worldwide. About half of the Earth's productive land area is
   farmed or grazed, whereas only about 6\% of the total land area is
   protected for native species and ecosystems. The ecological services of
   healthy ecosystems are fundamental to agriculture, and these services
   depend upon a large number of species interacting with each other and
   with inorganic nutrient cycles. Likewise, the quality of ecosystems
   between reserves is critical to the persistence of species and
   ecological processes within reserves. Thus, conservation-oriented
   farming methods are critically important for both agriculture and
   biodiversity. Three examples illustrate agricultural practices that
   benefit the farmers, the local ecosystem and the landscape: (1) In
   Minnesota, rotational grazing, evaluated by the collaborative research
   of farmers and scientists, improved soil, pasture and stream quality,
   and boosted the confidence of the farmers in developing more sustainable
   grazing practices. (2) Predator-friendly ranching in Montana, in which
   nonlethal methods are used to protect livestock from depredation by
   native predators, benefited the ranchers with premium prices for wool
   and meat. The persistence of native predators, many of which have been
   on endangered species lists for years, benefited the regional ecosystem.
   (3) Shade-grown coffee in Latin America, in which coffee shrubs grow
   under an intact forest canopy, often looks and behaves ecologically like
   native forest and may house high levels of native biodiversity. This
   system benefited farmers, as long as they received a price premium for
   shade-grown coffee. The economic viability of these
   conservation-oriented practices depends upon farmers receiving price
   premiums for their products and by society rewarding farmers for their
   practices. A vision of ecological farming as the dominant form of
   agriculture is presented, with benefits at the scale of the farm, the
   landscape and society.}},

Abstract = {{In previous studies, limited dispersal was revealed to be the main
   obstacle to restoration of species-rich flood-meadows along the northern
   Upper Rhine in Germany. To overcome dispersal limitation we transferred
   freshly mown plant material from species-rich sources to a restoration
   site on a former arable field. Before plant material application,
   topsoil was removed to accelerate nutrient impoverishment and create
   favourable conditions for seedling recruitment.
   Topsoil removal led to a drastic reduction in organic matter and
   essential mineral nutrients to the level of target communities (P) or
   even below (N, K). At a removal depth of 30 cm content of the soil seed
   bank that comprised exclusively of annual arable weeds, ruderals and
   some common grassland species, declined by 60 - 80\%, while at a removal
   depth of 50 cm the seed bank was almost completely eliminated. With few
   exceptions, all species recorded in source plant material were found
   established at the restoration site. However, the overall correlation
   between seed content in plant material and establishment success was not
   very high.
   Vegetation development at the restoration site was characterized by a
   rapid decline in arable weeds and ruderals, while resident grassland
   species and species transferred with plant material increased rapidly
   from the third year onwards. After four years as many as 102 species
   were established that could be exclusively attributed to plant material
   transfer, among them many rare and highly endangered plants.
   Establishment of species from plant material was most successful in
   regularly flooded plots, due to the suppression of competitors as well
   as the creation of favourable moisture conditions for seedling
   emergence.
   Diaspore transfer with plant material proved to be an extremely
   successful method in restoring species-rich grassland. However, high
   quality of plant material and suitable site conditions with low
   competition in early stages of succession seem to be essential
   prerequisites.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary succession and seed bank formation was studied in a formerly
   grazed, abandoned, eastern Hungarian sandy steppe-meadow
   (Pulsatillo-Festucetum). The vegetation was sampled at different
   elevations of a sand dune which became partly invaded by the tree
   Robinia pseudo-acacia ca. 10 yr ago. Pre-abandonment vegetation records
   were used as historic references. Though composition of the non-invaded
   grassland only changed moderately, dominance of tall grasses (Elymus
   hispidus, Poa angustifolia) increased significantly at the cost of
   annuals and low stature perennials. In the stand invaded by Robinia most
   grassland species were lost and replaced by nitrophytes. Vertical
   position influenced species abundance, but affected the composition only
   moderately. Fine-scale zonation of the vegetation also changed with
   time. Species richness of the above-ground vegetation and the seed
   density of soil samples at the lower elevation were slightly greater
   than at the higher sites.
   Seed banks of sensitive grassland specialists (e.g. Pulsatilla pratensis
   subsp. hungarica) disappeared during grass encroachment. Following
   extinction from above-ground vegetation, restoration must rely on
   dispersal from adjacent areas. In contrast, several annuals and
   perennials, which survived this degradation stage in the above-ground
   vegetation, possessed seed banks. Many of these species became extinct
   from the vegetation during the Robinia invasion but left viable
   persistent seeds. This fact is promising for restoration of the
   Potentillo-Festucetum sandy pasture. Competitive weedy species and
   sprouting Robinia can, however, limit seedling establishment.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of cattle grazing on the vegetation of calcareous fens was
   compared to the effects of traditional autumn mowing in southern
   Germany. Vegetation composition was studied in adjacent pairs of fen
   meadows and pastures with similar environmental conditions and biomass
   production. Vegetation data were analysed with respect to species
   richness, species composition and response of species traits to
   disturbance, including morphology, defence mechanisms, clonal growth
   form and generative reproduction. Species richness was significantly
   reduced by grazing, but the percentage of typical fen species or Red
   Data Book species was not affected by land use type. Detrended
   Corrspondence Analysis indicated that species composition could best be
   explained in terms of a land use gradient. Species traits showed a clear
   trend in their response to land use type. Grazing favoured grasses and
   small forbs. Only a few species with defence mechanisms against foraging
   were more frequent or abundant on pastures. Many other species with
   defence mechanisms, however, did not have an advantage on pastures.
   Flowering and seed dispersal traits did not respond significantly to
   grazing or mowing. Species with fast spreading stem derived clonal
   organs were favoured on pastures, whereas all other clonal growth forms
   and, particularly, non-clonal species were more abundant on meadows.
   More indicator species of wet soil conditions and species adapted to
   flooding were found on pastures. Grazing can be recommended as an
   alternative land use to mowing in contrast to abandonment, but a
   reduction in species richness and changes in species composition and
   species traits may occur.}},

Abstract = {{Thirty-one meadows were investigated within five sites representing
   various farming styles found in Austrian cultural landscapes. The
   meadows were analysed regarding (a) biodiversity (vascular plant and
   bryophyte species richness), (b) land-use practices (fertiliser input,
   mowing intensity, the use of silage), and (c) economic aspects (variable
   costs, profit margin and subsidies per ha). There were significant
   negative correlations between plant species richness and mowing
   intensity and intensity of fertiliser application. Bryophytes were good
   indicators of low nutrient regimes, having high species richness at low
   fertiliser input. Vascular plants showed highest species richness at an
   intermediate nitrogen supply. The total plant species richness decreased
   with increasing nitrogen supply. Intensive silage production was also
   negatively correlated with plant diversity. Species with a very narrow
   ecological niche of soil moisture and nutrients declined, whereas
   species adapted to wider ecological conditions increased. Profit margin
   and variable costs correlated negatively with plant species richness,
   with meadows that offered low or no profit margins showing highest
   species richness. There was no significant relationship between species
   richness and the amount of subsidies invested at the study meadows.
   Estimated costs of maintaining a species are shown. It is concluded that
   if plant species richness are to be maintained in these meadows, farmers
   have to receive increased financial incentives through
   agro-environmental subsidies for appropriate meadow management, and
   these have to be linked to clearly defined measures. (C) 2003 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Traditionally, nature reserves have been centered mainly around areas
   that are important for vertebrate diversity. This practice has not gone
   unchallenged and may be a suboptimal choice for overall conservation
   planning. To investigate this problem, we sampled butterfly species
   richness in a nature reserve in north eastern Greece that was originally
   established for the protection of birds of prey. Patterns of butterfly
   species richness and abundance were investigated by means of transect
   walks across a range of the seven predominant habitat types (wet and dry
   meadow, pine, oak and mixed forest, grazed, and agricultural land). Data
   analysis, including ANOVA and DCA (detrended correspondence analysis),
   revealed that the main gradients in butterfly species richness (low to
   high) were from sites dominated by the pine forest matrix of the core
   areas of the reserve, to peripheral sites in landscapes of mixed or oak
   forest, and from sites with little human impact to more disturbed areas
   with high grazing pressure. Species of conservation interest were
   concentrated at sites of low human impact. Ten of them are endemic to
   Europe and/or threatened in Europe. In this respect, the most important
   species are Lycaena ottomanus, Thymelicus acteon, and Pseudophilotes
   vicrama which are declining all over Europe. Our results suggest that
   (1) traditional agricultural practices in areas surrounded by forest can
   be considered as important management tools in butterfly conservation,
   (2) highest butterfly species richness is found in the periphery of the

Abstract = {{Habitat managers use cattle grazing to reduce alien plant cover and
   promote native species in California grasslands and elsewhere in the
   western United States. We tested the effectiveness of grazing as a
   restoration method by examining the effects of herbivory on native and
   alien plants. At Carrizo Plain National Monument, California, we
   surveyed native and alien species cover in adjacent grazed and ungrazed
   areas. We also established experimental plots in which plants were
   clipped or mulch (dead biomass) was removed. In addition, we clipped
   plants grown in pots and plants in the field that grew with and without
   competitors. Native species were negatively affected by clipping in
   1999, 2000, and 2001, whereas alien species were unaffected. In the
   experimental field plots, the European annual forb Erodium cicutarium
   compensated in growth and reproduction following simulated herbivory. In
   contrast, growth and reproduction of the native perennial bunchgrass Poa
   secunda were reduced 1 year after clipping. In pots, E. cicutarium
   overcompensated and grasses undercompensated. In the field, European
   grasses were unaffected by the removal of competitors. It is unclear by
   what mechanism E. cicutarium was able to compensate, but the ability may
   be related to its basal rosette growth form and indeterminately growing
   inflorescences. The native California grassland community assembled in
   the absence of grazing herds, whereas invasive European species have
   been exposed to grazing for centuries. It may be that these invaders
   have adaptations that better enable them to recover from grazing. In the
   grassland we studied, the strategy of livestock grazing for restoration
   is counterproductive. It harms native species and promotes alien plant
   growth.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing represents a major human alteration of natural
   disturbance regimes in grasslands throughout the world, and its impacts
   on plant communities have been highly debated. We investigated the
   impact of cattle grazing on the California coastal prairie plant
   community with a focus on native annual forbs, a number of which are of
   conservation concern. In spring 2000 and 2001, we surveyed the
   vegetation community composition, vegetation structure, and soil
   chemical parameters at 25 paired grazed and ungrazed sites over a 670-km
   range of the ecosystem. Native annual forb species richness and cover
   were higher in grazed sites, and this effect was concomitant with
   decreased vegetation height and litter depth. Soil properties explained
   less of the variation. Exotic annual grass and forb cover were higher in
   grazed sites. Native grass cover and species richness did not differ in
   grazed and ungrazed sites, but cover and species richness of native
   perennial forbs were higher in ungrazed sites. Our results suggest that
   cattle grazing may be a valuable management tool with which to conserve
   native annual forbs in the ecosystem we studied but that grazing
   differentially affects the various life-history guilds. Therefore, land
   managers must focus on creating a matrix of disturbance regimes to
   maintain the suite of species native to these mesic grasslands. The
   results of this and other studies highlight the importance of
   considering the adaptation of vegetation communities to disturbance in
   making recommendations for grazing management.}},

Abstract = {{The future of mammalian diversity in the tropics depends largely on the
   conservation value of human-dominated lands. We investigated the
   distribution of non-flying mammals in five habitats of southern Costa
   Rica: relatively extensive forest (227 ha), coffee plantation, pasture,
   coffee with adjacent forest remnant (35 ha), and pasture with adjacent
   forest remnant (35 ha). Of the 26 native species recorded in our study
   plots, 9 (35\%) were restricted to forest habitat, 14 (54\%) occurred in
   both forest and agricultural habitats, and 3 (11\%) were found only in
   agricultural habitats. Species richness and composition varied
   significantly with habitat type but not with distance from the extensive
   forest. Interestingly, small forest remnants (35 ha) contiguous with
   coffee plantations did not differ from more extensive forest in species
   richness and were richer than other agricultural habitat types. Small
   remnants contiguous with pasture were species-poor. When clearing
   started, the study region likely supported about 60 species. Since then,
   at least 6 species (10\%), one family (4\%), and one order (11\%) have
   gone extinct locally. The species that disappeared were the largest in
   their families and included carnivorous (e. g., jaguar {[}Panthera
   onca]), herbivorous (e. g., Baird's tapir, {[}Tapirus bairdii]), and
   arboreal (e. g., mantled howler monkey {[}Alouatta palliata]) species.
   Although there is no substitute for native forest habitat, the majority
   of native, nonflying mammal species use countryside habitats. The
   populations of many persist even >5 km from relatively extensive forest,
   at least over the 40 years since forest clearance. Moreover, if hunting
   ceased, we expect that at least one of the locally extinct species could
   be reestablished in the existing landscape. Thus, there is an important
   opportunity to maintain and restore the diversity, abundance, and
   ecosystem roles of mammals in at least some human-dominated regions of
   the Neotropics.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The southern Iberian Peninsula is dominated by a savannah-like
   ecosystem, the montado, which is a typically Mediterranean cultural
   adaptation to generally poor productive areas. Montados are exploited
   for three main uses: forestry, agriculture, and extensive grazing, in
   proportions that vary according to local conditions (more or less
   productive land) and historical circumstances. Because these ecosystems
   occur over a large geographic area (they occupy some 6 million ha),
   biodiversity would be expected to vary among montados. However,
   differences in management practices may also influence species
   distribution. In this paper, we investigate differences in plant and
   bird species diversity among 60 montados distributed all across southern
   Portugal. The environmental variables studied included geographical
   coordinates, climatological data, soil type, and altitude. We also
   investigated agro-economic variables that could describe human
   activities at each site: animal husbandry (breeds, stock density,
   grazing rotation, etc.), agriculture (fallow rotation frequency, use of
   fertilizers, etc.), and forestry (cork harvesting, thinning, etc.).
   Finally, land-use type and metrics were assessed from rectified aerial
   photographs. Species richness among these two groups was not correlated,
   sites with high or low numbers of plant species not necessarily having
   high or low numbers of bird species. However, both plant and bird
   communities exhibited a similar pattern of species composition and
   turnover. This pattern was ecologically based, rather than a result of
   biological similarities between groups: direct gradient analyses and
   variance partitioning revealed strong correlations between species
   distribution and spatial gradients, namely longitude and latitude. In
   trying to distinguish anthropogenic from biophysical processes, we found
   that both were equally important as drivers of montado, biodiversity.
   Plants and birds exhibited a similar ecological pattern, although
   environmental conditions were slightly more important in the case of
   plants, and human activities were slightly more important in the case of
   birds.}},

   rhizospheric soil were collected from paired, Poa pratensis-dominated
   grassland plots located inside and outside a 40-year-old exclosure. P.
   pratensis aboveground, belowground, and whole plant growth were greater
   in pots with soil communities from grazed grassland compared to fenced
   grassland, indicating (1) soil microbial communities differed, and (2)
   this difference influenced the growth of the plant that dominated both
   grasslands. Treating pots with fungicide (benomyl) suppressed the soil
   community influence, indicating that different fungal communities caused
   the soil microbe effect. In addition, two lines of evidence are
   consistent with the hypothesis that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal (AMF)
   species composition affected P. pratensis: (1) a divergence in AMF spore
   communities in the two field soils, and (2) little evidence of

Abstract = {{The drastic loss of seminatural grasslands and the decrease in species

   changes to landscape fragmentation and species diversity. Our results
   show that the termination of grazing on seminatural grassland caused
   significant changes in landscape structure and a decline in the number
   of vascular plant species. The decline of grazed grasslands has been
   driven mainly by farm-level economic efficiency and profitability
   interests, which have been connected with agricultural policy measures.
   Since 1995, when Finland joined the European Union, the area of grazed

Abstract = {{Restoration of semi-natural grasslands by cattle grazing is among the
   most practical options for reversing the decline of northern European
   floristic diversity, but no studies on this subject are available. In
   this work the success of restoration of abandoned, privately owned mesic
   semi-natural grasslands by farmers receiving support from the EU
   agri-environmental support scheme was studied in southwestern Finland.
   Three kinds of grasslands were compared: old (continuously cattle
   grazed), new (cattle grazing restarted 3-8 years ago) and abandoned
   pastures (grazing terminated >10 years ago). Plant species composition
   of the three pasture types was floristically different in multivariate
   analyses (non-metric multidimensional scaling). Total species richness,
   richness of grassland plants, indicator plants and rare plants were
   highest in old and lowest in abandoned pastures in all studied spatial
   scales (0.25-0.8 ha, 1 and 0.01 m(2)). The results were congruent with
   different scales and species list definitions, suggesting that species
   density scale (1 m(2)) can be used as a partial surrogate for large
   scale species richness. Species richness of new pastures was 20\% higher
   on 0.25-0.8 ha, 40-50\% higher on 1 m(2) and 30\% higher on the 0.01
   m(2) scale compared to abandoned grasslands. Rare species showed
   insignificant response to resumed grazing. Despite problems in
   management quality, this study showed promising results of restoration
   of abandoned grasslands by cattle grazing on private farms. However,
   populations of several rare grassland plants may not recover with
   present cattle grazing regimes. Management regulations in the
   agri-environmental support scheme need to be defined more precisely for
   successful restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by large ungulates often increases plant species richness in
   grasslands of moderate to high productivity. In a mesic North American
   grassland with and without the presence of bison (Bos bison), a native
   ungulate grazer, three non-exclusive hypotheses for increased plant
   species richness in grazed grasslands were evaluated: (1) bison grazing
   enhances levels of resource (light and N) availability, enabling species
   that depend on higher resource availability to co-occur; (2) spatial
   heterogeneity in resource availability is enhanced by bison, enabling
   coexistence of a greater number of plant species; (3) increased species
   turnover (i.e. increased species colonization and establishment) in
   grazed grassland is associated with enhanced plant species richness. We
   measured availability and spatial heterogeneity in light, water and N,
   and calculated species turnover from long-term data in grazed and
   ungrazed sites in a North American tallgrass prairie. Both regression
   and path analyses were performed to evaluate the potential of the three
   hypothesized mechanisms to explain observed patterns of plant species
   richness under field conditions. Experimental grazing by bison increased
   plant species richness by 25\% over an 8-year period. Neither
   heterogeneity nor absolute levels of soil water or available N were
   related to patterns of species richness in grazed and ungrazed sites.
   However, high spatial heterogeneity in light and higher rates of species
   turnover were both strongly related to increases in plant species
   richness in grazed areas. This suggests that creation of a mosaic of
   patches with high and low biomass (the primary determinant of light
   availability in mesic grasslands) and promotion of a dynamic species
   pool are the most important mechanisms by which grazers affect species
   richness in high productivity grasslands.}},

   (Cevennes National Park, France) since their abandonment in the 1950's.
   Subsequently, late-suceessional beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) has
   progressively invaded the ageing pine stands. We studied 44 plots
   according to a gradient of forest colonization and maturation, from
   heathlands to mature beech stands. The objective was to assess the
   impact of forest colonization on the vegetation composition and richness
   of legally-protected grasslands and heathlands. Dendrometric
   characteristics and demography were assessed on each 20 x 20 in plot. An
   extensive around vegetation analysis was carried out, focusing on plant
   functional traits that may be sensitive to canopy closure. Results
   indicated the persistence of most heathland species under pure and young
   Scots pine stands, but quite high species turnover. Xerothermic and
   strictly shade-intolerant species rapidly disappeared, whereas
   thermophilic forest species were apparent. In submature and mature pine
   stands, the establishment of a beech understorey entailed considerable
   species turnover, and prevent pine regeneration. In pure beech stands,
   ruderal and stress-tolerators were replaced by shade-tolerant and
   competitive species. Ellenberg's scores for light, nutrients and water
   confirmed the changes in vegetation composition and plant life traits,
   whereas the Shannon diversity index remained quite constant among pure

Abstract = {{Ozone (O-3) phytototoxicity has been reported on a wide range of plant
   species, inducing the appearance of specific foliar injury or increasing
   leaf senescence. No information regarding the sensitivity of plant
   species from dehesa Mediterranean grasslands has been provided in spite
   of their great biological diversity. A screening study was carried out
   in open-top chambers (OTCs) to assess the O-3-sensitivity of 22
   representative therophytes of these ecosystems based on the appearance
   and extent of foliar injury. A distinction was made between specific O-3
   injury and non-specific discolorations. Three O-3 treatments
   (charcoal-filtered air, non-filtered air and non-filtered air
   supplemented with 40 nl l(-1) O-3 during 5 days per week) and three OTCs
   per treatment were used. The Papilionaceae species were more sensitive
   to O-3 than the Poaceae species involved in the experiment since ambient
   levels induced foliar symptoms in 67\% and 27\%, respectively, of both
   plant families. An O-3-sensitivity ranking of the species involved in
   the assessment is provided, which could be useful for bioindication
   programmes in Mediterranean areas. The assessed Trifolium species were
   particularly sensitive since foliar symptoms were apparent in
   association with O-3 accumulated exposures well below the current
   critical level for the prevention of this kind of effect. The exposure
   indices involving lower cut-off values (i.e. 30 nl l(-1)) were best
   related with the extent Of O-3-induced injury on these species. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Patterns of native and alien plant diversity in response to disturbance
   were examined along an elevational gradient in blue oak savanna,
   chaparral, and coniferous forests. Total species richness, alien species
   richness, and alien cover declined with elevation, at scales from 1 to
   1000 m(2). We found no support for the hypothesis that community
   diversity inhibits alien invasion. At the 1-m(2) point scale, where we
   would expect competitive interactions between the largely herbaceous
   flora to be most intense, alien species richness as well as alien cover
   increased with increasing native species richness in all communities.
   This suggests that aliens are limited not by the number of native
   competitors, but by resources that affect establishment of both natives
   and aliens.
   Blue-oak savannas were heavily dominated by alien species and
   consistently had more alien than native species at the 1-m(2) scale. All
   of these aliens are annuals, and it is widely thought that they have
   displaced native bunchgrasses. If true, this means that aliens have
   greatly increased species richness. Alternatively, there is a rich
   regional flora of native annual forbs that could have dominated these
   grasslands prior to displacement by alien grasses. On our sites,
   livestock grazing increased the number of alien species and alien cover
   only slightly over that of sites free of livestock grazing for more than
   a century, indicating some level of permanency to this invasion.
   In chaparral,,both diversity and aliens increased markedly several years
   after fire. Invasive species are rare in undisturbed shrublands, and
   alien propagules fail to survive the natural crown fires in these
   ecosystems. Thus, aliens necessarily must colonize after fire and, as a
   consequence, time since fire is an important determinant of invasive
   presence. Blue oak savannas are an important propagule source for alien
   species because they maintain permanent populations of all alien species
   encountered in postfire chaparral, and because the vegetation mosaic in
   this region places them in proximity to chaparral. The speed at which
   alien propagules reach a burned site and the speed at which the
   shrublands return to their former closed-canopy condition determine
   alien invasion. Frequent burning of this vegetation alters the balance
   in favor of alien invasion.
   In the higher-elevation coniferous forests, species diversity was a
   function of fire severity and time since fire. High-intensity fires
   create gaps that decrease canopy coverage and increase light levels and
   nutrients for an ephemeral successional flora. Few species have
   persistent seed banks, so the time since fire is an important
   determinant of colonization success. There was a highly significant
   interaction between fire severity and time since fire for understory
   cover, species richness, and alien richness and cover. Understory was
   sparse in the first year after fire, particularly in low-severity burns,
   and increased substantially several years after fire, particularly on
   high-severity burns. Both fire severity and time since fire affected
   alien species richness and dominance. Coniferous forests had about
   one-third as many alien species as the foothill oak savannas, and fewer
   than half of the species were shared between these communities. Unburned
   coniferous forests were largely free of alien species, whereas some
   burned sites had a significant alien presence, which presents a
   challenge for fire restoration of these forests.}},

Abstract = {{1. The effects of insects on primary production in temperate herbaceous
   communities were investigated in a meta-analysis. The following
   hypotheses were tested: ( 1) the effect of insects on primary production
   depends on community type, ( 2) the effect of insects on primary
   production varies as a function of productivity, ( 3) insects have a
   greater effect on primary production in communities with low species
   diversity, and ( 4) insects have a larger effect on primary production
   during outbreaks.
   2. Data were collected from 24 studies in which insecticides were used
   to suppress insects in self-sown or pastoral communities. Effect sizes
   were calculated from sprayed and control plot standing crop or yield,
   expressed as the log response ratio, ln ( sprayed plot phytomass/control
   plot phytomass).
   3. There was a significant increase in primary production as a result of
   insect suppression. Forb-dominated communities showed a more variable
   response than graminoid communities. During outbreaks, insects had a
   greater negative impact on primary production. Effect size was
   unaffected by productivity or plant species richness.
   4. Although insects lower primary production in a diversity of temperate
   herbaceous communities, the basic measures by which such communities are
   often described have little effect on the proportional impact that
   insects have on primary production. While outbreaks are significant
   predictors of higher negative impact on primary production, causes of
   outbreaks are not always related to traits of the plant community.}},

Abstract = {{Global change has many facets, of which land use and the change of
   atmospheric chemistry are unquestioned primary agents, which induce a
   suite of secondary effects, including climatic changes. The largest
   single contribution to the compositional change of the atmosphere, CO2
   enrichment, has (besides its influence on climate) immediate and direct
   effects on plants. Quantitatively, CO2 is the plant `food' number one,
   and the rate of photosynthetic CO2 uptake by leaves is not yet
   CO2-saturated. This abrupt change of the biosphere's diet does and will
   affect all aspects of life, including our food. However, the plant and
   ecosystem responses are more subtle than had been assumed from the
   results of responses of isolated, well-fertilized and well-watered
   plants in greenhouses during the early days Of CO2-enrichment research.
   In this article, I discuss potential responses of complex natural
   grassland and diverse forests, and address three key themes: CO2 and
   nutrients, CO2 and water; CO2 and plant-animal interactions. Examples
   from a suite of climatic regions emphasize that the most important
   ecosystem level responses to elevated CO2 Will be introduced by
   differential responses of species. Atmospheric CO2 enrichment is a
   biodiversity issue. Classical physiological baseline responses of leaves
   to elevated CO2 can be overrun by biodiversity effects to such an extent
   that some of the traditional predictions may even become reversed. For
   instance, biodiversity effects may cause humid tropical forests (those
   which avoid destruction) to become more dynamic and store less, rather
   than more, carbon as CO2 enrichment continues. The abundance of certain
   life forms and species and their lifespans exert major controls over the
   half-life of carbon stored in forest biomass, and there is evidence that
   elevated CO2 can affect these controls and most likely does so already.
   Also, long-term hydrological consequences of atmospheric CO2 enrichment
   will be driven by biodiversity effects, given that some, but not all,
   species reduce their rate of water loss when exposed to a CO2-rich
   atmosphere. Such insights call for much more realistic experimental
   conditions and larger-scale test units, which permit biotic interactions
   across taxa and trophic levels to occur while simulating our CO2 future.
   The evidence currently available suggests that ecosystem processes
   reflect the composition of their biological inventory and this will be
   affected by a shift in carbon supply.}},

Abstract = {{Prevalence, intensity and abundance of protostrongylid larvae in snails
   and slugs were studied on 10 sheep and goat pastures in the region of
   Stara Zagora, Southern Bulgaria, in 2001. Eight gastropod species were
   infected: Helicella obvia, Cernuella virgata, Monacha cartusiana,
   Zebrina detrita, Cepaea vindobonensis, Chondrula microtraga, Helix
   pomatia and Deroceras reticulatum. Four nematode species were
   identified: Muellerius capillaris, Neostrongylus linearis, Cystocaulus
   ocreatus and Protostrongylus sp. Helicella obvia was the most common and
   abundant snail, and showed the highest infection parameters. Cernuella
   virgata was the only species in one pasture and had high infection
   descriptors. Monacha cartusiana and Zebrina detrita had high infection
   levels in some pastures. A subset of data representing the infection of
   H. obvia was used to test for relationships with environmental
   characteristics. Protostrongylid infections in this host species showed
   considerable variation between sites. M. capillaris had the highest
   prevalence and intensity, followed by C. ocreatus and Protostrongylus
   sp. Comparisons of sites at lower vs at upper elevations did not show
   significant differences in infection, with the exception of
   Protostrongylus sp. The primary vegetation was the only explanatory
   variable for the total prevalence of protostrongylids. This variable, in
   a combination with altitude, mollusc species richness and sample size
   explained 73\% of the variation of mean intensity. In the models
   explaining variations in the prevalence and the mean intensity of the
   nematode species, 9 variables were included: primary vegetation,
   altitude, annual precipitation, mean annual precipitation, mollusc and
   nematode species richness, concentration of inorganic nitrogen in soil,
   snail population density and ratio between the number of goats and the
   number of sheep grazing on pasture. H. obvia was considered a suitable
   screening species for assessing the pasture contamination in the region.}},

Abstract = {{In order to achieve environmentally sound agriculture as well as a
   remuneration of ecological achievements on the farm level, practicable
   instruments for accurate measurement have to be developed. Whereas there
   are suitable indicators to assess agricultural impacts on abiotic
   resources, there is a lack of indicators for the assessment of biotic
   resources on the farm level. Proposals for and attempts at as well as
   first-hand experience in assessment methods of agricultural impacts on
   biotic resources exist in various European countries. A few of these
   methods require intensive measurements with a lot of indicators, but a
   sufficient assessment and evaluation of the biotic as well as the
   aesthetic resources (landscape structure/image) on the farm level has
   not yet been carried out.
   Biotic resource indicators of seven assessment methods (Ecopoints Lower
   Austria, Solagro, Halberg, Nature Balance Scheme, KUL, Frieben,
   Biodiversity Yardstick) from five European countries are compared with
   each other. Some of the methods register biotic resources only
   marginally by indirect measurements (indicators), respectively, or
   action-oriented indicators such as time of cutting/mowing, frequency of
   cutting/mowing, age of grassland, percentage of unsprayed area. Other
   methods are very complex, so that their implementation on a wide scale
   does not seem possible.
   There is a need to further develop and improve practicable and efficient
   tools in order to assess the agricultural impact on bio-resources on
   farm level and consequently in order to promote an environmentally sound
   agriculture. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In July 2000, a 490-ha wildfire burned a portion of a long-term grazing
   study that had been established in 1924 at the US Sheep Experiment
   Station north of Dubois, Idaho, USA. Earlier vegetation measurements in
   this tall threetip sagebrush (Artemisia tripartita spp. tripartita)
   bunchgrass plant community documented significant changes in vegetation
   due to grazing and the timing of grazing by sheep. A study was initiated
   in May 2001 using 12 multiscale modified Whittaker plots to determine
   the consequences of previous grazing practices on postfire vegetation
   composition. Because there was only one wildfire and it did not burn all
   of the original plots, the treatments are not replicated in time or
   space. We reduce the potential effects of psuedoreplication by confining
   our discussion to the sample area only. There were a total of 84 species
   in the sampled areas with 69 in the spring-grazed area and 70 each in
   the fall- and ungrazed areas. Vegetation within plots was equally rich
   and even with similar numbers of abundant species. The spring-grazed
   plots, however, had half as much plant cover as the fall- and ungrazed
   plots and the spring-grazed plots had the largest proportion of plant
   cover composed of introduced (27\%) and annual (34\%) plants. The
   fall-grazed plots had the highest proportion of native perennial grasses
   (43\%) and the lowest proportion of native annual forbs (1\%). The
   ungrazed plots had the lowest proportion of introduced plants (4\%) and
   the highest proportion of native perennial forbs (66\%). The vegetation
   of spring-grazed plots is in a degraded condition for the environment
   and further degradation may continue, with or without continued grazing
   or some other disturbance. If ecosystem condition was based solely on
   plant diversity and only a count of species numbers was used to
   determine plant diversity, this research would have falsely concluded
   that grazing and timing of grazing did not impact the condition of the
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{1. Plateau zokors, Myospalax fontanierii, are the only subterranean
   herbivores on the Tibetan plateau of China. Although the population
   biology of plateau zokors has been studied for many years, the
   interactions between zokors and plants, especially for the maintenance
   and structure of ecological communities, have been poorly recognized. In
   the past, plateau zokors have been traditionally viewed as pests,
   competitors with cattle, and agents of soil erosion, thus eradication
   programmes have been carried out by local governments and farmers.
   Zokors are also widely and heavily exploited for their use in
   traditional Chinese medicine.
   2. Like other fossorial animals, such as pocket gophers Geomys spp. and
   prairie dogs Cynomys spp. in similar ecosystems, zokors may act to
   increase local environmental heterogeneity at the landscape level, aid
   in the formation, aeration and mixing of soil, and enhance infiltration
   of water into the soil thus curtailing erosion. The changes that zokors
   cause in the physical environment, vegetation and soil clearly affect
   the herbivore food web. Equally, plateau zokors also provide a
   significant food source for many avian and mammalian predators on the
   plateau. Zokor control leading to depletion of prey and secondary
   poisoning may therefore present problems for populations of numerous
   other animals.
   3. We highlight the important role plateau zokors play in the Tibetan
   plateau ecosystem. Plateau zokors should be managed in concert with
   other comprehensive rangeland treatments to ensure the ecological
   equilibrium and preservation of native biodiversity, as well as the
   long-term sustainable use of pastureland by domestic livestock.}},

Abstract = {{Cades Cove, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, U.S.A. was historically
   cleared largely for pastoral purposes; it is now comprised of recently
   abandoned pastures dominated by non-native pasture species. To
   investigate the potential for reducing non-native species relative to
   native species, park managers initiated an experiment in 1995 that
   included mowing, herbicide application, planting of seed, and burning of
   replicate 20 x 50-m plots at each of two sites within Cades Cove.
   Between 1995 and 2001 we evaluated the response of the plant community
   (i.e., species-specific cover and frequency, biomass, diversity) to this
   suite of treatments and compared it with unmanipulated control plots at
   each site. Four years after treatment initiation abundance measures of
   Plantago lanceolata , Setaria geniculata , and Trifolium spp. averaged
   one-third lower in treated than control plots. Frequency of Festuca
   pratensis was lower in treated than in control plots for 2 years, but
   after 4 years its frequency, cover, and biomass did not differ between
   treated and control plots. By 2000 the cover of Sorghastrum nutans in
   treated plots increased to 23-47\%, depending on the site. Total biomass
   and diversity increased in treated plots. The dominance of Lespedeza
   cuneata at one site apparently reduced planting success, biomass
   production, and diversity and evenness. Post-treatment lags in response
   for several species, coupled with interannual variation in response to
   environmental conditions, suggest that evaluations of treatment success
   would differ greatly depending on when the evaluation was conducted.}},

   Harsh Climates, HAMMAMET, TUNISIA, NOV 08-10, 2001}},
Abstract = {{We contend diets and habitats that allow animals to select among
   alternatives enable individuals to better meet needs for nutrients and
   to better cope with toxins. All plants contain toxins, and the amount of
   toxin an animal can ingest depends on the kinds and amounts of nutrients
   and toxins in the forages on offer. Nutrients and toxins both cause
   animals to satiate, and excesses of nutrients, nutrient imbalances, and
   toxins all limit food intake. Thus, individuals can better meet their
   needs for nutrients and regulate their intake of toxins when offered a
   variety of foods that differ in nutrients and toxins than when
   constrained to a single food, even if the food is ``nutritionally
   balanced{''}. Food intake and preference also depend on differences in
   how individual animals are built morphologically and how they function
   physiologically, and marked variation is common even among closely
   related animals in needs for nutrients and abilities to cope with
   toxins. Transient food aversions compound the inefficiency of
   single-food diets-whether in confinement, on pastures, or on
   rangelands-by depressing intake among individual animals, even if they
   are suited ``on average{''} to that nutrient or toxin profile. Thus,
   feeding and grazing practices that allow producers to capitalize on the
   individuality of animals are likely to improve performance of the herd
   by enabling the uniqueness of individuals to become manifest. Finally,
   past experiences play a crucial role in an animal's propensity to learn
   to eat different foods. When herbivores are allowed to eat only the most
   preferred plants, they are not likely to learn to mix foods high in
   nutrients with foods that contain toxins. Conversely, herbivores
   encouraged to eat all plants in an area are more likely to learn to eat
   mixes of plants that mitigate toxicity. Experienced animals who have
   learned to eat a variety of foods that differ in nutrients and toxins do
   so even when nutritious alternatives are available, whereas naive
   animals familiar only with the nutritious alternatives eat only that
   subset of familiar foods. Different systems of management alter how
   animals forage. Continuous grazing at low stock densities encourages
   selectivity and reduces diet and habitat breadth, whereas short-duration
   grazing at high stock densities increases diet and habitat breadth.
   Thus, what was traditionally considered proper grazing
   management-rotational grazing at low stock densities-may have trained
   generations of livestock to ``eat the best and leave the rest{''} thus
   inadvertently accelerating a decline in biodiversity and an increase in
   the abundance of less desirable plant species. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science

Abstract = {{The spatial grazing patterns of red deer (Cervus elaphus L.) in a
   subalpine grassland ecosystem of the Swiss National Park were analysed
   with reference to the phosphorus content in the topsoil and to the
   former agricultural management system. Changes in the composition of the
   vegetation and in plant species richness were studied on permanent plots
   set up between 1917 and 1945 in areas which today are heavily grazed by
   red deer, and were related to the development of the red deer
   population.
   The spatial grazing patterns of red deer are, 80 years after the Park's
   foundation, still determined by former agricultural use. Red deer prefer
   the most phosphorus-rich, formerly irrigated parts for grazing.
   Grazing by red deer was found to be the driving force behind temporal
   changes in the vegetation observed on the subalpine grasslands. Plant
   succession has proceeded faster in the preferred grazing areas and the
   vegetation has adapted to the grazing pressure with a decrease in
   tall-growing plant species. At the same time, the abundance of
   unpalatable species has increased due to (i) morphological defences,
   (ii) spatial avoidance, i.e. by growing close to the ground and (iii)
   temporal avoidance because they have a short life-span (annuals).
   Changes in vegetation composition have coincided with a sharp increase
   in species richness. Between 1917 and 1999, the number of plant species
   has doubled on average. We found a highly significant correlation
   between the changes in the numbers of plant species and red deer, with
   species richness increasing with increasing deer density. (C) 2003

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) is an essential nutrient for plants and animals, and N may
   be limiting in many western US grassland and shrubland ungulate winter
   ranges. Ungulates may influence N pools and they may alter N inputs and
   outputs (losses) to the ecosystem in a number of ways. In this paper we
   compare the ecosystem effects of ungulate herbivory in two western
   national parks, Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP), Colorado, and
   Yellowstone National Park (YNP), Wyoming. We compare ungulate herbivory
   effects on N pools, N fluxes, N yields, and plant productivity in the
   context of the accelerating and decelerating nutrient cycling scenarios
   {[}Ecology 79 (1998) 165]. We concluded that the YNP grasslands fit the
   accelerating nutrient cycling scenario for ungulate herbivory: in
   response to grazing, grassland plant species abundance was largely
   unaltered, net annual aboveground primary productivity (NAPP) was
   stimulated (except during drought), consumption of key N-rich forages by
   ungulates was moderate and their abundance was sustained, soil N
   mineralization rates doubled, N pools increased, aboveground N yield
   increased, and N concentrations increased in most grassland plant
   species. Grazing in grasslands in RMNP resulted in no consistent
   detectable acceleration or deceleration of nutrient cycling. Grazing
   effects in short willow and aspen vegetation types in RMNP fit the
   decelerating nutrient cycling scenario of Ritchie et al. {[}Ecology 79
   (1998) 165]. Key N-rich forages declined due to herbivory (willows,
   aspen, herbaceous vegetation). Aboveground production declined, soil N
   mineralization rates declined, N pools declined (NO3- pools were 30\%
   that of ungrazed controls), and aboveground N yield declined. We believe
   that the higher ungulate densities and rates of plant consumption in
   RMNP, large declines in N-rich forage plants, and possibly a tendency of
   ungulates to move N from willow and aspen vegetation types to other
   types in RMNP, contributed to deceleration of nutrient cycling in two
   vegetation types in RMNP compared to acceleration in grasslands in YNP.

Abstract = {{Potential effects of herbivores on plant species diversity depend on
   herbivore size, species and density. In this study we examine the effect
   of different-sized herbivores (cattle and rabbits) on recruitment of
   subordinate herbs in grasslands. We show that in a grazed floodplain,
   grassland plant species richness is mainly determined by the presence of
   many species of subordinate herbs. These herbs experience high
   colonization and extinction rates. We conclude that the creation of
   colonization opportunities for subordinate herbs plays a crucial role in
   maintaining plant species richness in productive grasslands. We found
   that cattle disperse large amounts of seeds via their dung, over ten
   times more than rabbits. Rabbits create more and on average larger bare
   soil patches than cattle. In a field experiment artificial disturbances
   improved germination success tremendously for four tested herb species.
   We found that bare soil is the best regeneration site, while cattle dung
   gave a too strong nutrient stimulus, resulting in tall vegetation and
   therefore light limitation. These results can be confirmed with results
   from field monitoring plots where plant species richness was positively
   related to the occurrence of bare soil patches. Therefore both large and
   small herbivores have a major impact on dispersal and colonization, but
   for different reasons. Cattle are identified as most important for seed
   dispersal whereas rabbits have a main effect as creators of
   disturbances. These results emphasize the importance of distinguishing
   between herbivore species in assessing their (potential) effects.}},

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{The idea of the diversity-productivity relationship in ecology was
   originated by Charles Darwin more than 100 years ago and was highlighted
   by McNaughton in 1993. There have been extensive studies on this
   relationship, mostly conducted in grasslands. Many studies assert that a
   high level of biodiversity leads to high primary productivity, in accord
   with Darwin. However, these studies have mostly been done in grasslands
   (primary producer) and do not take into account effects from other
   trophic levels. The possibility remains that the positive
   diversity-production relationship does not hold in other types of
   ecological systems and that multitrophic effects influence and modify
   the relationship. In the present study, the diversity-productivity
   relationship is examined for freshwater foodwebs, including whole
   trophic compartments, by using indices of diversity and productivity
   more suitable for a whole systemic study on ecological systems. It seems
   that there are two trends in the relationship: productivity increases
   with the increase of diversity in ecosystems when diversity is small,
   and decreases with diversity in ecosystems when diversity is large. The
   first trend may be due to nutrient-limiting characteristics and the
   second trend may be due to photosynthetically active radiation-limiting
   characteristics. Also, both higher trophic and whole-systemic
   productivities are found to increase relative to primary productivity
   with the increase of diversity. Stability indices introduced previously,
   combined with the present results, reveal a positive correlation between
   relative productivity and stability in freshwater foodwebs, including
   all trophic compartments.}},

Abstract = {{Trichostome ciliates are associated with many different lineages of
   herbivorous mammals but there are few comparative studies of these
   associations in each lineage of herbivores. Here the occurrence of the
   ciliate fauna in a range of herbivorous marsupials (diprotodonts) is
   investigated and compared with that of ruminants. A total of 371
   potential host animals, representing 33 species and 7 families, were
   examined for the presence of ciliates. The prevalence of endocommensal
   ciliates within individual host species varied between 0 and 100\%. Of
   the different dietary groups of marsupials examined, only foregut
   (macropodids) and hindgut (vombatids) fermentative herbivores were found
   to harbour ciliates; carnivorous (dasyurids), omnivorous (peramelids)
   and midgut fermenting herbivores (phalangeroids) all lacked ciliates.
   The majority of ciliate species were oioxenic, several occurred in
   closely related hosts and some were able to colonise unnatural hosts in
   captive populations. Ciliate prevalences were found to vary at all
   levels: between hosts of different species, between conspecific hosts
   collected at different localities or seasons and between conspecific
   hosts at one collecting locality. The faunal composition of the 2
   marsupial families which harboured ciliates differed greatly: the
   vombatid fauna was composed exclusively of amylovoracids whereas the
   macropodids harboured amylovoracids, polycostids and macropodiniids. In
   comparison to the ciliate fauna of ruminants, the fauna of macropodids
   is both depauperate and much more host specific. Low species richness in
   each host may be due to the large numbers of stomach nematodes in
   macropodids which compete with and may prey upon the ciliates within the
   stomach. The high levels of host specificity are probably due to
   different patterns of ciliate transmission in macropodids as they do not
   ruminate, eructate or feed indiscriminantly on pasture contaminated with
   saliva containing ciliates.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) provides habitat for grassland birds,
   but as contracts expire, some CRP fields might be returned to rowcrop
   production. One alternative to returning CRP fields to rowcrops is to
   produce switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) for use as a biomass fuel.
   Because the biomass is harvested during the fall and winter, breeding
   birds would not be directly affected by mowing the fields but might be
   influenced by changes in vegetation structure resulting from the
   harvest. We evaluated bird abundances and nest success in totally,
   harvested, partially harvested (alternating cut and uncut strips), and
   nonharvested CRP switchgrass fields in southern Iowa, USA, in 1999 and
   2000. Species richness did not differ among harvest treatments.
   Abundances of most species (16 of 18) were not affected by the
   harvesting of switchgrass fields, and strip width did not affect bird
   numbers in strip-harvested fields. Grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus
   savannarum) were more abundant in harvested portions of fields, and more
   sedge wrens (Cistothorus platensis) were recorded in nonharvested areas.
   The residual vegetation in nonharvested areas provided nest cover for
   species that begin nesting early in the season (e.g., northern harrier
   {[}Circus cyaneus] and ring-necked pheasant {[}Phasianus colchicus]).
   Nest success rates of grasshopper sparrows and common yellowthroats
   (Geothlypis trichas) were similar to those reported by other studies in
   switchgrass fields and might be sufficient to maintain stable
   populations. In general, switchgrass biomass fields create breeding
   habitat for some grassland birds, and a Mixture of harvested and
   nonharvested fields would be more beneficial to grassland birds than
   totally harvesting or partially harvesting all switchgrass fields.}},

Abstract = {{Despite considerable recent interest in how biodiversity may influence
   ecosystem properties, the issue of how plant diversity and composition
   may affect multiple trophic levels in soil food webs remains essentially
   unexplored. We conducted a glasshouse experiment in which three plant
   species of each of three functional groups (grasses, N-fixing legumes
   and forbs) were grown in monoculture and in mixtures of three species
   (with the three species being in the same or different functional
   groups) and all nine species. Plant species identity had important
   effects on the biomasses or population densities of belowground primary
   consumers (microbial biomass, herbivorous nematodes) and two groups of
   secondary consumers (microbe-feeding nematodes and enchytraeids); the
   third consumer trophic level (predatory nematodes) was marginally not
   significantly affected at P = 0.05. Plant species also influenced the
   relative importance of the bacterial-based and fungal-based energy
   channels for both the primary and secondary consumer trophic levels.
   Within-group diversity of only the soil microflora and herbivorous
   nematodes (both representing the basal consumer trophic level) were
   affected by plant species identity. However, community composition
   within all trophic groupings considered (herbivorous nematodes,
   microbes, microbe-feeding nematodes, predatory nematodes) was strongly
   influenced by what plant species were present. Despite the strong
   responses of the soil biota to plant species identity, there were few
   effects of plant species or functional group richness on any of the
   belowground response variables measured. Further, net primary
   productivity (NPP) was unaffected by plant diversity. Since some
   belowground response variables were correlated with NPP across
   treatments, it is suggested that belowground responses to plant
   diversity might become more apparent in situations when NIPP itself
   responds to plant diversity. Our results point to plant species identity
   as having important multitrophic effects on soil food webs, both at the
   whole trophic group and within-group levels of resolution, and suggest
   that differences in plant traits across species may be important in
   driving the decomposer subsystem.}},

Abstract = {{Much of the observed variation in relationships between diversity and
   disturbance or productivity may be attributed to scale, species
   characteristics, or environment. We used exclusion fences to create
   gradients of grazing (by native and introduced herbivores), cover, and
   standing crop in temperate Eucalypt woodlands. We investigated patterns
   of native, exotic, and total plant species richness at two scales (1
   m(2) and 625 m(2)). Richness patterns were similar at both scales,
   though species richness at 1m(2) was more strongly affected by our
   grazing treatments. Season and rainfall explained more variation in
   richness than did surrogate measures of productivity or disturbance by
   herbivores. The richness-herbivory relationship depended strongly on
   rainfall, season, and species origin, and altering these factors
   produced the entire range of observed diversity-disturbance
   relationships. Richness-biomass and richness-cover relationships were
   consistently hump-shaped, and related to species origin with native
   richness negatively related and exotic richness positively related. The
   ability of weedy annuals to pre-empt space after death may have
   contributed to the observed unimodal responses.}},

Abstract = {{Apart from experimental design, the selection of pitfall trap size,
   collecting fluid and habitat type sampled may also influence the capture
   efficiency of the method. We combined three field studies from two very
   different geographic areas, in which the efficiency of pitfall traps,
   using carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae), is evaluated. First, we
   showed that ethylene-glycol is a more efficient collecting fluid
   compared to commercial anti-freeze, paraffin and salt water in
   collecting beetles in a forest patch in South Africa. Second, we showed
   that larger traps (90 mm mouth diameter) are more efficient in
   collecting carabids than small traps (65 mm) in a meadow in Finland. We
   also showed that for these large traps, commercial vinegar was a better
   collecting fluid than propylene-glycol, but that for small traps,
   propylene-glycol was superior to vinegar in collecting carabids.
   Finally, we showed that the trappability of Pterostichus
   oblongopunctatus and Carabus hortensis differed in enclosures placed
   into two different habitat types (a forest and a clear-cut in Finland),
   while trappability did not differ significantly for two other species
   (Calathus micropterus and Pterostichus niger) in these habitat types.
   However, for the two Pterostichus species studied, the catches in traps
   placed in the centre of the enclosures were slightly higher in the
   clear-cut, compared to the forest, and catches were higher in enclosures
   with rich field-layer vegetation, compared to enclosures with poor
   vegetation. The three studies re-emphasise the uncertainties of using
   pitfall traps in ecological studies. However, with careful planning and
   standardisation to help avoid erroneous interpretations, pitfall
   trapping is an invaluable method for the field ecologist.}},

Abstract = {{Alkali vegetation has been a recurrent research object of Hungarian
   botany. Studies on landscape history and vegetation dynamics beginning
   in the 1990s amplified considerably our knowledge of alkali vegetation.
   The present paper features some thoughts about the origins of the alkali
   vegetation, summarises its principal characteristics, and presents some
   new views on the primary versus secondary status of this vegetation type
   in Hungary. The origins of alkali vegetation linked to pastures, low
   sensitivity to disturbance, and quick regeneration potential of alkali
   vegetation are emphasised in relation to nature conservation.
   Semi-natural alkali vegetation covers approx. 150,000 ha in Hungary, and
   includes steppes, steppic pastures, meadows, marshes, lakes, and
   woodlands characterised by endemic, Pontic, and Southern-Eurasian
   species. Altogether 53 plant communities belong chiefly to the three
   major vegetation classes, such as the Thero-Suaedetea, the Crypsidetea
   aculeatae, and the Festuco-Puccinellietea. Alkali steppes were initially
   supporting native ungulates, then nomadic herds, and finally served for
   extensive grazing later in history. In the past 150 years, ploughing,
   amelioration of grasslands, and drainage led to demisse or degradation
   of many alkali habitats.
   Through an ``experiment by chance{''} we document that floodplain
   meadows were transformed to short-grass secondary alkali steppes and
   loess steppes, while marshes were transformed into alkali meadows. By
   comparing the species composition, vegetation mosaic patterns, soil
   types, and entire landscape context of 19 alkali oak woodlands, we
   demonstrate that although these woodlands are partly primary, a greater
   part can be derived from oak-elm-ash woodlands due to desiccation and
   alkalisation processes.
   We provide new support for the old, and generally disregarded,
   hypothesis claiming that solonetz vegetation has two sources of origin:
   before and after river regulations. Primary vegetation is characterised
   by contrasted vegetation mosaics, species richness, well-developed
   alkali geomorphology, and the lack or subordination of floodplain
   species. Primary alkali steppes, several thousand years old, occur as
   patches as large as 100 - 1000 ha in the Tiszantul region.}},

Volume = {{96}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Bayesian belief network (Fully Connected Belief Networks, FC BeNe) was
   used to estimate uncertainty in the functioning of established buffer
   zones in Finland. Four experts in the field of water protection and four
   in biodiversity were asked to assess the roles of 25 key variables
   involved in the functioning of buffer zones. The matrix comprised five
   levels of information: field properties, buffer zone properties,
   management measures, site data and concerns. The eight experts were
   asked to estimate probability distributions and causal relationships
   between the 25 variables, which included in particular erosion, particle
   bound P, dissolved P, and plant, insect and bird species diversity. Any
   of the three phases of the analysis; prior distributions, links and
   posterior distributions are end products which are usable as such.
   The highest uncertainties were attributed to management measures, e.g.
   sowing leys, meadow plants, trees and/or bushes and soil removal from
   the upper end of the field in order to create nutrient-poor meadows.
   Uncertainties were also seen in P-status, fertilizer and manure changes,
   transport of dissolved phosphorus, particle bound phosphorus, bird
   species diversity and landscape. All experts thought that erosion
   affects particle bound phosphorus, but there was wide deviation in the
   link strength values, 0.05-0.7, which clearly reflects a lack of
   knowledge. Two of the experts assumed particle bound P to become partly
   dissolved, the other two did not. The effect of buffer zones on
   transport of dissolved phosphorus was not clear. The link strength
   direction of the variables grazing and rotational grazing to dissolved P
   varied between the experts.
   According to the expert evaluations, positive impacts caused by buffer
   zones were probable in erosion, and in plant and insect species
   diversity, which is in agreement with existing empirical studies.
   Experts expected plant height to be beneficial to bird species
   diversity, but disagreed as to the effect of plant height on plant and
   insect species diversity. Biodiversity experts considered that steep
   slopes produced more erosion, more leaching, and hence more patches for
   biodiversity contrary to water pollution. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{The biodiversity of species-rich semi-natural meadows is declining
   across Europe due to ceased management. In this study we aimed to find
   out how successfully the local species richness of an overgrown
   semi-natural mesic meadow could be restored by sheep grazing after a
   long period of abandonment. The cover of vascular plant species in
   grazed plots and ungrazed exclosures was studied for five years and the
   responses of different functional plant groups were followed (herbs vs
   grasses, tall vs short species, species differing in flowering time,
   species representing different Grime's CSR strategies and species
   indicative of rich vs poor soil). Grazing increased species number by
   nearly 30\%. On grazed plots the litter cover practically disappeared,
   favouring small herbs such as Rhinanthus minor, Ranunculus acris,
   Trifolium pratense and the grass Agrostis capillaris. Grazing decreased
   the cover of the late flowering tall herb Epilobium angustifolium but
   had no effect on the abundance of the early flowering tall herbs
   Anthriscus sylvestris or Geranium sylvaticum. We suggest that to succeed
   in restoration it is useful to determine the responses of different
   functional plant groups to grazing. Grassland managers need this
   information to optimize the methods and timing of management used in
   restoration. Additional management practices, such as mowing, may be
   needed in mesic meadows to decrease the dominance of tall species. The
   availability of propagules seemed to restrict further increase of
   species richness in our study area.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of different forms of land use on germination and
   establishment of the rare fen species Succisella inflexa were
   investigated in seed introduction experiments in a mown and an abandoned
   fen meadow in SE Germany. Treatments included abandonment, mowing in
   fall and mowing with creation of gaps in the moss and litter layer.
   Floating capacity of seeds was tested in order to estimate potential
   dispersal by water.
   On the mown meadow, gaps had a slightly positive effect on germination
   rates, while greatly increasing seedling survival until the next spring.
   At the abandoned site, litter inhibited germination, whereas mosses had
   a negative effect on germination and a positive effect on survival rates
   during the first year after germination. Both germination and seedling
   establishment were negatively affected by the presence of slug
   herbivores. On the abandoned site, no seedlings at all survived until
   the next spring. Even though seeds of Succisella inflexa were capable to
   float for several weeks and to germinate thereafter, the situation at
   the field sites indicates that long-distance dispersal is highly
   unlikely. Our results showed that not only direct effects of
   abandonment, such as accumulation of litter, may have led to poor
   germination and poor seedling establishment of the species.
   Additionally, indirect consequences of changes in land use, such as
   higher seedling herbivory by slugs and successional vegetation changes
   due to abandonment, were important in determining habitat quality and
   availability of microsites for seedling recruitment. Furthermore, early
   mowing imposed seed limitation on plant populations.}},

Abstract = {{The short-term (4-year period) effects of different management regimes
   on the response of calcareous grassland vegetation to increased nitrogen
   were investigated. Four levels of nitrogen and two levels. of management
   were applied in a factorial design. Besides, the effects of management
   practices alone on species diversity were also studied. Species
   diversity was investigated at different levels of sub-sampling using a
   nested plot design. In this way, both species saturation and
   accumulation curves could be established. The effect of community
   structure, as reflected by the light regimes at various heights in the
   vegetation, on species diversity was also investigated. Species
   diversity at all levels of sub-sampling decreased significantly with
   management regimes and nitrogen supply rates. Percent light penetration
   differed significantly among management regimes and nitrogen supply
   rates. Grazing proved to be most efficient in countering the negative
   effects of nitrogen supply, but could not prevent competitors from
   becoming dominant. In the absence of any form of disturbance, species
   diversity decreased relatively rapidly. Decreased light availability,
   the loss of gap formation, a decrease in small-scale environmental
   heterogeneity and proliferation of strong competitors, all may have
   contributed to the observed decrease in species richness. The results of
   this study highlight the importance of management in maintaining high

   15 years of pasture (NR). Cattle graze frequently in the last three
   sites but very seldom in LD. The little disturbed site had more species
   (53) than the other three sites (36, 25, and I I species in GF, OG, and
   NG, respectively) and also more (3253, 2780, 2780, and 2115 plants/ha)
   and larger plants (34.8, 26.8, 18.6, and 7.8 m(2)/ha), including taller
   tree species (up to 15 m) absent in the other sites (maximum height: 14,
   6, and 5 m). Differences were striking in relation to NR, the site with
   longer use and shorter regrowth period, which was strongly dominated by
   only two species: Mimosa tenuiflora (73\% relative density and 81\%
   basal area) and Piptadenia stipulacea (21\% relative density and 16\%
   basal area). These results indicate that abandoned agricultural sites
   may take several decades to reestablish vegetation similar to the

Abstract = {{Alpine pastures are characterized by considerable spatial variation in
   the species richness and species composition of the vegetation. This
   paper examines how agricultural management and site factors influence
   the diversity of pasture vegetation in the north-eastern Swiss Alps,
   based on a survey of vegetation and soils in a total of 200 plots (1
   m(2)) on ten Alpine farms. The mean number of vascular plant species per
   plot differed significantly among farms (between 3 and 32 species
   m(-2)); it was strongly correlated with the total number of species per
   farm (r = 0.85), and both were negatively correlated with the farm area
   but unrelated to pasture use. The species number per m2 was negatively
   correlated to the phosphorus content of the soil and positively
   correlated to soil pH, whereas its relationship with the N- and
   C-content of the soil and with the average nutrient indicator value of
   the vegetation was unimodal. The ``potential species richness{''}
   (maximum number per m(2)) and the calculated ``species pool{''} (total
   number per 20 plots) showed similar types of relationships with site
   conditions. Out of the 164 plant species recorded in the survey, five
   were most common in species-poor plots, while 36 were most common in
   species rich plots. Overall, large variations in plot data resulted in a
   weak relationship between species richness, soil conditions and
   management. This may be due to the fact that multiple factors
   simultaneously influence the vegetation on Alpine pastures; these
   factors are partly interdependent and their effects on species richness
   may interact with each other.}},

Abstract = {{The prealpine calcareous grasslands of the Vercors Natural Park
   (Rhones-Alpes, France) occurring in mountainous areas of south-eastern
   France have been poorly studied, although they provide suitable habitat
   for rare plant species especially orchids. In this study, we focused on
   the effects of habitat conditions and management regimes on their
   population assemblages (composition, structure, species-richness) in
   order to define adequate conservation management for the maintenance of
   species-rich orchid assemblages on both habitat and management
   gradients. The results showed that the grasslands of the Vercors Natural
   Park are characterized by the presence of species-rich orchid
   communities. This species-richness could be explained by the existence
   of a particular set of habitat conditions and management regimes where
   the following variables have the most significant effect (elevation,
   temperature, folding enclosure surface, type of herd and duration of
   grazing). Three response groups based on the measurement of orchid
   biological traits (e.g. biogeographical distribution, plant height,
   flowering periods, reproduction types) could be identified following the
   combination of habitat conditions and management regimes. In conclusion,
   two types of management systems could be proposed in accordance with the
   existence of two types of substrate (urgonian and marly limestone) to
   conserve the species-rich orchid communities of the Vercors Natural

Abstract = {{Grazing and fire and are major forces shaping patterns of native and
   exotic species diversity in many grasslands, yet both of these
   disturbances have notoriously variable effects. Few studies have
   examined how landscape-level heterogeneity in grassland characteristics,
   such as soil-based variation in biomass and species composition, may
   contribute to variation in the effects of fire or grazing. We studied
   the effects of livestock grazing and fire in a mosaic of serpentine and
   nonserpentine soils in California, where most grasslands are dominated
   by exotic annuals and serpentine soil is the major refuge for native
   grassland species. We predicted that the effects of disturbance would be
   proportional to productivity and therefore would be greater on
   nonserpentine than serpentine soils. We measured species composition at
   80-100 grazed or ungrazed sites for 2 years before (1998-1999) and 2
   years after (2000-2001) an autumn wildfire. Both disturbances increased
   total species richness on both soils. However, fire enhanced total and
   exotic species richness more on nonserpentine soils and enhanced native
   species richness more on serpentine soils. Grazing increased native
   species richness on serpentine soils but not on nonserpentine soils.
   These soil-disturbance interactions suggest that the use of fire and
   grazing to manage native species diversity in wildlands must be done
   with careful attention to background ecological heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{1. Livestock grazing enterprises have potentially threatening effects on
   the conservation of plants in grassy subtropical eucalypt woodlands.
   Commercial levels of grazing could cause local extinctions of sensitive
   native species and/or reductions in abundance and species richness in
   native pastures.
   2. We studied the nature of grazing impacts on the diversity and
   composition of herbaceous plants and used a natural experiment to
   analyse the effects of disturbances (cattle grazing, soil disturbance,
   water enrichment) and environment (lithology, slope position, presence
   of trees) on plant community composition in eastern Australia. We
   sampled pastures and reserves at 191 sites over an area of 3000 ha.
   3. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to explore the
   relative importance of disturbance and environment in accounting for
   floristic variation and to examine individual species responses. From
   individual responses, we identified seven response groups relating to
   grazing. The factors analysed explained small but significant amounts of
   floristic variation, and there were interactions between soil
   disturbance, water enrichment and grazing.
   4. We explored the hypothesis that grazing increased species density at
   small scales but decreased it at landscape scales, due to the
   elimination of grazing-sensitive species. Our data did not support the
   hypothesis, as there were similar numbers of species that increase with
   grazing (increasers) and species that decline with increasing grazing
   (decreasers) in the assemblage. However, there were more native
   decreasers and more exotic increasers in the assemblage.
   5. Synthesis and applications. For land managers to retain plant
   diversity on grazed landscapes, it would be desirable to provide all
   levels of grazing pressure across the landscape, including areas
   protected from livestock grazing. This would apply to all plant
   communities where both grazing increasers and decreasers are present.
   Extensive areas supporting grassland with a tall tussock structure that
   is selectively grazed are most important, as all plant response groups
   have some representation and ecosystem function is retained under
   moderate grazing. In terms of regional conservation planning, the
   protection and enlargement of areas protected from livestock grazing is
   important in the study area, as these occur on only about 4\% of the
   landscape and are threatened by on-going disturbances and land-use
   intensification.}},

Abstract = {{We report the successional trends of the major life-forms (graminoids
   and forbs) in natural grasslands of Uruguay over a 9-yr period after the
   removal of domestic herbivores. For the whole community, species
   richness and diversity decreased over the successional period. In
   graminoids we observed clear temporal trajectories in floristic
   composition; the rate of floristic change decreased with time and was
   associated with a shift in plant traits. The exclusion of large
   herbivores promoted erect and tall grasses with narrow leaves and
   greater seed length, vegetative growth constrained to the cool season
   and increased frequency of annual species. Forbs did not show a clear
   temporal trend in species composition, but there was, nevertheless, a
   plot-specific species turnover of this functional group that was
   reflected in their attributes. Species spreading by means of rhizomes,
   with vegetative growth restricted to the warm season. Species with
   larger seeds increased under grazing exclusion, as did annual and
   nitrogen-fixing forbs. The floristic changes induced by cattle exclusion
   occurred early in the succession. This early high rate of change has
   practical implications for management and conservation programs of the
   natural grasslands of Uruguay. Additionally, the shift in plant traits
   may be helpful in devising simple indicators of grazing impact.}},

   forage in the following spring and summer. These effects were examined
   on rough fescue (Festuca scabrella Torr.) range on the Blackfoot
   Clearwater Wildlife Management Area in west central Montana. Cattle were
   grazed in enclosures during the fall of 1997 and 1998. A randomized
   complete block design with 5 replications of enclosures per year was
   used. Grazing levels were 0\% removal (control), 50\% removal, 70\%
   removal, and 90\% removal of herbaceous standing crop. To evaluate elk
   and deer forage, measurements were obtained in spring and summer on
   green grass standing crop, green forb standing crop, percent green
   vegetation, species richness, and plant species composition. There were
   no differences among grazing levels for plant species composition based
   on canopy coverage, species richness, and green forb standing crop
   variables ( P > 0.10). The 50\% and 90\% treatments reduced green
   standing crop in spring (P = 0.07) but not in summer (P > 0.10). Grazing
   treatments increased percent green vegetation (P < 0.01). Fall cattle
   grazing can be used as a wildlife habitat improvement tool to reduce
   unpalatable standing dead material. The 70\% removal treatment was the
   most favorable for habitat improvement without degrading the range.}},

   manure. The study was conducted at the Debre Zeit station of the
   International Livestock Research Institute, located 5 km from Addis
   Ababa in the Ethiopian highlands. The aim of the study was to assess the
   effect of manure on botanical composition, plant biomass, and water
   infiltration rates. There were 3 treatments: no grazing, moderate
   grazing (MDG = 1.8 animal unit months {[}AUM]/hectare), and heavy
   grazing (HVG = 4.2 AUM/hectare), each replicated 4 times. Removing cow
   dung from grazed plots decreased biomass production. Species richness
   was higher on manured plots than on nonmanured plots. The water
   infiltration rate was low on grazed and nongrazed plots with no manure
   when compared with the manured plots.}},

Abstract = {{To understand ``adjacency arrangement{''} (configuration of a patch and
   its adjoining elements) as a basic unit of landscape pattern, we studied
   30 woodland patches (Populus tremuloides) in Alberta, Canada, with
   adjacent vegetation varying from 0\% shrubland (100\% grassland) to
   100\% shrubland (0\% grassland). We evaluated (1) how important
   adjacency effects are relative to resource availability and disturbance
   in affecting plant species richness and composition in the woodland
   understory, and (2) which species and species groups change in abundance
   and presence with increasing percent shrubland in the adjacency
   arrangement. We found that, in addition to topography and previous
   grazing, adjacency arrangement is a major significant variable affecting
   the vegetation composition of woodland patches. Along a gradient from
   0\% to 100\% adjacent shrubland, the species composition in woodland
   patches changed from an abundance of weedy and introduced plants to an
   abundance of moist-environment plants, the proportion of native species
   and perennials increased linearly, the number of ``shrubland species{''}
   increased linearly, ``grassland species{''} decreased linearly, and
   total species richness remained constant. Woodland vegetation did not
   differ significantly where adjacent shrubland was to the east or to the
   west of the wooded patch, nor between patches which did or did not
   experience a change in the adjacent shrubland in the recent past. We
   conclude that adjacency arrangement is an easily measured, highly
   promising concept for ecological understanding, as well as for land
   planning, design, conservation and management.}},

Abstract = {{Roads are believed to be a major contributing factor to the ongoing
   spread of exotic plants. We examined the effect of road improvement and
   environmental variables on exotic and native plant diversity in roadside
   verges and adjacent semiarid grassland, shrubland, and woodland
   communities of southern Utah (U.S.A.). We measured the cover of exotic
   and native species in roadside verges and both the richness and cover of
   exotic and native species in adjacent interior communities (50 m beyond
   the edge of the road cut) along 42 roads stratified by level of road
   improvement (paved, improved surface, graded, and four-wheel-drive
   track). In roadside verges along paved roads, the cover of Bromus
   tectorum was three times as great (27\%) as in verges along
   four-wheel-drive tracks (9\%). The cover of five common exotic forb
   species tended to be lower in verges along four-wheel-drive tracks than
   in verges along more improved roads. The richness and cover of exotic
   species were both more than 50\% greater, and the richness of native
   species was 30\% lower, at interior sites adjacent to paved roads than
   at those adjacent to four-wheel-drive tracks. In addition, environmental
   variables relating to dominant vegetation, disturbance, and topography
   were significantly correlated with exotic and native species richness
   and cover. Improved roads can act as conduits for the invasion of
   adjacent ecosystems by converting natural habitats to those highly
   vulnerable to invasion. However, variation in dominant vegetation, soil
   moisture, nutrient levels, soil depth, disturbance, and topography may
   render interior communities differentially susceptible to invasions
   originating from roadside verges. Plant communities that are both
   physically invasible (e.g., characterized by deep or fertile soils) and
   disturbed appear most vulnerable. Decision-makers considering whether to
   build, improve, and maintain roads should take into account the
   potential spread of exotic plants.}},

Pages = {{920-931}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies indicate that plant species richness and primary
   productivity of grasslands may be limited by seed availability. However,
   it is not known how widespread this limitation is, whether it is
   affected by disturbance, or which mechanisms underlie any disturbance
   effect. We tested for seed limitation and explored the role of litter
   accumulation in explaining effects of recent grazing history on seedling
   establishment, species diversity (richness and evenness), and plant
   productivity in a subhumid grassland ecosystem in Texas, USA. We added
   seeds and removed litter in a factorial treatment arrangement (seeds
   added, litter removed, seeds added and litter removed, and control {[}no
   seeds added nor litter removed]) within each of five fields: currently
   grazed, no grazing for 1-2, 2-3, or 6-7 yr, and an unplowed prairie
   remnant. Seeds from each of 20 native species were added to replicated
   1-m(2) plots in each field during each of two growing seasons.
   Adding seeds increased seedling emergence in all fields, but this
   increase was much greater when litter was removed, especially in
   ungrazed fields. Counter to our expectations, seedling emergence
   increased with time since grazing when litter was removed and was
   greatest in fields not grazed for 1-3 yr when litter was present. As
   expected, light availability at the soil surface decreased with time
   since grazing. However, soil water availability to 15 cm depth increased
   with time since grazing, suggesting that limits on seedling emergence
   changed from water to light with time since grazing.
   Aboveground productivity during the second year of the study was
   significantly reduced following seed additions in the four fields along
   the grazing gradient, primarily because of a decrease in the
   productivity of C-4 grasses. Species diversity decreased with time since
   grazing. Seed additions slightly increased species richness but
   decreased species evenness in fields located along the grazing gradient,
   resulting in no net effect on diversity. In the more species-rich
   prairie remnant, seediadditions had no effect on aboveground
   productivity or species richness or evenness. These results suggest that
   seedling emergence does not relate linearly to time since grazing and
   that seed availability does not limit productivity and diversity in
   these subhumid grasslands.}},

Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},

Abstract = {{1. The compound influence of habitat complexity and patch size on stream
   invertebrate assemblages associated with submerged macrophytes was
   investigated through field sampling of two natural macrophyte species
   with contrasting leaf morphologies (complex, Ranunculus yezoensis ;
   simple, Sparganium emersum ) and an experiment with two artificial
   plants with different levels of morphological complexity.
   2. The artificial plant experiment was designed to separate the effects
   of habitat area (patch size) and habitat complexity, thus enabling a
   more rigorous assessment of complexity per se than in previous studies
   where only a single patch size was used. Simple and complex artificial
   plants were established with five different patch sizes corresponding to
   the range found in natural plants.
   3. Invertebrates occurred on both complex and simple forms of natural
   and artificial plants at similar abundances with dipterans and
   ephemeropterans being predominant. Taxon richness was higher on
   structurally complex Ranunculus than on simple Sparganium and was
   similarly higher on the complex artificial plant than on the simple one,
   over the entire range of habitat patch sizes. Thus, architectural
   complexity affected the taxon richness of epiphytic invertebrates,
   independently of habitat scale.
   4. On the natural plants there was no difference in the abundance (both
   number of individuals and biomass) of invertebrates between simple and
   complex forms, while on artificial plants more invertebrates occurred on
   complex than on simple forms. The amount of particulate organic matter,
   >225 mum (POM) and chlorophyll a showed mixed patterns on natural and
   artificial plants, suggesting that the availability of these resources
   is not an overriding proximate factor controlling invertebrate abundance
   on plants. The difficulty of extrapolating from experimental results
   involving use of artificial plants is discussed, especially when
   considering the relationship between habitat structure and the
   occurrence of epiphytic invertebrates on natural plants.}},

Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{301-307}},

Abstract = {{Livestock production extends to most non-forested, marginal, upland
   habitats of Britain. Of these, indigenous grasslands are stocked
   predominantly by sheep, stocking densities having increased in Scotland
   by 25\% between 1975 and 1990. Conversely, the national herd of cattle
   in Scotland declined by 22\% over the same period. The effects of
   grazing management on arthropod distribution and abundance is reviewed,
   with particular emphasis on the results of grazing experiments that have
   investigated the effects on arthropods of varied livestock species and
   stocking rates. Arthropods contribute the most species of any taxa in
   the uplands and are critical in upland food chains. The direction and
   magnitude of the response of different arthropod taxa to grazing
   management reflects their trophic level, life history, size and
   mobility, e.g., 30\% of ground and rove beetle species are more
   sensitive to landform than grazing management. For the arthropod taxa
   that are sensitive to grazing management, the effects are generally
   indirect, via changes in the heterogeneity of botanical composition and
   vegetation structure. A mosaic of contrasting botanical composition and
   structural heterogeneity is essential to conserve and enhance arthropod
   and broader wildlife diversity in the uplands. However, the
   landscape-scale study of mammalian herbivore-vegetation-arthropod
   interactions is required both to quantify the relative importance of
   land use (grazing management) and landform (landscape physiognomy)
   across the uplands and to determine the optimal grain-size of the
   habitat mosaic to sustain biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of grazing and environment on vegetation structure have been
   widely acknowledged, but few studies have related both factors. We made
   57 floristic samples in a highly variable landscape of mountain
   grasslands in central Argentina; 26 sample were in fence-lines with
   contrasting vegetation. For each sample, we recorded topographic and
   edaphic parameters, as well as grazing intensity indicators. Floristic
   gradients were analysed with DCA and relations with abiotic and
   grazing-related variables were detected with DCCA. Floristic axis 1 was
   explained by edaphic parameters associated to topography, ranging from
   communities in well drained soils on upper topographic positions to
   hydromorphic vegetation in poorly drained soils on lower topographic
   positions. Species richness decreased as soil moisture increased.
   Floristic axis 2 was associated with present and long-term grazing
   indicators, and reflected shifts in vegetation physiognomy and species
   evenness. Tall tussock grasslands, with low species evenness and
   evidences of low or null grazing intensity were located at one extreme.
   Tussocks were gradually replaced by short graminoids and forbs towards
   the centre of the gradient, as grazing increased, and evenness reached a
   maximum. In degraded sites with heavy long-term grazing intensities,
   short perennial species were replaced by an annual species, and evenness
   decreased. The magnitude of changes in floristic composition produced by
   grazing decreased with increasing soil moisture, and
   vegetation-environment relationships were stronger in moderate to highly
   grazed situations than in lightly or non grazed situations.}},

Abstract = {{The decline of species-rich semi-natural calcareous grasslands is a
   major conservation problem throughout Europe. Maintenance of traditional
   animal husbandry is often recommended as an important management
   strategy. However, results that underpin such management recommendations
   were derived predominantly from lowland studies and may not be easily
   applicable to high mountain areas. In this study we analyse the
   importance of traditional low-intensity summer farming (cattle grazing)
   for vascular plant species diversity of a subalpine region in the
   northern calcareous Alps in Austria by resampling from an existing
   dataset on its vegetation. Results indicate a significant long term
   decline of plant species diversity following abandonment at the
   landscape scale. In contrast, within-community effects of pasture
   abandonment on plant species diversity are equivocal and strongly depend
   on the plant community. We suppose these differences to be due to diet
   preferences of cattle as well as to the differential importance of
   competition for structuring the respective communities. From our results
   we infer that the main mechanism by which pasture abandonment affects
   vascular plant species diversity, at least during the first ca. 100 yr
   documented here, are not local-scale competitive exclusion processes
   within persisting communities. Instead, post-abandonment successional
   community displacements that cause a landscape scale homogenization of
   the vegetation cover seem to be primarily responsible for a decline of
   species diversity. We conclude, that successful management of vascular
   plant species diversity in subalpine regions of the Northeastern
   Calcareous Alps will depend on the maintenance of large scale pasture
   systems with a spatially variable disturbance regime.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands in Sweden are threatened by land-use change and
   lack of management with attendant risk to their biodiversity. We present
   a model to explore the effects of grazing frequency and intensity on
   plant species persistence, and the relative effects of grassland size
   and pattern. We used a landscape modelling platform, LAMOS (LAndscape
   MOdelling Shell), to design a landscape model of vegetation dynamics
   incorporating the effects of local succession, dispersal and grazing
   disturbance. Five plant functional groups (PFG), representing various
   combinations of persistence and dispersal character, light requirements
   and disturbance responses, were defined to model species dynamics. Based
   on old cadastral maps three different landscapes were designed
   representing specific time-layers, i.e., a historical (17th to 18th
   century), a pre-modern (1940s) and a present-day landscape. Simulations
   showed that a threshold was crossed when grasslands decreased in area to
   about 10 - 30\% of the modelled area, and as a consequence the biomass
   of grassland-specific PFGs was strongly reduced. These competition
   sensitive groups did not persist in the model even with intense grazing
   in the present-day landscape, where grasslands occupy 11\% of the total
   area. However, all grassland species would have been able to persist in
   the historical landscape, where grasslands occupied 59\% of the total
   area, even without grazing. Our results suggest that continuous but
   low-intensity grazing is more positive for grassland PFGs than
   discontinuous but highly intensive grazing. This effect was particularly
   strong when the frequency and/or intensity of grazing dropped below a
   threshold of 20\%. Simulations using three landscape maps designed to
   explore effects of further fragmentation and habitat loss showed that
   the spatial pattern of remaining grasslands is important for the
   persistence of grassland-specific PFG. The model presented here is an
   advance towards more realistic grazing models to explore the effects of
   prescribed grazing and landscape fragmentation on the persistence
   species or plant functional groups.}},

Abstract = {{Species loss of primary producers is likely to affect processes on other
   trophic levels. We studied consumption and individual performance of the
   generalist herbivore Parapleurus alliaceus (Orthoptera) in relation to
   the species richness of primary producers. Adult grasshoppers were caged
   and left to feed for 2 weeks on experimental grassland communities
   ranging in plant species richness from one, two, four, eight to 32
   species. Low plant diversity had a negative effect on both plant
   community biomass and on biomass gain of female grasshoppers, feeding to
   produce eggs (male grasshoppers did not gain biomass during the feeding
   period). This was surprising because plots with high plant diversity had
   a low proportion of grass biomass and grasshoppers preferentially
   selected grasses, leading to a greater exploitation of grasses in
   experimental communities of higher diversity. Thus, the concurrent
   increase in non-grass species in the diet from these high-diversity
   communities must have been beneficial to the generalist herbivore. In
   addition to the positive effects of plant diversity, the presence of
   legumes in a mixture with grasses further enhanced the biomass gain of
   grasshoppers at a given level of diversity. These findings suggest that
   plant species loss may lead to shifts in herbivore population sizes,
   reducing those of generalists and benefiting specialists of the
   remaining plant species. Our results further suggest that generalist
   herbivores, by having feeding preferences, can also change the relative
   abundances of plant species with different functional characteristics.
   This may feedback on both composition and diversity of plant
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{A vacant niche in alpine habitats of the Krkonoge Mts. (Western Sudetes,
   Czech Republic) was colonised by a non-native butterfly Erebia epiphron
   (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae, Satyrinae) as a result of artificial
   introduction of 50 females in 1932 and 1933. The species established a
   large population occupying an entire area above the timberline on one of
   parallel ridges (East) of the mountains, but it has not yet colonised
   the parallel Western ridge, which is almost identical in area, altitude
   and vegetation. We compared altitudinal distribution and adult habitats
   of the alien species and of its native congener, E. euryale.
   Distribution of both species was significantly affected by altitude, but
   habitat type predicted butterfly numbers better than altitude in
   regression models. The introduced species was sympatric with the native
   one near the timberline, but its altitudinal optimum was higher, within
   tundra grasslands, where the native E. euryale did not occur. Peak adult
   emergence of E. euryale was later than in E. epiphron and followed
   identical pattern in allopatry. The failure of E. epiphron to colonise
   the Western ridge is attributable to its incapability to disperse across
   wooded areas. The Krkonoge alpine communities are unsaturated with
   species, which is striking in comparison with native butterfly fauna of
   lower Hruby Jesenik Mts. We interpret this by a past encroachment of
   alpine grasslands in the Krkonoge Mts. by the dwarf pine Pinus mugo. (C)

Abstract = {{The primary role of grazing animals in grassland biodiversity management
   is maintenance and enhancement of sward structural heterogeneity, and
   thus botanical and faunal diversity, by selective defoliation due to
   dietary choices, treading, nutrient cycling and propagule dispersal.
   Most research on dietary choices uses model systems that require
   considerable extrapolation to more complex communities. Grazing animals'
   diets are constrained by temporal and spatial changes in sward
   structure, plant defence mechanisms, herbage availability, plant
   phenology and animal physiological state. Potentially, these could be
   exploited to manipulate choice in diverse communities. Dietary choice
   differs between animal species, driven by factors such as body size,
   digestive physiology and dental anatomy. There is anecdotal evidence for
   breed differences but little experimentation, with genetic effects often
   confounded with background experience. There is information about
   landscape-scale breed and background effects but little about parameters
   such as bite and feeding station areas that allow reconstruction of the
   development of small-scale sward patchiness. An experiment at five
   European sites is examining breed effects on grazing behaviour,
   structural, floral and faunal diversity, animal production and economic
   impacts. In another project, calves are being reared by their own
   mothers or by cows of another breed allowing genetic effects on grazing
   behaviour to be separated from effects of early experience. `Designer
   animals' may be needed to deliver desired grazing behaviour and
   biodiversity outcomes, either by breeding or by the use of training and
   previous experience to manipulate choices. Application of research
   results requires consideration of conservation goals, whether at
   landscape, habitat, plant community or plant species level. There is a
   need to replace stocking rate prescriptions with sward-based methods and
   to integrate biodiversity goals into intensive systems. Major gaps in
   our knowledge of grazing behaviour and its impact on biodiversity
   remain, necessitating greater integration of plant ecophysiology, plant
   community ecology and animal behavioural ecology research.}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale landscape elements, such as ditch banks are an important
   remaining source of biodiversity in many agricultural landscapes,
   including the Western Peat District in the Netherlands. Unfortunately,
   plant species richness is declining even in these habitats. To
   understand the factors threatening biodiversity, we studied demographic
   traits (occupancy, trend, colonisation and extinction) for a large
   number of plant species, in a 25-year long data set. We developed a
   method to investigate the relative importance of colonisation and
   extinction for species increase and decrease in multi-species
   assemblages. We show that colonisation has been more important for
   determining species trends than extinction. Decreasing species were
   small and characterised by low nutrient tolerance and high light
   requirements, indicating that competitive. ability influences species
   trends. The mechanism by which high nutrient levels reduce plant
   diversity appears to be closely related to colonisation (germination and
   seedling establishment). Local management should therefore continue to
   focus on nutrient reduction and the creation of regeneration sites. Yet,
   these measures will be insufficient for restoring species richness since
   isolation also hampers species increase. Therefore, to maximise the
   effects of local management, additional regional management solutions
   are required to improve seed dispersal for example, from nature
   reserves. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Effects of litter and herbivores}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{652-665}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We extend the resource concentration hypothesis (herbivorous insects are
   more likely to find and stay in more dense and less diverse patches of
   their host plants) to plant communities. Specifically, whenever superior
   plant competitors spread to form dense stands, they will be found and
   attacked by their specialist insect enemies. This will decrease host
   plant abundance, causing a reduction in standing crop biomass, which
   will indirectly increase subordinate competitors and plant species
   richness. In this study, we found that a native, specialist chrysomelid
   beetle (Trirhabda virgata) in an old-field community decreased total
   standing crop biomass, leading to an increase in plant species richness.
   This reduction in biomass was due solely to a reduction in the biomass
   of the beetle's host plant, meadow goldenrod (Solidago altissima), which
   was the dominant plant species in this community. Our results
   demonstrate that when a superior competitor increases in density, the
   per-stem impact of herbivores increases due to a buildup of these
   herbivores in high-density host patches. Specifically, we found that as
   goldenrod density increased, the per-stem abundance of Trirhabda virgata
   also increased. In turn, species richness increased as the negative
   effect of insects on goldenrod biomass increased.
   Recent research suggests that litter accumulation could negate or cancel
   the effect of herbivorous insects on plant communities because litter
   accumulation increases with standing crop biomass, causing a decline in
   species richness. The litter accumulation hypothesis states that, in
   productive communities, the increase in the abundance of the superior
   competitor will lead to a dense accumulation of plant litter, causing a
   decline in species richness. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found
   that as the biomass of the dominant plant species increased, litter mass
   also increased. In turn, species richness decreased as the negative
   effects of litter on stem density increased. Interestingly, the effect
   of litter on stem density depended on whether insects were present. Our
   results suggest the potential for a general rule: specialist insect
   herbivores will function as classic keystone species in plant
   communities whenever host species form large, dense aggregations if host
   plants are dominant species.}},

Abstract = {{A habitat monitoring programme, the Northern Ireland Countryside Survey,
   carried out by the University of Ulster for the Department of the
   Environment for Northern Ireland, is described. It was based on a random
   sample of quarter kilometer grid squares, stratified by multivariate
   land classification. Estimates of change in habitat area between
   1987-1992 and 1998 are presented and used to assess policy-related
   priorities for biodiversity conservation action in widespread habitats
   in Northern Ireland (NI). The basis of the assessment is Broad Habitats,
   a classification developed as part of the United Kingdom (UK)
   Biodiversity Action Plan. Improved Grassland, Neutral Grassland and Bog
   Broad Habitats occupy the largest area of NI, which holds a large
   proportion of the UK Neutral Grassland and Fen Marsh and Swamp Broad
   Habitat resource. The greatest net area increases with time were in
   Improved Grassland (33\%), Coniferous Woodland (12\%) and Broadleaved,
   Mixed and Yew Woodland (9\%). The greatest net area decreases were in
   Neutral Grassland (-32\%), Arable and Horticulture (-25\%), Fen, Marsh
   and Swamp (-19\%), Bog (-8\%) and Calcareous Grassland (-7\%). These
   changes are a function of agriculture, public and private forestry,
   building construction and peat cutting for fuel. The Key biodiversity
   issue is seminatural Broad Habitat loss, in particular, Neutral
   Grassland and Fen, Marsh and Swamp, highlighting the lack of effective
   action for protecting biodiversity in the countryside as a whole. The
   extent to which current land use is shown to be driving change,
   indicates that biodiversity conservation action through implementing
   landscape-scale agri-environment measures could deliver major
   biodiversity gains. The reliable information on recent changes, provided
   by the Northern Ireland Countryside Survey, has been used to guide
   conservation planning. Future re-survey will allow the effectiveness of
   the conservation strategy as it applies to the countryside as a whole,
   to be determined. As decisions on land use increasingly have a strong
   European dimension, concerted action for protecting biodiversity in the
   countryside as a whole is needed. This would be promoted by a structured
   sampling approach, based on standard habitat mapping procedures. (C)

   the line intercept method, and stem density was estimated in 25-x 1.5-m
   plots. Species richness did not differ among treatments. Percent woody
   plant cover was reduced by 50 and 41\% on winter and winter-summer
   combination burned sites, respectively. Honey mesquite (Prosopis
   glandulosa Torr.), twisted acacia (Acacia schaffneri S. Wats.), Texas
   persimmon (Diospyros texana Scheele), lotebush {[}Ziziphus obtusifolia
   (Hook.) T.\&G.], wolfberry (Lycium berlandieri Dunal), and tasajillo
   (Opuntia leptocaulis Cand.) canopy cover was greatest on nontreated
   sites. Woody plant density declined by 29 and 23\% on winter and
   winter-summer combination burned sites, respectively. Density of
   guayacan (Guajacum angustifolium Engelm.), wolfberry, and tasajillo was
   less on all burning treatments. Percent cover of spiny hackberry (Celtis
   pallida Torr.) and density of Texas pricklypear (Opuntia engelmannii
   Salm-Reif.-Dyck) declined on winter burned sites. Inclusion of summer
   fire into the burning regime did not increase declines in woody plants.
   Fire created a post-fire environment which resulted in the decline of
   many woody plant species. It is unclear to what degree other
   environmental factors such as herbivory and competition between woody
   plants and among woody and herbaceous vegetation may have interacted
   with fire in producing woody plant declines. Fire may be a useful tool
   in managing woody vegetation on native south Texas rangelands, while
   maintaining woody plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional perception of how tallgrass prairie responds to fire at
   times other than late spring is either anecdotal or extrapolated from
   studies that lack spatial or temporal variability. Therefore, we
   evaluated patterns of change in vegetation cover, species richness,
   diversity, and aboveground biomass production on 2 different topographic
   positions from ungrazed watersheds that were burned annually for 8 years
   in either autumn (November), winter (February), or spring (April).
   Topoedaphic factors influenced the response patterns of some species to
   seasonal fire, although differences were primarily in the rate of
   change. Annual burning in autumn and winter produced similar trends
   through time for most species. Big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii Vitman)
   cover increased with all burn regimes, whereas indiangrass
   {[}Sorghastrum nutans (L.) Nash] increased only with spring burning.
   Repeated autumn and winter burning eventually increased perennial forb
   cover, with the largest increases occurring in heath aster
   {[}Symphyotrichum ericoides (L.) Nesom], aromatic aster {[}S.
   oblognifolium (Nutt.) Nesom], tall goldenrod (Solidago canadensis L.),
   and legumes. Species richness increased (P<0.001) through time with
   spring and winter burning, but was similar among all burn treatments
   after 8 years of annual fire. Average grass and forb biomass did not
   differ among burn seasons on either topographic position, although
   interannual biomass production fluctuated inconsistently with time of
   burn. Our findings contrast with many of the conventional views of how
   tallgrass prairie vegetation responds to seasonal fire and challenges
   traditional recommendations that burning should only occur in late
   spring.}},

Abstract = {{Pikas (Ochotona spp.) are burrowing herbivorous mammals believed to play
   a keystone role in determining the biodiversity of steppe ecosystems.
   Impacts of domestic livestock grazing on the distribution and abundance
   of the Daurian pika Ochotona daurica were investigated in eastern
   Mongolia where the species is widespread and abundant. Effects of pikas
   on plant species richness and vegetation coverage were examined at
   different distances from burrow systems. Daurian pikas were nearly
   absent from severely grazed study sites, and incidence of the species
   increased with decreasing grazing intensity. The number of occupied
   burrow systems and usage of burrows was higher in sites with lower
   grazing pressure. Plant species richness and ground cover was higher at
   3-12 m from the burrow systems than directly over burrows, suggesting
   that the effect of Daurian pikas is limited to the burrow system.
   Contradictory to previous studies on grassland pikas, this study
   indicates that Daurian pikas suffer from overgrazing and that their
   impact on grassland is only light.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the paper is to evaluate the feasibility and constraints of
   organic farming to increase the sustainability of Mediterranean small
   ruminant livestock systems. The paper analyzes the factors affecting
   sustainability of small ruminant livestock systems in the Mediterranean
   basin, such as seasonal forage availability or suboptimal pasture
   utilisation due to overgrazing but also the factor of undergrazing. The
   paper considers how the application of practices of organic farming may
   contribute to promoting sustainable land use and improving environment
   conservation, animal welfare, and product quality. Also the prospects of
   new information-based technologies, like geographic information systems
   and global positioning systems, to improve sustainability are presented.
   A model of pasture-based dairy sheep production system is proposed, with
   special emphasis on the organisation of a farm forage system to meet
   animal nutritional requirement. Some options for an integrated strategy
   for the control of parasitic disease in small ruminant production
   systems are discussed. These are based on a combination of general
   prevention methods (i.e. risk control and identification), grazing
   management (i.e. multifunctional grassland management), nonchemical
   treatments (i.e. homeopathic herbal preparations) and novel approaches
   (i.e. biological control and bioactive forages). Comparative effects of
   phytotherapy and conventional treatment on dairy sheep helminthic
   disease and on metabolic status and animal welfare are presented.
   The prospects of organic farming are of particular interest for the less
   favoured Mediterranean areas, where it may contribute to the safeguard
   of agricultural functions, like care and preservation of landscape, and
   safeguarding of rural villages with positive effects on the quality of
   life in rural communities. Some activities would be particularly
   appropriate in natural parks, where small ruminants and other domestic
   animals interact with wildlife and where biodiversity must be preserved.
   For positive results a new collaborative decision-making process is
   required between rural and urban communities, businesses and government.
   In addition, strong supports from scientific research and the extension
   services are needed to correct and fully utilize new information
   technologies to exploit the magnitude and potential of organic farming
   for enhancement of sustainable small ruminant production systems in the
   Mediterranean region. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that at higher trophic levels species are especially
   vulnerable to habitat fragmentation due to small population size and
   dependence on particular prey species. Using aphids as model organism,
   we tested the hypothesis that herbivore abundance increases in
   fragmented habitats Lis a result Of reduced predator and parasitoid
   densities. In a 3 year-study, we examined the population dynamics of
   aphids with respect to host plant abundance and ant nest density in
   experimentally fragmented calcareous grasslands at two sites in the
   northern Jura mountains. Fragments of different size (area: 20.25 m(2).
   2.25 m(2) and 0.25 m(2)) were isolated by a 5 in wide strip of
   frequently mown vegetation and corresponding control plots were situated
   in the adjacent undisturbed grassland. Aphid density was higher in
   fragments than in control plots. This was a combined result of a higher
   frequency of aphid-infested plants and larger aphid colonies in
   fragments than in control plots. Furthermore, a larger proportion of
   aphid colonies was ant-attended in fragments than in control plots.
   Aphid colonies were also more frequently visited by ants in fragments
   than in control plots in one of the 3 years. Parasitoid pressure on
   aphids was not influenced by the experimental fragmentation. Neither
   were aphid species richness and diversity affected by the fragmentation.
   Our study shows that even small-scale habitat fragmentation can have
   profound effects on the abundance of herbivorous insects. The effect on
   aphid density was consistent over 3 years and two sites with slightly
   different aphid communities.}},

Abstract = {{Two blocks, each consisting of twelve 0.25 m(2) permanent plots, were
   established in a community dominated by desert annuals in an area of
   Kuwait protected from grazing, and community attributes were
   investigated over three growth seasons. A linear relationship was found
   between estimated desert annual cover and biomass production. Species
   frequency was assessed by the number of 100 cm(2) subplots occupied by a
   species in a block ({''}block incidence{''}). Over the three seasons,
   vegetation features varied considerably. The first season (spring 1997)
   was characterised by very sparse vegetation cover, low vegetation block
   incidence (sum of individual block incidences of each species present in
   a block) and low species richness. The second season (spring 1998) had
   high vegetation cover, relatively low vegetation block incidence, but
   high species richness. In the third season ( spring 2000), vegetation
   cover was very sparse ( as in 1997), but both blocks had the highest
   vegetation block incidence of the three years and species richness was
   moderately high, although individual plants were very small. The growth
   period was much shorter in the very productive and species-rich 1998
   season than in 2000. Fluctuations in biomass and species incidence
   coincided with pronounced variation in key meteorological variables, in
   particular the onset of the first rains, the amount of rainfall during
   the growing season and its temporal distribution. Species composition,
   however, appears mainly to be determined by the amount and possibly the
   timing of the first rainfalls of the season to trigger germination.
   There was little evidence to suggest that particularly favourable or
   unfavourable microsites existed in plots for more than one vegetation
   period, either for individual species or for diversity in general.
   Despite substantial between-season fluctuations in incidence, the
   relative abundances of the more frequent species to each other remained
   broadly similar over the three seasons, with Plantago boissieri being
   the predominant species and accounting for the largest proportion of
   biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable controversy has arisen over the management of white-tailed
   deer in eastern landscapes where there is evidence of damage to forest
   vegetation, crops, and wildlife habitat attributable to deer. We
   examined the impact of 4, 8, 15, and 25 deer/km(2) on herbaceous layer
   abundance and tree seedling density, height development, species
   composition, and diversity for 10 yr in a repeated-measures
   randomized-complete-block experiment at four replicate cherry-maple
   forest sites in northwestern Pennsylvania, USA. At each 65-ha site, deer
   were placed in 13- or 26-ha fenced enclosures in which the landscape
   composition and forage production of a forest managed on a 100-yr
   rotation was simulated by clear-cutting 10\% of each area and thinning
   30\% Vegetation was sampled 0-1, 3, 5, and 10 yr after treatment (YAT).
   We analyzed vegetative treatment responses separately in each
   silvicultural treatment.
   Time, was an important factor mediating responses at all deer densities.
   Rubus spp. abundance in all silvicultural treatments and the density of
   striped maple (STM) in clearcuts and birch (131), American beech (AB),
   and red maple (RM) in thinnings showed negative trends with increasing
   deer density. As deer density increased, we found negative linear trends
   in the height of 131, RM, and AB in clearcuts; in the height of AB, RM,
   and STM in thinnings; and in the height of AB. and RM in uncut stands.
   Species richness showed a negative linear trend with increasing deer
   density in all silvicultural treatments.
   Conversely, species avoided by deer or resilient to deer browsing
   increased with increasing deer density. Percent cover of ferns, grasses,
   and sedges showed positive, linear trends with deer density in clearcuts
   and in thinnings. The percentage of plots dominated by black cherry (BC)
   increased with increasing deer density in cut and uncut stands. The net
   result of increased deer impact was an altered trajectory of vegetation
   development dominated by species avoided by deer or resilient to
   deer,browsing.
   Negative effects on vegetation became significant at deer impact levels
   well below those observed in many eastern forests. Moreover, species not
   browsed or resilient to browsing may have indirect effects on vegetation
   development through plant-plant interactions and on wildlife habitat,
   quality for small mammals, birds, and deer. Managing these impacts is
   important as pressures to harvest and fragment eastern forests
   accelerate.}},

Abstract = {{1. Associational refuges - reduced herbivory on plants in presence of
   other plant species - may be caused by general and species-specific
   plant characteristics. However, the species specificity of associational
   refuges has rarely been evaluated.
   2. This study examined the species specificity of one known example of
   associational refuges, the forb Lythrum salicaria and the monophagous
   insect herbivores Galerucella calmariensis, G. pusilla and Nanophyes
   marmoratus. The underlying mechanism was examined in order to evaluate
   connections between mechanisms and species specificity.
   3. Laboratory studies showed that N . marmoratus but not Galerucella
   individuals were attracted by odour from undamaged host plants, and that
   neither species was distracted by odour from Myrica gale .
   4. Field experiments showed that three non-host plant neighbours with an
   appearance similar to M. gale, and artificial shrubs, reduced the
   abundance and egg-laying of Galerucella species by 70-90\%. The
   abundance of N. marmoratus was increased 18-fold on plants in thickets
   compared with outside.
   5. The different responses by N . marmoratus and the Galerucella species
   to plant neighbours appear to be because N. marmoratus, but not
   Galerucella, uses olfactory information in the initial host-finding
   process.}},

Title = {{Soil microbial community, fertility, vegetation and diversity as targets
   in the restoration management of a meadow grassland}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{51-64}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. The enhancement of biodiversity in meadow grassland, an environmental
   aim of European agricultural policy, requires definition of appropriate
   management regimes and the rate at which they enhance biodiversity and
   change ecosystem properties. We describe vegetation changes in a 10-year
   trial on mesotrophic grassland that was previously agriculturally
   improved, plus change in the soil microbial community and fertility,
   important factors that influence biodiversity.
   2. Management treatments were three hay-cut dates, plus two mineral
   fertilizer, two seed addition and two farmyard manure (FYM)
   applications. Treatment combinations included the traditional management
   regime (21 July hay-cut date, no mineral fertilizer, autumn grazing with
   cattle, spring grazing with sheep), modern variants of this (14 June
   hay-cut date, mineral fertilizer) and exceptional historic variants (1
   September hay-cut date).
   3. Sowing seed increased species richness and, in the absence of
   fertilizer and FYM, produced a plant community similar to Geranium
   sylvaticum-Anthoxanthum odouratum grassland. The greatest cover of sown
   species was found in seeded treatments, cut for hay on 21 July, in the
   absence of mineral fertilizer. The target plant community (MG3b
   grassland) was most rapidly achieved with a 21 July hay cut. Initial
   decrease in Ellenberg fertility scores only persisted in the 21 July and
   1 September cut dates when mineral fertilizer was absent. Soil phosphate
   was lowest in the joint absence of mineral fertilizer and FYM.
   4. There were few treatment effects on the soil microflora. Bacterial
   biomass was reduced when FYM was applied with the 14 June cut date, but
   increased when FYM was applied with the 1 September cut date. Fungal
   biomass decreased when mineral fertilizer was applied.
   5. Increased species richness, primarily through an increase in legumes,
   stress-tolerant and stress-tolerant ruderal plant strategists, was
   associated with an increase in soil fungi and the abundance of fungi
   relative to bacteria. All these were associated with seed addition to
   unfertilized plots cut on 21 July, in the absence of FYM, indicating a
   functional role for individual species.
   6. Synthesis and applications. The enhancement of biodiversity in meadow
   grassland is a long-term (< 10-year) secondary succession, most rapidly
   achieved in the absence of mineral fertilizer by cutting for hay in
   mid-July and autumn grazing with cattle. The sowing of key functional
   species, i.e. legumes and Rhinanthus minor, was important in
   facilitating the staged colonization of other sown species.}},

Abstract = {{A regional vegetation survey of the temperate grassy woodlands
   (temperate savanna) in Australia was designed to assess the effects of
   clearing and grazing on the composition of vegetation remnants and the
   adjacent pasture matrix. Vegetation was sampled across a range of
   habitats using 77 0.1024-ha quadrats; the relative abundance of species
   was recorded. Classification analysis clustered the sites into three
   main groups that corresponded to intensity of grazing/clearing followed
   by groups based on underlying lithology (basalt, metasediment,
   granites). Using Canonical Correspondence Analysis, exogenous
   disturbance and environmental variables were related to the relative
   abundance of species; grazing intensity had the highest eigenvalue
   (0.27) followed by tree canopy cover (0.25), lithology (0. 18), altitude
   (0.17) and slope (0.10). Based on two-dimensional ordination scores, six
   species response groups were defined relating to intensity of
   pastoralism and nutrient status of the landscape. Abundance and
   dominance of native shrubs, subshrubs, twiners and geophytes were
   strongly associated with areas of less-intense pastoralism on
   low-nutrient soils. The strongest effects on species richness were
   grazing followed by canopy cover. Continuously grazed sites had lower
   native species richness across all growth forms except native grasses.
   There was no indication that intermediate grazing intensities enhanced
   forb richness as a result of competitive release. Species richness for
   all native plants was lowest where trees were absent especially under
   grazed conditions. Canopy cover in ungrazed sites appeared to promote
   the co-existence of shrubs with the herbaceous layer. Predicted declines
   in forb richness in treeless, ungrazed, sites were not detected. The
   lack of a disturbance- mediated enhancement of the herbaceous layer was
   attributed to habitat heterogeneity at 0. 1 ha sampling scale.}},

Volume = {{72}},

Abstract = {{The calcareous grasslands belong to the species-rich plant communities
   in Poland. Most of them are of anthropogenic origin and they need
   specific management (i.e. periodical cutting suckers of trees and
   shrubs, grazing or mowing) in order to protect their floristic
   diversity. Many of calcareous grasslands have been overgrown by shrubs
   as a result of cessation of traditional management. The aim of this
   study was to compare the structure and dynamics of xerothermic hazel
   shrub patches, which were undergoing secondary succession with patches
   where different management practices aiming at restoration of
   species-rich limestone grassland were applied. The managed plots had a
   significantly higher species richness than the control one. However,
   they strongly differed in their floristic composition from
   well-preserved limestone grasslands. There were also significant
   differences observed between both the managed plots. Too intensive
   management, particularly frequent mowing of herbs resulted in expansion
   of grass species such as Brachypodium pinnatum and Calamagrostis
   arundinacea and caused a sharp decline in species richness.
   The species composition and turnover rate strongly depended on
   succesional stage (soil layer thickness) of plots at the start of the
   experiment. The deeper was the soil, the higher was the rate of species
   turnover and the smaller was the share of xerothermic and thermophilous
   species. The last mentioned group was dominated by species with a
   persistent seed bank in the soil, frequently colonizing anthropogenic
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Mowing and grazing are often used as alternative methods of grassland

   particular, reduced the abundance of dry grassland species (6/13).
   Simultaneously both forest species (10/1) and overgrowth species (7/0)
   increased. During the grazing period, species turnover was lower and the
   growth of T. medium was reduced (6/8), but the invasion of clovers was

   Grazing Systems (SGS) National Experiment from the initial call for
   expressions of interest, through several workshop processes to the final

   western Victoria, north-east Victoria, and on the Central Tablelands,
   North West Slopes, and the eastern Riverina of New South Wales. Sites in
   Western Australia, north-east Victoria, the North West Slopes, and the
   eastern Riverina also had subsites. Methods for the sites and subsites
   (data collection for pastures, livestock, weather, soils and site
   characterisation) are presented to provide a central reference, and to
   save duplication in subsequent papers. Descriptions are provided of the
   location, average annual rainfall, major pasture, soil and stock types,
   design and number of treatments, and initial soil levels (0-10 cm) of
   phosphorus, electrical conductivity, and pH for sites and subsites. Also
   outlined is the major focus of the research undertaken at each site.
   While sites studied regionally relevant issues, they operated under a
   common protocol for data collection with a minimum data set being
   specified for each of 5 unifying themes: pastures, animal production,
   water, nutrients, and biodiversity. Economic analyses were also
   undertaken at the macro- and micro-level, and a procedural tool
   developed for appraising the on- and off-farm impacts of different
   systems. To give effect to the themes, common database and modelling
   tools were developed specifically for the national experiment, so that
   collectively sites comprised a single experiment.}},

Abstract = {{The relationships between productivity and plant species diversity were
   assessed using data from the Sustainable Grazing Systems (SGS) 10
   national experiment sites. Each site applied up to 7 different
   management treatments. Sites varied in the amount of data available for
   analysis. Plant species diversity was assessed in terms of both the
   total and native species present at each site. More than 200 plant taxa
   were recorded over the period of the experiment, about one-third of
   which were native. In the majority of cases, the native species present
   within a treatment remained there throughout the experiments, even when
   fertilised and oversown with introduced species. The number of native
   species increased by 1 or 2 over the 3 - 4 years of each experiment
   where grasslands were less intensively used ( average herbage mass > 2 t
   DM/ha), but decreased in more heavily grazed treatments. Native grasses
   made much greater contributions to herbage mass than other native
   species. Of the more than 70 native plant species found, the most
   numerous were broadleaf species, which tended to be more variable under
   management treatments. As total species richness increased, there was a
   tendency for pasture productivity to be less, for the mean standing
   herbage mass to be less and for seasonal growth to be less stable. This
   depended upon experiments and tended to apply at the sites with higher
   annual pasture growth rates. All treatments had > 10 plant species
   within the small ( about 1.5 ha) paddocks used and larger paddocks often
   had many more. It was apparent from the high plant species richness at
   each site ( about 25 - 100 species) that many more niches exist in these
   paddocks than the number of species usually sown in a pasture.
   Opportunities to redesign pasture mixtures to exploit more of the
   resources available obviously exist. Understanding of the relationships
   among management practices, productivity and plant species diversity is
   limited, but will become important as we seek more sustainable grazing
   systems. The studies analysed here suggested that where the herbage mass
   was maintained between 2 and 4 t DM/ha then species were maintained and
   productivity was optimised.}},

Abstract = {{Carabids (Carabidae, Coleoptera) were studied for 2 years to explore
   changes in their diversity and composition during a forestry cycle in
   the Hungarian Mountain Range. Native beech forest was clear-cut and
   replanted with Norway spruce. Recently planted (5 years old), young (15
   years old), middle-aged (30 years old) and old spruce plantations (50
   years old) were studied using pitfall traps. Our results showed that the
   species richness of carabids was significantly lower in the plantations
   than in the native beech forest. Species composition was homogeneous in
   the beech forest. beta-Diversity of the 15-30 year old plantations was
   also low, and it increased slightly towards ageing. Heterogeneity of the
   species composition of the 5 year old plantation was higher than that of
   the others, which reflected the patchiness of the young plantation. The
   main tendencies of the compositional changes were as follows. Deciduous
   forest specialists decreased significantly in abundance in the
   plantations; they appeared in high abundance only in the beech forest.
   Species characteristic of open habitats increased remarkably in
   abundance in the recently established plantation. Multiple linear
   regression between the diversity of carabids and of 12 environmental
   variables shows that the pH and compaction of the soil, and the cover of
   leaf litter had a significant effect in determining diversity of
   carabids.}},

Abstract = {{Variation in species and trophic composition of litter insects during
   plant secondary succession was documented in four chronosequences of
   secondary forests. Each sequence included three sites abandoned 5, 30
   and over 60 yr ago. At each site and in each census, we sampled four 30
   cm x 30 cm samples of litter placed in Berlese funnels. In the 5 yr
   sites, litter mass was below 500 g/m(2), while in the 30 yr and over 60
   yr sites litter mass varied between 400 to 1000 g/m(2). Richness of
   litter insects was 7 to 10 morphospecies in the 5 yr sites, 15 to 21 in
   the 30 yr sites, and 18 to 26 in the over 60 yr sites. There was a
   positive relationship between litter mass and the species richness of
   litter insects. Species composition of litter insects in the 5 yr sites
   was significantly different compared with the 30 yr and over 60 yr
   sites. This difference was due to 9 unique morphospecies in the 5 yr
   sites and 13 morphospecies shared between the 30 yr and over 60 yr
   sites. These data suggest that the 30 yr and the over 60 yr sites have
   similar resources and microhabitats that promoted a similar species
   composition. Trophic composition was similar among successional stages;
   detritivores, omnivores, and chewing and sucking herbivores were common
   to virtually all sites. We conclude that trophic composition of litter
   insects recovered faster than species composition during secondary
   succession.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in ecological concepts and a new focus on biodiversity as a
   central objective have led to changes in fire policies in South African
   savanna parks. Prescribed burning using fixed fire intervals is being
   replaced by systems that promote more variable fire regimes and greater
   management flexibility. Three policy alternatives have been proposed for
   Kruger National Park: a lightning fire policy, patch mosaic burning, and
   burning based on ecological criteria. There is no agreement as yet on
   which policy to adopt. However there is growing consensus on the use of
   a management system using `thresholds of potential concern' to evaluate
   the outcome of different policies. These thresholds have been
   established for numerous indicators, help focus monitoring activities,
   and guide managers on the need for active intervention. We discuss the
   applicability of the policy alternatives for preventing successional
   change from savanna to forest and promoting grazing lawns and their
   associated grazers. We conclude that none of the current policies is
   universally applicable. A prescriptive program of frequent, high
   intensity burns will be required in mesic savannas to prevent succession
   to forests. In arid savannas, fire regimes designed to promote variable
   fire frequencies and fire sizes would be preferred to maintain greater
   diversity of grassland swards and grazer communities. The lessons
   learned from fire policy debates in South African savannas are of wider
   relevance for managing conservation areas elsewhere.}},

Title = {{Sustainable management of Swedish seminatural pastures with high species
   diversity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{117-125}},
Abstract = {{Historically, semi-natural pastures were important for Sweden's food
   supply but this importance, and the area grazed, decreased strongly
   during the 20th century. Remaining areas are of major importance for
   nature conservancy today on account of their high biodiversity and
   cultural values. Consequently, a national goal is to ensure that those
   areas still grazed are also grazed in the future and that grazing is
   expanded to include particularly important seminatural pastures where
   grazing has ceased. The aim of this paper is to consider scenarios under
   which economically sustainable grazing of species-rich semi-natural
   pastures can be achieved. These scenarios are informed both by
   agricultural statistics describing trends in livestock availability in
   Sweden and by interviews with a sample of farmers who manage valuable
   pastures. The statistics show a rapid decrease in number of herds and a
   slightly reduced number of grazing animals. Three scenarios are
   considered: 1, continued grazing on existing farms with the farmer's own
   animals; 2, nature conservancy entrepreneurs who move grazing animals
   around on otherwise ungrazed pastures, and 3, creating large areas of
   pasture-forest mosaics from existing and previously abandoned pastures
   and marginal arable land, thereby enabling a combination of nature
   conservancy and cost-efficient meat production. The interviews reveal
   that it would be unrealistic to expect scenario 1 alone to fulfil the
   conservation goal, especially in forest-dominated regions characterised
   by a high proportion of elderly farmers with small herds. Development of
   new enterprises, according to scenarios 2 and 3, is therefore an
   essential complement to the present EU environmental allowances if the
   cost of preserving grazing-dependent biodiversity is not to increase
   massively in the future.}},

   Kenya: A test of equilibrium and non-equilibrium hypotheses}},
Journal = {{LAND DEGRADATION \& DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{This study employs scale-dependence as an analytical approach to
   understanding effects of livestock grazing on rangeland degradation in
   northern Kenya. It used extensive datasets previously collected from
   13200 km(2) rangelands where grazing pressure gradients of livestock
   (varied from none, light, moderate, heavy and very heavy grazing) in
   conjunction with seasonality across different ecological scales
   influenced plant responses and probably contributed to land degradation.
   The data representing spatial and temporal scales were used to test the
   equilibrium and non-equilibrium-grazing models and to verify scales at
   which the models appropriately described range degradation. The
   equilibrium-grazing models operated at the coarse scales (e.g. range
   units, km(2)) and non-equilibrium-grazing models at multiple scales
   (e.g. spatial, temporal and fine scales - plots, landscape patches). The
   study showed that the equilibrium-grazing hypothesis, which stated that
   responses of plant species richness, cover and biomass varied along
   grazing pressure gradients at the coarse scale, was rejected, while the
   nonequilibrium-grazing hypothesis, which stated that the factors
   responded to temporal and spatial scales combined with grazing pressure
   gradients at the fine scale, was accepted. This study emphasized that in
   future discussions on shifts in the thinking of range science from
   equilibrium- to non-equilibrium-grazing models should clarify scales at
   which land degradation is assessed. In conclusion, the paper suggests
   that understanding plant species responses to grazing pressure and
   seasonality needs to consider multiple scale effects and that the
   dogmatic notions about degradation of the and zone rangelands at the
   coarse scales should be reconsidered. Land degradation assessments in
   the and zones should focus at the fine scale. Copyright (C) 2002 John

Journal = {{NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{27}},

Pages = {{179-189}},
Abstract = {{In a Festuca novae-zelandiae short tussock grassland in South Island,
   New Zealand, we tested the propositions (1) that present regional trends
   in vascular plant species-richness in tussock grasslands are independent
   of current pastoral management, and (2) that grazing retards the
   invasion and dominance of non-native species, particularly where soil
   resources are not limiting. Sheep and rabbit-grazed, ungrazed,
   ungrazed+fertilised and ungrazed+irrigated treatments were applied in a
   replicated experiment that was sampled annually from 1988 to 2000.
   Native species richness and native forb cover decreased, and exotic
   grasses increased in all treatments, with no significant differences
   between grazed and ungrazed treatments in either trends or final cover.
   Exotic species richness decreased in the ungrazed, ungrazed+fertilised
   and ungrazed+irrigated treatments but showed no trend in grazed
   vegetation. Cover of native tussock grasses and the tall shrub
   Carmichaelia petriei decreased in the grazed treatment, remained steady
   in the ungrazed treatment and increased in the ungrazed+fertilised and
   ungrazed+irrigated treatments. Native subshrubs decreased in the grazed,
   ungrazed+fertilised and ungrazed+irrigated treatments but not in the
   ungrazed treatment. The invasive forb Hieracium pilosella increased with
   time in grazed, ungrazed, and ungrazed+irrigated treatments, but after
   10 years it decreased in the ungrazed+fertilised treatment and its cover
   was negligible there after 12 years. Grazing appeared to reduce the
   cover of tussocks and certain woody species, and we conclude that
   current management affected vegetation trends. Grazing did not decrease
   the dominance of exotic species, or maintain native species richness at
   a higher level than in ungrazed vegetation. There was limited recovery
   of taller native species with grazing removal alone. However, grazing
   removal plus 12 years of resource enrichment promoted the growth of
   native tall shrubs and tussocks and did not result in physiognomic
   dominance by exotic species. Succession towards taller native
   tussock-shrubland communities may be an appropriate goal for
   conservation management of short tussock grasslands, and nutrient
   enrichment in the absence of grazing may be an appropriate management
   device in some circumstances.}},

Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{The tropical Far East has many outcrops of ultramafic rock including
   very large areas in Sulawesi (c. 8000 km(2)) and New Caledonia (c. 5500
   km(2)). The outcrops occur under several different climates, and give
   rise to a range of soils, the characteristics of which are reviewed. The
   vegetation on them is very varied. Under the same climate one can find
   grassland, scrub, and both short and tall rain forests. The variation in
   species richness on the ultramafics is difficult to explain. The degree
   of endemism varies too; it is probably less dependent on soil
   characteristics than on historical factors. The causes of the various
   unusual types of vegetation on ultramafic outcrops are discussed. It is
   possible that the somewhat dwarfed forests result from a shortage of one
   or more major nutrients or from very high soil Mg/Ca quotients or high
   Ni concentrations. The distinct `maquis' vegetation of New Caledonia,
   and probably ultramafic scrub elsewhere, has evolved in relation to not
   only the soil chemical factors just listed but also periodic fire and
   varying degrees of drought. Fires are certainly more important than was
   once thought and the adverse soil factors may have a role in delaying
   recolonisation. The plant chemistry is notable for the presence of
   species which hyper-accumulate certain elements, notably Ni. This
   phenomenon is discussed in relation to its ecological importance, which
   may be protection of the hyperaccumulators against herbivores. The need
   for a conservation policy for the ultramafic areas is stressed, and
   mention is made of the restoration work on sites damaged by nickel
   mining in New Caledonia.}},

   community under different grazing and irrigation regimes}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2003}},
Volume = {{169}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{227-243}},
Abstract = {{A factorial field experiment was used to assess the influence of
   soil-disturber mammals in the structure of a 9-year-old Mediterranean
   annual plant community subjected to different sheep grazing and
   irrigation regimes. We estimated the disturbance rate ( mound building
   activity) by Mediterranean voles, their effects on vegetation and the
   mechanisms of these effects during a period of vole outbreak. The
   effects on vegetation were analysed at the levels of species, functional
   groups and plant community. Disturbance rate was high and voles can
   disturb the entire soil surface once every four or five years. The
   availability of certain trophic resources ( perennial plants) appeared
   to drive vole expansion in the experimental plots and it was independent
   of the irrigation and grazing treatments. Mound building activities
   largely affected vegetation but conserved plot differences. Total
   vegetation cover, absolute cover of all functional groups, mean
   vegetation height and species richness were less on mounds than on
   undisturbed ground. These effects did not change the relative abundance
   of annuals, perennials, grasses and forbs. Only the relative abundance
   of small-seeded species decreased on mounds. As the proportion of these
   seeds was similar in both types of patches, we suggest that small-seeded
   species had more difficulties for germinating or emerging when they are
   buried during mound formation. Irrigation and sheep grazing promoted
   large changes in the vegetation parameters but these effects were, in
   general, similar on mounds and undisturbed ground. Our results show that
   the availability of germinable seeds may be the major limitation for
   mound revegetation, probably due to the scarcity of seeds existing at
   the depths from which soils are excavated. Our results also suggested a
   resource limitation on mounds. The results provide additional evidence
   that soil disturbances by small herbivore mammals exert relevant
   ecological effects on abandoned Mediterranean croplands. We discuss the
   ecological implications of vole mound-building activities for plant
   succession, plant species conservation and forage resource availability
   for livestock.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance and variety of seedlings in Baltic coastal grasslands was
   studied in cattle grazed and ungrazed areas in seashore and delta on the
   western coast of Finland. The vegetation, seed bank and environmental
   conditions of the same sites were also studied. Altogether 4609
   seedlings were observed in 79 field plots (20 cm x 20 cm) making an
   average of 1458.54 seedlings/m(2). The majority of the seedlings were
   dicots (67.5\%) and perennials (96.8\%). Altogether 44 species and an
   average of 4.14 species per plot were identified as seedlings. The most
   abundant taxon, Carex formed 23.2\% of all the seedlings observed in the
   field. In the delta the seedling density was two times that found at the
   seashore. Also, the numbers of species of seedlings per plot were
   significantly higher in the delta than in the seashore, but in total,
   more species germinated from the seashore than from the delta even
   though the number of plots was higher in the delta (n = 51) than in the
   seashore (n = 28). The numbers of species and seedlings per plot were
   smaller in grazed sites than in ungrazed ones similar to the pattern
   earlier reported concerning the mature vegetation and seed bank. The
   mean numbers of seedlings were the highest at lower geolittoral plots
   (about 20 cm elevation), where the seed bank was also densest. About
   60.0\% of the mature species in the plots were also detected as
   seedlings and 91.4\% of the seedling species were found in the mature
   vegetation of the plots. The number of seedlings was positively
   correlated with the cover of mature vegetation giving support to the
   nurse effect theory. Seedling numbers were negatively correlated with
   the abundance of litter indicating that litter restricts germination
   because it is a mechanical barrier but also decreases the amount of
   light. The number of seedlings and species, both in total and per unit
   area, were greater in the seed bank than in the field seedling
   population. The seedling population was more similar to the mature

Abstract = {{To evaluate the effects of nitrogen, disturbance, mowing and boundary
   width on the composition of plant communities of field boundaries a
   spatial plant competition model was developed that incorporates
   competition for nitrogen and light as well as mineralisation and
   population dynamical processes. The model was parameterised for four
   grassland species: Poa annua, Holcus lanatus, Anthoxanthum odoratum and
   Festuca ovina. To test the model, simulation results were compared with
   data from a pot and a field experiment. In addition, several long-term
   simulations were performed to analyse the effect of the various factors
   on field boundary composition.
   The results of the simulations were generally in agreement with
   experimental results. The simulation study indicated that perennial
   diversity was maximal when nutrient input and degree of disturbance were
   low, cuttings removed and the boundary wide. The simulations and
   experimental results indicated that to enhance diversity of the field
   boundary vegetation the following measures should be taken: (1)
   preventing nutrient input from the arable field; (2) mowing and removing
   of the mown material; (3) restricting annual disturbance to less than
   20\% of the area; (4) keeping the boundary as wide as possible but at
   least wider than the maximum fertiliser misplacement. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Extensive areas in the mountain grasslands of central Argentina are
   heavily invaded by alien species from Europe. A decrease in biodiversity
   and a loss of palatable species is also observed. The invasibility of
   the tall-grass mountain grassland community was investigated in an
   experiment of factorial design. Six alien species which are widely
   distributed in the region were sown in plots where soil disturbance,
   above-ground biomass removal by cutting and burning were used as
   treatments. Alien species did not establish in undisturbed plots. All
   three types of disturbances increased the number and cover of alien
   species; the effects of soil disturbance and biomass removal was
   cumulative. Cirsium vulgare and Oenothera erythrosepala were the most
   efficient alien colonizers. In conditions where disturbances did not
   continue the cover of aliens started to decrease in the second year, by
   the end of the third season, only a few adults were established.
   Consequently, disturbances are needed to maintain alien populations in
   tall-grass mountain grasslands. Burning also increased the species
   richness of native species. We conclude that an efficient way to control
   the distribution of alien species is to decrease grazing pressure while
   burning as a traditional management tool may be continued.}},

Abstract = {{The maintenance of grasslands as distinct habitats depends on regular
   management, usually through grazing or mowing, but their species
   diversity is known to decline with increasing management intensity. The
   reduction of management intensity can be a useful tool for the long-term
   conservation of the biological diversity of grasslands. We analyzed
   floral and faunal diversity on intensively and extensively (
   unintensively) grazed pastures and on 5- to 10-year-old ungrazed
   grasslands in northern Germany. Each of the three grassland habitats
   differing in grazing intensity was replicated six times. We related
   diverse taxa such as grasshoppers, butterfly adults and lepidopteran
   larvae, and trap-nesting solitary bees and wasps to vegetation
   structure. There was an increase of species richness and abundance from
   pastures to ungrazed grasslands. The percentage of parasitism of the
   most abundant trap-nesting species, the digger-wasp ( Trypoxylon
   figulus), was also higher on ungrazed grasslands. Decreased grazing on
   pastures enhanced species richness for adult butterflies only, whereas
   the abundance of adult butterflies, solitary bees and wasps, and their
   natural enemies increased. Although the differences in insect diversity
   between pastures and ungrazed grassland could be attributed to a greater
   vegetation height and heterogeneity (bottom-up effects) on ungrazed
   areas, the differences between intensively and extensively grazed
   pastures could not be explained by changes in vegetation
   characteristics. Hence, intensive grazing appeared to affect the insect
   communities through the disruption of plant-insect interactions. A
   mosaic of extensively grazed grassland and grassland left ungrazed for a
   few years may be a good means by which to maintain biodiversity and the
   strength of trophic interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Alien species invasions have already caused substantial ecological and
   economic damage and will likely have even greater negative consequences
   in the future. Thus, it is imperative to improve our basic ecological
   understanding of these invasions and enhance our ability to reverse or
   mitigate their often devastating effects. Invasions by fire-promoting
   alien grasses have played a particularly important role in the
   destruction, of tropical dry forests and are a major reason why these
   ecosystems are now among the most endangered in the world. We
   investigated how light availability (full sun and 50\% shade), alien
   grass control (bulldoze, herbicide, plastic mulch, and trim treatments),
   and native species additions (outplanting and direct-seeding) affected
   the establishment of native plants and the suppression of a dominant
   invasive bunchgrass (fountain grass, Pennisetum setaceum) within a
   highly degraded fenced dry forest remnant on the island of Hawaii. The
   percent cover of. native species increased in all light, grass control,
   and species addition treatments throughout the 20 mo of the experiment,
   and was greatest in the shade, bulldoze, and outplant treatments.
   Although fountain grass cover also increased over time in all grass
   control treatments, the three more aggressive techniques all
   significantly reduced grass cover relative to the more moderate trim
   treatment. In addition, there was a significant overall negative
   correlation between the final cover of fountain grass and native
   species, suggesting that these native species may successfully compete
   with fountain grass for water and/or nutrients. Outplant survival and
   the number of individuals established from direct-seeding differed
   significantly among the grass control treatments, and in each case, the
   response was highly species specific. Photosynthetic rates of
   established outplanted individuals and fountain grass did not differ
   significantly across most experimental environments, indicating that the
   local dominance of fountain grass may not be due to superior
   physiological attributes-The results of this experiment highlight the
   importance of investigating species- and treatment-specific responses
   before attempting larger-scale restoration projects, particularly when
   using rare and endangered species. This study also suggests that
   relatively simple techniques may be used to simultaneously establish
   populations of vigorous understory native species and suppress alien
   grasses at relatively large spatial scales, and that remnant or newly
   created favorable microsites may be exploited to facilitate the
   establishment of rarer native overstory species.}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{373-388}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The objective of the study was to describe the annual and seasonal
   production of live biomass of six plant species or communities of the
   uplands of the UK-Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus , Nardus stricta
   , Molinia caerulea, Eriophorum vaginatum and Agrostis-Festuca grassland.
   The species or communities are important for the management of the
   uplands to meet both biodiversity and agriculture objectives. The annual
   and seasonal production of live biomass was determined for sites within
   six regions of England and Wales in 1995, 1996 and 1997. The six regions
   were North-east England, North-west England, North Pennines, South
   Pennines, South-west England and Wales. In each region, the Institute of
   Terrestrial Ecology's Land Classification Scheme was used to select
   three or four 2 km x 2 km squares that contained a mosaic of C. vulgaris
   and upland grassland plant species. Uniform plots of 1 ha were selected
   from each 2 km x 2 km square, within which three measurements were made
   on each sampling occasion. Biomass of each species or community was
   measured within 1.0 x 0.5-m quadrats using the same standard procedures.
   Measurements of annual production of current season's shoots of the
   pioneer, building, mature and degenerate phases of C. vulgaris and of V.
   myrtillus were made in October, and of the annual production of live
   biomass of N. stricta , M. caerulea and E. vaginatum in August. A
   simulated grazing regime was imposed for the Agrostis-Festuca grassland
   with cuts being made to a height of 4 cm at 8-week intervals. The annual
   production of live biomass produced was estimated as the sum of four
   harvests taken during the growing season. Seasonal measurements of the
   amount of live biomass of all the species were also made in April, June,
   August and October. For C. vulgaris , there were significant (P = 0.05)
   differences between the pioneer, building, mature and degenerate phases
   in the annual production of current season's shoots, with greater
   amounts being produced by the phases of greater age and with higher
   biomass. There were significant year (P < 0.05) and region (P < 0.05)
   effects, with the lowest production in 1995 and in the South-west of
   England. The values were higher than those observed in previous studies
   in Scotland, and these were interpreted as being associated with a
   longer growing season rather than higher summer temperatures. There was
   no difference between years and regions in the annual production of V.
   myrtillus. For the grass species, there were small differences in annual
   production of live biomass between years and regions. However, the
   annual production of live biomass of N. stricta was significantly (P <
   0.01) lower in 1995 than in 1996 and 1997 and significantly (P < 0.001)
   lower in the South Pennines region than elsewhere. The effect of a range
   of weather and other environmental variables on the annual production of
   live biomass of each species of grass was explored, but they provided
   only a limited insight into the reasons for the observed differences and
   were found to be of limited value as predictors.}},

Abstract = {{1 The interactive effect of grazing and small-scale variation in primary
   productivity on the diversity of an annual plant community was studied
   in a semiarid Mediterranean rangeland in Israel over 4 years. The
   response of the community to protection from sheep grazing by fenced
   exclosures was compared in four neighbouring topographic sites (south-
   and north-facing slopes, hilltop and wadi (dry stream) shoulders),
   differing in vegetation, physical characteristics and soil resources.
   The herbaceous annual vegetation was highly diverse, including 128
   species. Average small-scale species richness of annuals ranged between
   5 and 16 species within a 20 x 20 cm quadrat, and was strongly affected
   by year and site.
   2 Above-ground potential productivity at peak season (i.e. in fenced
   subplots) was typical of semiarid ecosystems (10-200 g m(-2)), except on
   wadi shoulders (up to 700 g m(-2)), where it reached the range of
   subhumid grassland ecosystems. Grazing increased richness in the high
   productivity site (i.e. wadi), but did not affect, or reduced, it in the
   low productivity sites (south- and north-facing slopes, hilltop). Under
   grazing, species richness was positively and linearly related to
   potential productivity along the whole range of productivity. Without
   grazing, this relationship was observed only at low productivity (< 200
   g m(-2)).
   3 The effect of grazing along the productivity gradient on different
   components of richness was analysed. At low productivity, number of
   abundant, common and rare species all tended to increase with
   productivity, both with and without grazing. Rare species increased
   three times compared with common and abundant species. At high
   productivity, only rare species continued to increase with productivity
   under grazing, while in the absence of grazing species number in the
   different abundance groups was not related to productivity.
   4 In this semiarid Mediterranean rangeland, diversity of the annual
   plant community is determined by the interaction between grazing and
   small-scale spatial and temporal variation in primary productivity,
   operating mainly on the less abundant species in the community.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the effects of host plant volume on invertebrate
   density and taxon richness on a native New Zealand shrub, Olearia
   bullata (Asteraceae). Specimens were collected by beating during a
   single summer/autumn sampling event from 30 O. bullata plants. The
   influence of the surrounding environment was also examined by assessing
   canopy connectivity between O. bullata shrubs and their nearest
   neighbours (O. bullata and other shrub species). Linear regression
   analyses suggested a positive association between invertebrate taxon
   richness and shrub volume, a relationship that was also apparent at the
   Order level for Coleoptera, Diptera, and Psocoptera. No significant
   results were found between shrub volume and invertebrate density at any
   taxonomic level. Negative associations were obtained between the density
   of Araneae and Hemiptera against the distance between O. bullata shrubs.}},

Title = {{Effect of local and regional processes on plant species richness in
   tallgrass prairie}},

Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{571-579}},

Abstract = {{Historically, diversity in a community was often believed to result
   primarily from local processes, but recent evidence suggests that
   regional diversity may strongly influence local diversity as well. We
   used experimental and observational vegetation data from Konza Prairie,
   Kansas, USA, to determine if. (1) there is a relationship between local
   and regional richness in tallgrass prairie vegetation; (2) local
   dominance reduces local species richness; and (3) reducing local
   dominance increases local and regional species richness. We found a
   positive relationship between regional and local richness; however, this
   relationship varied with grazing, topography and fire frequency. The
   decline in variance explained in the grazed vegetation, in particular,
   suggested that local processes associated with grazing pressure on the
   dominant grasses strongly influenced local species richness.
   Experimental removal of one of the dominant grasses, Andropogon
   scoparius, from replicate plots resulted in a significant increase in
   local species richness compared to adjacent reference plots. Overall all
   sites, species richness was higher in grazed (192 spp.) compared to
   ungrazed (158 spp.) areas. Across the Konza Prairie landscape, however,
   there were no significant differences in the frequency distribution of
   species occurrences, or in the relationship between the number of sites
   occupied and average abundance in grazed compared to ungrazed areas.
   Thus, local processes strongly influenced local richness in this
   tallgrass prairie, but local processes did not produce different
   landscape-scale patterns in species distribution and abundance. Because
   richness was enhanced at all spatial scales by reducing the abundance of
   dominant species, we suggest that species richness in tallgrass prairie
   results from feedbacks between, and interactions among, processes
   operating at multiple scales in space and time.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of forages ingested by ruminants is one of the factors of
   variation of sensory properties of dairy products and meats. Recently,
   the effect of this factor was underlined, particularly for the PDO
   products. For these products, animal feeding is one of the elements that
   link the product to the ``terroir{''}.
   Grass conservation as silage does not seem to affect cheese sensory
   properties when the silage is done properly, except for the colour which
   tends to be more yellow when the animals are fed silage. Contrarily when
   the animals graze grass, the cheeses have a more intense coloar, flavour
   and odour, compared to winter rations based on hay and silage. The
   botanical composition of grass has an effect on cheese sensory
   properties. The most important differences regard texture, mainly in
   cooked type cheeses when cows graze in pastures with a great
   biodiversity.
   These sensory differences can be due to milk constituents coming
   directly from animal food. This is the case of carotenoids, responsible
   for the yellow colour of dairy products, and abundant in green forages.
   The differences can also be due to milk constituents that the animal
   produces which are different with different feeds. This is the case of
   the plasmin content of milk or fat composition that can affect cheese
   texture.
   Meat from animals grazing grass is darker and tougher than meat from
   animals given concentrates. This effect can be partially linked to the
   ultimate pH (for the colour), to the age at slaughter (generally higher
   for animals grazing grass), to the carcass fatness and to the
   intramuscular fat content (higher for animals given concentrates). Grass
   feeding also affects meat flavour. This effect is probably linked to an
   increase of skatole and its interaction with branched chain fatty acids.
   Also animals grazing grass have a higher proportion of linolenic acid in
   their fat. Some products of oxidation of linolenic acid are responsible
   for the pastoral flavour of meat.}},

Abstract = {{To control shrubs, which are increasing in dominance in wetlands
   worldwide, winter burning may be an important tool, especially from the
   perspective of minimizing urban hazards. The goal of this project was to
   determine if winter burning was successful in reducing the dominance
   (mean percentage cover and maximum height) of Cornus sericea in sedge
   meadows in southern Wisconsin, where shrubs proliferated after cattle
   were excluded. Experimental burn and control plots were set up within
   sedge meadows, including an ungrazed ``reference{''} site that had been
   little, if ever, grazed and a ``historically grazed{''} site, a recovery
   site that had not been grazed by cattle since 1973. None of the dominant
   species including C. sericea was significantly affected by burning for
   either mean percentage cover or maximum height (analysis of variance: no
   burning x species interaction). Both mean percentage cover and maximum
   height were only weakly related to burning (28.1 and 14.3\% of the
   variability contributed to the cumulative percentage of the coefficient
   of determination, respectively) at both sites based on non-metric
   multidimensional scaling analysis. Although species richness increased
   in burned plots in 1999 and 2000, no differences were apparent between
   pre-burned and unburned plots in 1997 and unburned plots in 1999 and
   2000 (analysis of variance: year x burning interaction). After burning
   in the ungrazed site, herbaceous species appeared that had not been
   detected for decades, including Chelone glabra and Lathyrus palustris.
   Exotic species were present in both the ungrazed reference and recovery
   site. Although winter burning treatments did not reduce the dominance of
   woody shrub species in the site recovering from cattle grazing, burning
   was useful in stimulating the maintenance of species richness in the
   ungrazed sedge meadow.}},

   As one of the few biodiversity hotspots in central Asia, it was listed

   But in the last 25 years, the population of wild swans has decreased

   suffers from overgrazing and degradation. Moreover, the local government

Abstract = {{We demonstrated the effect of cross-habitat foraging by sika deer
   (Cervus nippon) on plant communities under the hypothesis that the
   intensity of herbivory on a plant community is changed by the presence
   of a preferable habitat for deer nearby. To investigate this
   landscape-level effect, we examined two types of forest understory;
   ``adjacent site{''} was located near agricultural fields where deer
   prefer to forage, and ``remote site{''} was far from fields. We compared
   plant community structures between adjacent and remote sites in areas
   with high deer densities, and found that plant species richness and
   plant coverage were significantly higher in adjacent sites than in
   remote sites. We hypothesized that this difference was caused by the
   lower intensity of browsing at adjacent sites due to the higher use of
   fields by the deer at these sites. The following four results supported
   this hypothesis. First, in areas with no deer, plant species richness
   and plant coverage did not differ significantly between adjacent and
   remote sites. Second, we demonstrated a lower intensity of herbivory at
   adjacent sites by experimentally transplanting a preferred plant
   species, Aucuba japonica. Third, we detected no difference in the number
   of deer fecal pellets found in adjacent and remote sites, indicating
   that the difference in browsing intensity between the two sites was not
   due to differences in the frequency of site use by the deer. Fourth,
   fecal analysis showed that deer at adjacent sites consumed more
   graminoids, suggesting that deer at these sites used fields to forage
   because graminoids were abundant in fields. All of these results support
   the notion that the intensity of herbivory on forest understorys becomes
   lower in the presence of agricultural fields nearby. This also implies
   the importance of the indirect effects at the landscape level in that
   the two ecosystems are linked by the consumers moving between them.}},

Abstract = {{Proposed links between biodiversity and ecosystem processes have
   generated intense interest and controversy in recent years. With few
   exceptions, however, empirical studies have focused on grassland plants
   and laboratory aquatic microbial systems, whereas there has been little
   attention to how changing animal diversity may influence ecosystem
   processes. Meanwhile, a separate research tradition has demonstrated
   strong top-down forcing in many systems, but has considered the role of
   diversity in these processes only tangentially. Integration of these
   research directions is necessary for more complete understanding in both
   areas. Several considerations suggest that changing diversity in
   multi-level food webs can have important ecosystem effects that can be
   qualitatively different than those mediated by plants. First;
   extinctions tend to be biased by trophic level: higher-level consumers
   are less diverse, less abundant, and under stronger anthropogenic
   pressure on average than wild plants, and thus face greater risk of
   extinction. Second, unlike plants, consumers often have impacts on
   ecosystems disproportionate to their abundance. Thus, an early
   consequence of declining diversity will often be skewed trophic
   structure, potentially reducing top-down influence. Third, where
   predators remain abundant, declining diversity at lower trophic levels
   may change effectiveness of predation and penetrance of trophic cascades
   by reducing trait diversity and the potential for compensation among
   species within a level. The mostly indirect evidence available provides
   some support for this prediction. Yet effects of changing animal
   diversity on functional processes have rarely been tested
   experimentally. Evaluating impacts of biodiversity loss on ecosystem
   function requires expanding the scope of current experimental research
   to multi-level food webs. A central challenge to doing so, and to
   evaluating the importance of trophic cascades specifically, is
   understanding the distribution of interaction strengths within natural
   communities and how they change with community composition. Although
   topology of most real food webs is extremely complex, it is not at all
   clear how much of this complexity translates to strong dynamic linkages
   that influence aggregate biomass and community composition. Finally,
   there is a need for more detailed data on patterns of species loss from
   real ecosystems (community ``disassembly{''} rules).}},

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{338-346}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies have shown that a high species or functional group
   richness may not always lead to a greater resistance of plant
   communities to invasion, whereas species and/or functional group
   composition can more reliably predict invasion resistance. The aim of
   this study was to understand the mechanisms through which functional
   group composition can influence the resistance of Mediterranean annual
   communities to invasion by the exotic Conyza bonariensis. To analyse the
   effects of functional composition on the performance of individuals
   introduced as seedlings we first examined the relationships between the
   demographic and vegetative parameters of C. bonariensis and the biomass
   achieved by each functional group (grasses, legumes and Asteraceae
   rosettes) in synthetic communities. As a further step to approach the
   mechanisms involved in community resistance to invasion, we included in
   the analyses measurements of functional variables taken within the
   synthetic communities.
   In agreement with earlier results and theory suggesting that high
   nutrient availability can favour invasions, an abundant legume biomass
   in communities increased the final biomass and net fecundity of C.
   bonariensis, due to positive effects on soil nitrate concentration.
   Survival and establishment of C. bonariensis were mainly favoured by a
   high biomass of Asteraceae. Additional results from measurements of
   herbivory suggested that C. bonariensis survival wasn't related to
   abiotic conditions but may be owed to a protection against herbivores in
   plots with abundant Asteraceae. Establishment was on the other hand
   likely to be hindered by the effects of abundant grass and legume
   foliage on light quality, and therefore easier within an Asteraceae
   canopy.
   We conclude that invasion of Mediterranean old fields by species with
   biologies similar to C. bonariensis could be limited by favouring
   communities dominated by annual grasses.}},

Abstract = {{Four variants in four replications were studied on permanent meadow
   stand oil Czech and Moravian highlands. The altitude a.s.l. is 485 m,
   original growth type was Dactylidetum, association Trifolio-Festucetum
   rubrae. Four variants: control (without fertilization), 40 kg P + 100 kg
   K.ha(-1), 100 kg N.ha(-1) (+ PK) and 200 N.ha(-1) (+ PK) were evaluated.
   Botanical analyses of stands were done by the method of reduced
   projective dominance (D in \%). The cut green matter was weighed up,
   mean samples for dry matter determination and chemical analyses were
   taken. Botanical composition of the meadow stand in 1991-2000 was not
   stabile and was changing due to nourishment. The yields of dry matter
   ranged within 10 years in the control variant from 1.07-3.42 t.ha(-1)
   (in the plot fertilized by P40K100 2.09-5.95 t.ha(-1), in the plots with
   nitrogen (+ PK) 2.29-6.52 t.ha(-1), resp. 3.74-7.61 t.ha(-1)). According
   to the t-test, the yields of dry mass in experimental variants are
   significant at 95\% level.}},

Abstract = {{Riparian plant community composition is influenced by moisture, erosion,
   original native plant communities, and current and past land use. This
   study compared riparian plant communities under four types of
   management: woody buffer strip, grassy buffer strip, rotational grazing,
   and continuous grazing. Study sites were located along spring-fed
   streams in the unglaciated region of southwestern Wisconsin, USA. At
   each site, plant community surveys were conducted using a point transect
   method. Among the treatments, woody buffer strips, rotationally grazed
   and continuously grazed riparian areas had greater plant species
   richness than grassy buffer strips, and woody buffer strips had the
   greatest native plant specie's richness. Reed canarygrass (Phalaris
   arundinacea L.) was prevalent in grassy buffer strips (44\% of all
   observations), common in woody buffer strips (15\%), and rare in sites
   that were rotationally or continuously grazed (3 and 5\%, respectively).
   Pasture sites had greater proportions of native grasses and grass
   relatives and moderate levels of overall native species richness.
   Considered a water quality best management practice, well-managed
   rotational grazing may be a reasonable alternative to buffer strips
   which can contribute to protection and enhancement of native vegetation
   biodiversity. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity includes both taxonomic and functional aspects, each of
   which can play significant roles in ecosystem functioning. The number of
   functional groups, specifically intratrophic group (e.g., plant or
   herbivore) functional richness (F), serves as a simple index of
   ecological diversity, while species richness (S) serves as a simple
   index of taxonomic diversity. F and S are, however, roughly correlated
   measures of biodiversity, and disentangling the relative influence of
   one over the other on ecosystem functioning (H) requires a multivariate
   index. Appropriate multivariate biodiversity indices can be derived by
   applying principal component analyses to the set of possible
   combinations of S and F in an experimental design. The first principal
   component (PCAI) represents covariation between F and S, while the
   second principal component (PCAII) provides information on functioning
   that is associated with the independent effects of F and S. Thus, one
   can replace the conventional model H = f(F, S) with H = f(PCAI, PCAII).
   This approach obviates a number of statistical problems encountered when
   following the traditional approach. Furthermore, if the question being
   addressed concerns the relationship be tween biodiversity and ecosystem
   functioning and not the relative contributions of F and S, PCAI may be
   used to develop more tractable, yet effective experimental designs than
   the conventional, exhaustive F X S experimental studies currently in
   favor. I explore the theoretical foundation for this multivariate
   approach and provide an example using the results from experimental
   prairie grassland plant assemblages at Cedar Creek Natural History Area,
   Minnesota, USA. This study highlights the need to adapt traditional,
   taxonomic approaches to biodiversity research to include functional
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Monoliths of a fertile, N limited, C3 grassland community were subjected
   (or not) to an atmospheric CO2 enrichment (600 mumol mol(-1) ) using a
   Mini-FACE system, from August 1998 to June 2001 and were subjected to
   two contrasting cutting frequencies (3 and 6 cuts per year). We report
   here the effects of the CO2 and cutting frequency factors on the plant
   community structure and its diversity.
   Species-specific responses to elevated CO2 and cutting frequency were
   observed, which resulted in significant changes in the botanical
   composition of the grassland monoliths. Elevated CO2 significantly
   increased the proportion of dicotyledones (forbs + legumes) and reduced
   that of the monocotyledones (grasses). Management differentiated this
   response as elevated CO2 increased the proportion of forbs when
   infrequently and of legumes when frequently defoliated. However, among
   the two dominant forbs species only one was significantly enhanced by
   elevated CO2. Moreover, not all grass species responded negatively to
   high CO2. At a low cutting frequency, the observed decline under ambient
   CO2 in species diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) and in forb species
   number was partly alleviated by elevated CO2 .
   This experiment shows that the botanical composition of temperate
   grasslands is likely to be affected by the current rise (+ 0.5\% per
   year) in the atmospheric CO2 concentration, and that grassland
   management guidelines may need to be adapted to a future high CO2 world.}},

Abstract = {{Plants associated with traditional agricultural landscapes in northern
   Europe and Scandinavia are subjected to drastic habitat fragmentation.
   In this paper we discuss species response to fragmentation, against a
   background of vegetation and land-use history. Recent evidence suggests
   that grassland-forest mosaics have been prevalent long before the onset
   of human agriculture. We suggest that the creation of infield meadows
   and outland grazing (during the Iron Age) increased the amount and
   spatial predictability of grasslands, resulting in plant communities
   with exceptionally high species densities. Thus, distribution of plant
   species in the present-day landscape reflects historical land-use. This
   holds also when traditional management has ceased, due to a slow
   response by many species to abandonment and fragmentation. The
   distribution patterns are thus not in equilibrium with the present
   habitat distribution. Fragmentation influences remaining semi-natural
   grasslands such that species density is likely to decline as a result of
   local extinctions and invasion by habitat generalists. However, species
   that for a long time have been subjected to changing mosaic landscapes
   may be more resistant to fragmentation than is usually believed.
   Conservation should focus not only on `hot-spots' with high species
   richness, but also consider species dynamics in a landscape context.}},

Abstract = {{Past landscape characteristics were reconstructed in Nynas,
   south-eastern Sweden, using geographical and archaeological data
   together with pollen stratigraphy and an existing shore displacement
   model, with the aim to explore the development of semi-natural
   grasslands in the area. A 2.3 m peat core was analysed and radiocarbon
   dated at three levels. The pollen stratigraphy was estimated to start at
   approximately 3800 C-14 years before present (BP), at the end of Late
   Neolithic. Human activities are evident, from both archaeological
   findings and pollen analysis, for more than 4000 years. Grazing is
   apparent, possibly more intense around 3200 C-14 years BP, 2500-2600
   C-14 years BP, 2100-2200 C-14 years BP, and 1300/1400 C-14 years BP to
   present day. From 1900+/-80 C-14 years BP and onwards cultivation is
   intensified at the same time as spruce (Picea abies) expands. Maps on
   land-cover distribution in the late 17th century was used as a model for
   the utilisation of the landscape during the Iron Age. Land-covers on
   very thin soils were grazed and sometimes mown within the village
   boundaries, but they were also used for cultivation in narrow strips
   where bedrock is adjacent to clays. Till and varved glacial clays would
   have been used for cultivation. A reasonable estimation is that 10\% of
   the study area could have been used for cultivation 1900 C-14 years BP,
   compared to 28\% in the end of the 17th century. During the last century
   there has been a shift towards more arable fields and more forestry.
   There are 10\% open or semi-open grassland left today, and 6\% wooded
   grassland, compared with 47\% open or semi-open grassland in the 17th
   century. Little more than half of the open grasslands are managed today,
   all by grazing. It is argued that encroachment of trees and shrubs on
   open or semi-open grasslands will not only reduce species richness in
   the landscape but also threaten parts of our cultural heritage. (C) 2002

Abstract = {{Previous experiments that tested whether diverse plant communities have
   lower invasibility have all varied species richness. We experimentally
   varied evenness of four grassland species (three grasses and one forb)

   seasons. By varying evenness, we eliminated any sampling effect in our
   diversity treatment, because all plots contained the same plant species.
   Experimentally reducing evenness led to a greater number of dicot
   invaders, which emerged in plots throughout the growing season, but had
   less of an effect on monocot invaders, which emerged in flushes when
   experimental plants were semi-dormant. Frequency of Solidago canadensis
   (altissima ) stems with spittle bugs significantly increased with
   reductions in evenness during the first year, apparently because the
   greater number of Solidago stems in high evenness plots diluted the

   to the islands of Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket, scattered species
   records are also collated from Naushon, Nashawena, Pasque, Tuckernuck,
   Muskeget, Penikese, and Cuttyhunk Islands. With 56 documented species,
   Martha's Vineyard, the largest of the islands, appears despite sampling
   bias to support the most diverse scarab fauna, followed by Nantucket,
   with 46 species. These two faunas account for 71 of the 74 species known
   from all the islands. A subset of these data consisting of scarabs from
   2,700 pitfall trap samples is used to compare species richness and
   relative abundance at five sites on the two islands under varying

   focused on grassland habitats, these represent a minority of the

Abstract = {{The landscapes of the French island of Corsica are the result of the
   grazing tradition which has always occupied a pivotal position in the
   island's economy. Furthermore, in the last fifty years, a reduction in
   the pressure from human activity has lead to changes in plant cover.
   This article intends to study the evolution of dynamic mechanisms during
   the secondary successions and the effect of changes in vegetation on
   plant diversity. Our study was based on a simultaneous study of 375
   plots carried out between May and September from 1996 to 1998. We
   studied the floristic composition of each stage both qualitatively (life
   form, adaptive strategy and seed dispersal mode) and quantitatively
   (species richness, equitability, Shannon index). The results show a
   change in species and environmental conditions, with a progressive move
   from heliophilic grassland and low shrub species with an S or SR
   strategy, anemochoric and with a high tolerance for soil quality to a
   final stage of dense forest composed of competitive (C or CS) zoochoric
   or barochoric phanerophytes. Moreover, the turning point in Corsica in
   terms of floristic diversity lies between 20 and 55 years after land
   abandonment. Successions are due to a series of rapid interactions.
   Thus, when a site is given reserve or protected area status, we need to
   take into account the fact that it will evolve according to the
   biological traits of the species. From a research point of view, we need
   to look at process diversity and the role of each of the species present
   during the successions.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of grazing and 10 years of cattle exclusion on floristic
   composition and diversity and on structural diversity were studied in
   natural mountain grasslands at Sierras as de Cordoba (2,200 m of
   elevation), Argentine. We consider structural diversity as the
   arrangement complexity of biomass in space, both horizontal and
   vertical. The abundance of all plant species and their vertical and
   horizontal arrangement were recorded by means of 50 randomly assorted
   pins, each of them subdivided into 20 cm height intervals. Sampling was
   performed inside five replicates, each of them consisted of two adjacent
   20 x 20 m plots separated by a fence, one grazed and another excluded
   from grazing. Floristic and vertical structure diversity were estimated
   by means of Shannon index. The variance in floristic and vertical
   structure diversity indexes were compared among treatments to study
   possible variations in the horizontal distribution of both floristic
   diversity and vertical structure, respectively. Species richness and
   floristic diversity were higher in grazed grasslands. Over 85\% of total
   plant species occurred at grazed grasslands, in contrast to 65\% in
   sites excluded from grazing. Only three exotic plant species were found,
   one of them exclusive to grazed sites. Cattle grazing produced a
   significant decrease in vertical structure diversity and in the variance
   in horizontal space of floristic diversity, but did not produce
   significant changes in the variance in horizontal space of vertical
   structure diversity. Although cattle grazing promotes lawns of high
   floristic diversity, it produces an over simplification of the community
   structure, both vertical and horizontal, probably affecting other
   trophic levels of the ecosystem. We consider that the mixture in space
   of both types of patches studied in the present work would allow a
   better balance between cattle grazing and conserving floristic and
   structural diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of grazing intensity on plant and insect diversity were
   examined in four different types of grassland (intensively and
   extensively cattle-grazed pastures, short-term and long-term ungrazed
   grassland; 24 study sites). Vegetation complexity (plant species
   richness, vegetation height, vegetation heterogeneity) was significantly
   higher on ungrazed grasslands compared to pastures but did not differ
   between intensively and extensively grazed pastures. However, insect
   species richness was higher on extensively than on intensively grazed
   pastures, established by suction sampling of four insect taxa
   (Auchenorrhyncha, Heteroptera, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Parasitica).
   This may be due to intensive grazing disrupting plant-insect
   associations as predicted by a ``trophic-level{''} hypothesis. Local
   persistence and small-scale recolonization of insects on plants appeared
   to be difficult in the highly disturbed environment of intensive
   grazing. Insect diversity increased across the four treatments in the
   following order: intensively grazed <extensively grazed <short-term
   ungrazed <long-term ungrazed. The major predictor variable of
   differences in species diversity was found to be vegetation height.
   Predator-prey ratios within the investigated insect groups were not

Abstract = {{We conducted a study on a landfill site in the Northwest of Berlin,
   Germany, where silty sand of low fertility was colonised by
   Calamagrostis epigejos (L.) ROTH and other grassland and ruderal
   species. Five plots of 3m x 3m size were mown twice yearly (end of
   May/beginning of June and end of August) and five plots were left
   unmown. Species composition and cover of the central 4m(2) of each plot
   were followed over five years of vegetation development with records in
   spring and late summer. In the fifth year we also determined number of
   shoots of C. epigejos and above ground dry mass of C. epigejos, other
   herbaceous species, and woody plants. C. epigejos colonised all plots
   within one year after the deposition of the substrate. On unmown plots,
   mean cover of C. epigejos increased towards 35\% in the fifth year.
   Mowing significantly affected C. epigejos, showing mean cover values
   within a range from < 1\% to 6.7\%. On unmown plots, mean total cover
   increased from approx. 10\% in the first year to 80\% in the fifth year
   after the start of the succession. On mown plots, total cover also
   increased to 60\% until May of year four, but then decreased towards
   about 45\%. Species richness on unmown plots did not significantly
   change during the five subsequent years, but there are significant
   differences between seasons, with higher species numbers in spring.
   Mowing significantly increased species richness during the course of
   vegetation development. In the fifth year, species richness on mown
   plots was 30.4 +/- 4.5 species/4m(2) (spring), respectively 26.2 +/- 3.4
   species/4m(2) (summer) and 24.6 +/- 5.0 species/4m(2) (spring),
   respectively 20.6 +/- 3.2 species/4m(2) (summer) on unmown plots. While
   mowing only slightly reduced above ground dry mass of other herbaceous
   species, the effect on C. epigejos was evident. In the fifth year shoot
   density of C. epigejos on unmown plots was 924 315 shoots/4m(2) and 408
   +/- 255 shoots/4m(2) (spring), respectively 347 +/- 234 shoots/4m(2)
   (summer), on mown plots. Mean above ground dry mass of C. epigejos on
   unmown plots was 611.6 +/- 255.3 g/4m(2) and 56.4 +/- 33 g/4m(2)
   (spring) + 28.8 +/- 19.6 g/4m(2) (summer) = 75.2 +/- 50.3 g/4m(2)
   (total) on mown plots. Total above ground dry mass on unmown plots

Abstract = {{1. Understanding the effects of red deer Cervus elaphus grazing on a
   range of plant communities is important for formulating guidelines for
   the management of forestry plantations, nature reserves and deer hunting
   enterprises.
   2. The effects of red deer on the species composition of plant
   communities varying in productivity were examined on the Isle of Rum,
   Inner Hebrides, north-west Scotland.
   3. The study compared vegetation inside and outside fences erected to
   exclude deer for more than 20 years, and between areas of the island
   where different deer culling policies were instigated in 1991.
   4. The effect of the exclusion of deer was directly proportional to
   vegetation type. Long-term deer exclusion (20-40 years) had negligible
   effects on the species composition of the most unproductive plant
   communities, but caused a marked decline in the species richness of
   productive grassland. The decline was due to the loss of prostrate herb
   species inside exclosures where Festuca rubra had assumed a high
   dominance.
   5. Changes in the size and sex ratio of the deer populations were not
   associated with major changes in plant species richness or relative
   abundance. The most notable change occurred in productive grassland.
   Here, Festuca rubra had greater cover and several low-growing herbs such
   as Polygala serpyllifolia and Thymus polytrichus had lower cover in
   areas where hind numbers had been reduced than in areas where there was
   no culling.
   6. High deer densities within an unculled food-limited population were
   associated with negligible effects on plants in Molinia caerulea flush
   and Calluna-Molinia wet heath vegetation.
   7. Tree regeneration inside the exclosures or in areas where deer were
   culled was minor; only two solitary rowan Sorbus aucuparia saplings were
   found.
   8. Flowerhead densities of herbaceous plant species and grasses showed
   trends that could be associated with cattle grazing. It is suggested
   that this may lead to changed recruitment, although seed sowing
   experiments are required to test this.
   9. The results suggest that red deer grazing sustains the plant species
   diversity of productive grasslands, with reduced deer grazing leading to
   the loss of plant species in these communities. In contrast, the effects
   of reduced deer densities and altered culling policies on unproductive
   vegetation types are negligible.}},

   extensification of grassland for grazing and potato cultivation for the
   upper limit, and (2) the intensification of the agricultural frontier,
   fuelwood gathering, and timber extraction for the lower limit. Although
   we do not claim to fully debunk the prevalent paradigm of tree line
   dynamics (which is descriptive, depends on the natural sciences, and
   sees tree lines as physically controlled), we hope to achieve increased
   recognition for a challenging alternate view of tropical tree lines as
   functional, resource-use dependent, and human-driven. Management plans
   and overall tropical montane cloud forest conservation strategies need
   to consider this new perspective and incorporate a proactive and

Abstract = {{This paper examined vascular-plant and cryptogam species diversity on
   different spatial scales in semi-natural grasslands along an elevational
   gradient ranging from 530 m a.s.l. (southern boreal region) to 1230 m
   a.s.l. (low alpine region) in Vang, southern Norway. Species diversity
   of vascular-plants on a small scale (0.25 m(2)) peaked at
   mid-elevations. Diversity at low elevations was not higher than that of
   high elevations, but diversity on a large scale decreased continuously
   with elevation. Cryptogam diversity increased with elevation on all
   scales. High small-scale vascular-plant diversity at high elevations was
   positively related to species abundance which increased with elevation,
   and suggests an area effect along the gradient. Most species at
   mid-elevational levels (750 and 915 m a.s.l.) did also occur at other
   levels. Lowland vascular-plant species constituted 50\% of the species
   in the low alpine region. Collectively, these patterns reflect the
   importance of regional dynamics along the gradient. Environmental
   variables such as topography, biomass, soil variables were less
   important for explaining variation in vascular plant diversity, and it
   is suggested that land-use processes such as grazing, mowing, fuel-wood
   cutting have levelled out the effects of other variables along the
   gradient.}},

Abstract = {{The Lorraine region, in northeast France, harbours 77 protected plant
   species whose main localities are in grasslands. About 80\% of them are
   very rare or rare (less than 15 localities) in that territory and are
   threatened by changes in agriculture. These species occur in a large
   range of grassland habitats, reflecting variability of climatic,
   hydrological and edaphic parameters, but also of agricultural practices.
   A more precise analysis of management requirements was carried out for
   seven of these species, Euphorbia palustris, Aster amellus, Pulsatilla
   alba, Carex hordeistichos, Thalictrum minus ssp. majus, Botrychium
   matricariifolium and Ophioglossum vulgatum, which were represented on a
   triangle whose corners correspond to grazing, cutting and no or very low
   exploitation. It confirmed the large diversity of management practices
   required to ensure conservation of rare and threatened grassland plant
   species, even at a local level. These appropriate conservation measures
   have therefore to be carried out or, at least, monitored by specialized
   nature conservation organizations.}},

Abstract = {{Soil CO2 flux was measured across 947 plots at 7 experimental grassland
   sites at the Cedar Creek Natural History Area in order to determine the
   relationships between Soil CO2 flux and environmental factors, living

   progressed, and was positively related to aboveground biomass,
   belowground biomass, and soil \% C. However, most of the variation in
   Soil CO2 flux explained by a multiple regression model (r(2) = 0.55) was
   attributed to the different experimental sites (61\%). Soil CO2 flux
   increased with increasing aboveground plant biomass (explaining 16\% of
   the model variation), belowground plant biomass (12\%), and soil C and
   C:N ratio (6\%). The length of time between aboveground biomass in a
   plot was clipped and soil CO2 flux varied among plots. Soil CO2 flux
   declined with increased time since clipping, supporting the idea that
   recently fixed carbon is a significant component of Soil CO2 flux. Soil
   CO2 flux did not follow standard Q(10) relationships. Over a 20 degreesC

Abstract = {{Capsule The amount of forest (at local and landscape scales) and
   occurrence of residual habitats at the local scale are shown to be the
   major factors influencing bird community composition in farmland-forest
   landscapes in central Sweden.
   Aims To investigate the importance of local habitat and landscape
   structure for breeding birds in farmland-forest landscapes in central
   Sweden.
   Methods Breeding birds were censused at 292 points. A detailed habitat
   mapping was made within 300 m of the points. Within a 300-600 m radius
   only two major habitats (forests and arable fields) were identified.
   Results Cluster analyses of bird communities identified three site types
   that also differed in habitat composition: (i) partially forested sites
   in forested landscapes; (ii) heterogeneous sites with residual habitats
   in mosaic landscapes; and (iii) field-dominated farmland sites in open
   landscapes. A total of 19 of 25 farmland bird species (restricted to
   farmland or using both farmland and forest) had the highest abundance in
   farmland sites with mosaics of forest and farmland, while only six
   farmland species had the highest abundance in field-dominated sites. The
   bird community changed from being dominated by farmland species to being
   dominated by forest species (common in forest landscapes without
   farmland) at small proportions (10-20\%) of forest at the local scale. A
   major difference in habitat composition between heterogeneous and
   field-dominated sites was the occurrence of different residual habitats
   (e.g. shrubby areas and seminatural grasslands). These habitats seemed
   to influence bird community composition more than land-use, despite
   covering <10\% of the area. Seminatural grasslands were important for
   bird community composition and species-richness, but grazing seemed to
   be less important. Among different land-use types, cereal crops were the
   least preferred fields. Set-asides with tall vegetation and short
   rotation coppices were positively associated with species-richness of
   farmland birds.
   Conclusion In general, the composition of the landscape was important
   for bird community composition, although amount and distribution of
   forests, occurrence of residual habitats and land-use of fields at the
   local scale had the strongest influence on bird community composition.
   The possible implications of these patterns for managing farmland-forest
   landscapes are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Forestry is expanding in New Zealand and increasingly contributing to
   the economy. The expansion has also altered the landscape and will
   continue to do so. In addition, the implementation of the district plan
   under the Resource Management Act (RMA) 1991 also directly influences
   the expansion of forestry and the future land-use. Using Nelson region
   as a case study, the difference in land-use distribution patterns
   between the mid-1970s and 1990s, and the land-use changes over the 20
   years were interpreted. The factors influencing the changes were also
   examined. Because landscape is mainly changed by human activity,
   land-use change was considered from an economic perspective. Thus, the
   productivity, the land-use capability (LUC), and the distance from the
   city center were considered as well as the physical attributes of the
   land. The objective was to establish a data set from which future
   land-use could be predicted.
   Forest expansion over the period was mainly from shrub or pasture, and
   horticulture expansion from pasture. Both changes probably were related
   to the higher returns from forestry and horticulture than from sheep
   grazing or dairy farming. Based on discriminant analysis, the distance
   from the city was always the main factor determining the land-use
   change, which reflects costs and ease of transportation. Conversion to
   plantation over the 20-year period was closer to the city than
   conversion to pasture. Since more intensive and higher demand land-use
   tends to be closer to the city, this means that forestry had priority
   over pasture during this period. If this tendency continues, it will
   probably change the regions land-use distribution pattern in the future,
   The large conversion of shrub to other land-uses over the period is of
   concern because of risk of reduction in biodiversity and loss of habitat
   for threatened species. Based on discriminant analysis, the data set in
   this study was useful for predicting the future land-use. (C) 2002

Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{427-444}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. To explore how rangeland grazing affects native plant diversity at
   local and regional scales, we measured the frequency of occurrence of
   plant species along six transects spread across a large region of and
   calcareous rangelands in north-western South Australia. Four transects
   were in commercial sheep-grazed paddocks and two were in otherwise
   similar lands that had never been developed for pastoralism. Each
   transect comprised four sites of area 0.5 km(2), at distances of 1, 4, 7
   and 10 kin from the nearest stock watering point in a paddock, or from a
   nominal starting point >10 km from water in the undeveloped lands.
   2. Nearly 200 plant species were recorded, but distributions were
   patchy, with >30\% of species present at <10\% of sites.
   3. The apparent influence of pastoral development and proximity to water
   varied with the scale of inquiry. At the regional level, pastoral
   development had a predominantly negative effect on the abundance of
   species: 16 species were less abundant in paddocks than in lands that
   had never been developed, and only one species was more abundant.
   Localized trends within paddocks were more positive: significantly more
   species showed trends of increasing abundance with increasing proximity
   to watering points and associated grazing activity.
   4. The study results are consistent with a general pattern whereby
   pastoral development enhances richness of plant species at a local scale
   (by providing opportunities for more species to establish) but has the
   potential to decrease it at a regional scale (by removing the most
   grazing-sensitive species from the regional species pool).
   5. The results suggest there may be two fundamentally different
   mechanisms whereby species decline in abundance under grazing.
   Palatable, drought-hardy, perennial species are more likely to decline
   in abundance with proximity to water and associated accumulated grazing
   pressure in paddocks. Uncommon or short-lived species that are
   selectively grazed during very good seasons are more likely to decline
   everywhere in paddocks, regardless of the location of water points.
   6. If both mechanisms contribute to species decline there may need to be
   a mix of strategies for protecting all species in any regional network
   of conservation reserves.}},

   declined as a result of the systematic heavy grazing by large herds of
   domestic cattle and sheep which reduced the available levels of fine
   fuel and organized fire suppression efforts that succeeded in altering
   the natural fire regime. The greatly diminished role of recurrent fire
   in these ecosystems is thought to be responsible for ecologically
   adverse shifts in the composition, structure and diversity of these
   grasslands, leading specifically to the rise of ruderal species and
   invasion by less fire-tolerant species. The purpose of this study was to
   evaluate the ecological effects of fire season and frequency on the
   shortgrass prairie and to determine the means by which prescribed fire
   can best be restored in this ecosystem to provide the greatest benefit
   for numerous resource values. Plant cover, diversity, biomass and
   nutrient status, litter cover and soil chemistry were measured prior to
   and following fire treatments on a buffalograss-blue grama shortgrass
   prairie in northeastern New Mexico. Dormant-season fire was followed by
   increases in grass cover, forb cover, species richness and
   concentrations of foliar P, K, Ca, Mg and Mn. Growing-season fire
   produced declines in the cover of buffalograss, graminoids and forbs and
   increases in litter cover and levels of foliar P, K, Ca and Mn. Although
   no changes in soil chemistry were observed, both fire treatments caused
   decreases in herbaceous production, with standing biomass resulting from
   growing-season fire similar to600kg/ha and dormant-season fire similar
   to1200kg/ha, compared with controls similar to1800kg/ha. The initial
   findings of this long-term experiment suggest that dormant-season
   burning may be the preferable method for restoring fire in shortgrass
   prairie ecosystems where fire has been excluded for a prolonged time
   period.}},

Abstract = {{We report on spontaneous and directed succession on a dry sandy landfill
   site of low fertility at Berlin-Malchow, Germany. Changes in species
   composition and cover were followed on unmown and mown permanent plots
   of 2 x 2 m size through 5 years of vegetation development. Species
   richness on unmown plots was relatively constant during the time of
   observation, with 20 to 25 species per 4 m(2) . Total cover of unmown
   plots continuously increased from approximately 10\% in the first year
   to 80\% in the fifth year. There are no clearly discernible sequential
   successional stages until present. The species composition includes
   species of all life forms, which colonized the site immediately after
   the initiation of the succession process representing the initial
   floristic composition type of vegetation development. However, perennial
   grasses and herbs gradually increased in cover up to approximately 40\%.
   Woody plants were also present from the first year of succession and
   increased up to more than 20\% cover in the fifth year, forming a shrub
   layer (>0.5 m) after the second year. Mowing significantly increased
   species richness, which was evident from the third year onward. This
   effect was mainly due to the reduction of the tall perennial grass
   Calamagrostis epigejos. Solidago canadensis and woody species were also
   significantly affected (lower cover and height), whereas short perennial
   herbs like Plantago lanceolata and Trifolium repens benefited from
   mowing.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of grazing on the standing vegetation and the
   germinable soil seed bank in natural mountain grasslands at Pampa de
   Achala, Cordoba Province, Argentine. We analyzed the germinable seed
   bank at two depths (0-5 and 5-10 cm) in five replicates from sites
   grazed at a moderate to intense grazing intensity, and in five
   replicates from sites excluded from herbivores during the last 10 years.
   We recorded species frequency on the standing vegetation and species
   abundance in the germinable seed bank. Grazing did not produce
   significant changes in the number of species of the standing vegetation,
   but produced an increase in species diversity due to a decrease in the
   dominance of perennial grasses such as Deyeuxia hieronymi and Festuca
   tucumanica. We registered only three alien species in the grasslands
   under study. Grazing did not produce significant changes in the seed
   bank richness and diversity. Average seed bank density significantly did
   not change after grazing, however, the density of the annual grass
   Muhlenbergia peruviana increased, while that of the tussock grass
   Deyeuxia hieronymi decreased in grazed plots. Seeds present in litter at
   the excluded sites comprised 20 \% of the total number of species and 43
   \% of the total seed density. Ordination analysis, taking into account
   floristic composition of standing vegetation and the germinable seed
   bank, showed higher segregation between grazed-ungrazed samples than
   samples from vegetation and from the seed bank. At both grazed and
   protected sites, there were dominance of species with transient seed
   banks, followed by species with short and long persistent seed banks,
   respectively. Grazing, or its absence, did not modify plant species
   abundance of most species at the germinable seed bank, moreover, the two
   species that changed their seed density showed two opposite plant
   strategies, as observed previously: one dominates primary productivity
   in absence of grazing. the another could play an important role in pp
   restoration at a micro patch scale in heavy grazed sites.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing livestock in streams and associated riparian zones may
   negatively impact a variety of wildlife through direct disturbance and
   alteration of environmental conditions. To evaluate streambank fencing
   as a management tool, we measured the richness, abundance, and biomass
   of reptile and amphibian species on 10 grazed streams and associated
   riparian areas and 10 similar areas that were recently fenced (1-2 yrs)
   to exclude livestock, during spring and summer of 1998 and 1999. Effects
   of streambank fencing on vegetation, water quality, and
   macroinvertebrate populations also were examined because livestock
   grazing may indirectly impact communities of herpetofauna through their
   influence on these factors. We found no difference in species richness,
   abundance of all species combined, or biomass of herpetofauna between
   fenced and unfenced streams. However, northern queen snakes (Regina
   septemvittata) and eastern garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) were more
   abundant on fenced than unfenced sites. Percent litter cover and
   vertical obstruction were higher on fenced sites, terrestrial
   macroinvertebrate biomass was greater on unfenced sites, and
   water-quality variables did not differ between site types. Although some
   species (e.g., birds) responded quickly (<4 yrs) to streambank fencing,
   it appeared that herpetofauna might require a longer recovery time (>4
   yrs). The length of time since livestock were excluded, dispersal
   ability, reproductive potential, and distance to the nearest remnant
   population may be important factors in reptile and amphibian recovery in
   grazed stream and riparian zones.}},

Abstract = {{Wooded meadows on the Baltic Island of Oland result from traditional
   agricultural management over centuries, which has led to a species-rich
   vegetation with high species diversity. Today. nearly all of these
   meadows have been abandoned and became rapidly overgrown by deciduous
   shrub and tree species forming a closed canopy which resulted in a rapid
   and strong decrease in species numbers of the herb layer. Recent efforts
   aim to restore overgrown wooded meadows by cutting single shrubs and
   trees to open the canopy. However, the effects of abandonment as well as
   of any restoration management in wooded meadows have rarely been
   documented until now. Mechanisms driving succession after restoration
   such as the dispersal potential of the respective species over time and
   space have not been analysed yet. Therefore, a chronosequence was
   studied which included a traditionally managed wooded meadow, an
   overgrown meadow which has been abandoned for more that) 100 yr and a
   meadow which was restored 36 yr ago by cutting and is now grazed. We
   analysed the soil seed bank of the 3 meadows in comparison with the
   established vegetation and endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and
   sheep, After abandonment 87\% of the typical grassland species vanished
   from the established vegetation and were replaced by species
   characteristic of woodland and disturbed grassland communities. The mean
   number of species decreased from 52 species per plot (4 m(2)) to 18
   species. Mean species number and number of seeds in the seed bank
   declined significantly from the traditionally managed to the overgrown
   meadow. Most of the grassland species were assigned to a transient seed
   bank type while only 1/3 could be classified as having a short-term
   persistent seed bank. Thus. restoration of wooded meadows cannot rely on
   the soil seed bank. Endozoochorous seed dispersal by cattle and sheep
   was shown for 15\% of the species with seed densities per 100 g air
   dried dung of 737 and 767. respectively. Movement of animals between
   ancient and restored wooded meadows is recommended since many of the
   species only occurred in low densities and therefore, will probably not
   be found in the dung samples.}},

Abstract = {{The Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis states that the greatest species
   diversity occurs at inter-mediate levels of disturbance because species
   coexistence is maintained at a nonequilibrium state and no strong
   competitor can dominate completely. On the other hand, diversity of
   exotic species is expected to increase with the disturbance magnitude.
   These patterns were tested for in this study, The cover of all vascular
   plants, mosses, and lichens in 1 x 1 m plots across a range of
   disturbance levels was sampled in 11 remnant grasslands within the Aspen
   Parkland Ecoregion of central Alberta, western Canada. The Intermediate
   Disturbance Hypothesis was supported for small-scale within-patch
   diversity for total species richness and Simpson's diversity index.
   Lower species diversity was found in undisturbed and lightly grazed as
   well as in highly disturbed plots. Intermediate levels of disturbance
   had reduced dominance of Festuca hallii (Vasey) Piper and increased
   abundance of most other species; this gave the highest species
   diversity. The species richness and diversity of exotic plant species
   showed a significant positive relationship with the magnitude of the
   disturbance. Understanding relationships between disturbance and plant

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to assess the impact of a pastoral management
   chosen to limit the recent expansion of woodland on a Mediterranean
   mountain on land snail diversity. An additional aim was to acquire
   quantitative data that could be used to identify pasture environments
   from Holocene molluscan assemblages. The work was undertaken at the
   Luberon mountain, Provence, south of France. We used a stratified
   quantitative sampling scheme according to altitude and vegetation
   structure. A total of 80 sites were studied. Large species were
   collected within a 5 x 5-m plot. Small species were extracted from
   litter and surface soil. A standard procedure for site description was
   used based on 35 environmental variables. Grazing pressure was estimated
   according to the impact of grazing on the herb layer. Correspondence
   analysis and canonical correspondence analysis were performed using
   CANOCO 4.0 software. The distribution of land snails is related to
   altitude and grazing intensity. Large patches of grazed grassland
   harbour open country and mountain snail species. Thermophilic open
   ground species are located in grazed grasslands at lower altitude.
   Shade-loving species are present in ungrazed scrublands or in small
   clearings on the upper slopes. The lowest species richness, diversity
   and equitability are associated with large patches of grazed grassland,
   the presence of a continuous cover of short grass reinforcing this
   negative impact on snail diversity. Our study is consistent with similar
   works on land snails or other invertebrates but discordant with
   vegetation studies. A homogeneous grazed herb layer significantly
   reduces snail diversity and abundance. Heterogeneity seems to favour
   snail diversity both at the local and landscape scales. However, sheep
   grazing contributes to the expansion of suitable habitats for rare snail
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The patterns of plant species diversity in herbaceous vegetation
   subjected to various human activities were studied in most of the
   landscape elements in a rural area of Chiba, central Japan. Twenty-eight
   transects were sampled in four types of human management-regime
   (cultivation, trampling, mowing, and abandonment) and were grouped into
   seven vegetation types using TWINSPAN and DCA analyses. The DCA axis 1
   arranged all the transects into a successional order along which biomass
   and the degree of succession increased. Accumulated number of species
   increased in a stepwise pattern along the DCA axis 1, in which the
   dominant plant life-forms were replaced from annuals, to perennials and
   perennials/tree-saplings depending on different management regimes. The
   unique species which were confined to a certain management regime, were
   identified in each site. It is suggested that the coexistence of various
   successional communities under different human management regimes
   enhance regional species diversity through maintaining these unique
   species. Among four types of management regime, mowing sites (especially
   traditional verge meadows) had most abundant unique, rare species
   specially adapted to regular cutting. It is suggested that maintaining
   such traditional mown sites is important to conserve the unique
   biodiversity of the studied area. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We discuss the population biology of two calcareous grassland gentians,
   Gentianella germanica and Gentianopsis ciliata, in relation to the
   habitat management currently practiced in The Netherlands. There, at the
   margin of their range, both species are rare. Gentianella germanica
   persists on six remaining locations, whereas Gentianopsis ciliata, with
   two populations, is nearly extinct. Gentionella germanica is a strict
   biennial, Gentianopsis ciliata an iteroparous perennial. Both species
   depend on insects for seed production and suffer from low insect
   visitation. Pollination experiments in one Dutch population demonstrated
   that Gentianopsis ciliata is self-compatible, but hardly sets any seed
   under natural conditions due to pollen limitation. The low reproductive
   success of both species is partly due to the low pollinator densities at
   their late flowering time, partly caused by the small population size of
   the gentians themselves, and partly a result of mowing too early. The
   latter has destroyed the seed crop of several subsequent years in one
   population of Gentianopsis ciliata and some of Gentianella germanica. In
   Gentianella germanica, the early mowing and low insect visitation seems
   to have resulted in selection of less herkogamous and consequently more
   autofertile individuals. The perspectives for Gentianopsis ciliata are
   currently extremely poor in The Netherlands. Under the present
   circumstances, extinction will most likely occur within 10-20 years.
   Population reinforcement (seeding, artificial cross-pollination with
   nearby populations) should be considered if we want to conserve this
   species. For both gentians, but also of other flagship species of
   nutrient-poor calcareous grasslands, the total grassland area needs to
   be enlarged and must constitute an interconnected network of reserves.
   The traditional management method, sheep grazing, is to be preferred
   over mowing, but only if the flock visits each grassland patch or
   reserve for only a short time of less than a day, and with intervals of
   more than 2 weeks between visits. If mowing is preferred for other
   reasons, it should be done rotationally, and not before October. (C)

Abstract = {{Calcareous grasslands, as extraordinarily species-rich and diverse
   habitats of northern and central Europe, need some management for their
   long-term conservation. Traditionally, they have been used as pastures,
   mainly with sheep, but goats are important, because they mainly browse
   and climb rocks. This study presents a comprehensive approach to the
   conservation of these sites, including the requirements of shepherds,
   which were obtained by a questionnaire, together with autecological
   information on the habitat requirements of species. Grazing is a central
   option, which has to be regulated in timing, intensity and spatial
   distribution, to gain optimum results. Nevertheless, local regulations
   must consider the requirements of the shepherds regarding infrastructure
   and social conditions, so that grazing remains practicable.
   Additionally, sheep-farming on conservation sites is presently
   unprofitable and therefore needs financial support. This support is
   supplied by state subsidies in Bavaria (Vertragsnaturschutzprogramm),
   and in the study area by a lamb-meat sales premium, which allows the
   shepherds to charge higher prices for lamb-meat produced under the
   premium regulations. The success of the overall strategy is only
   possible given a well adjusted interplay of influencing factors. (C)

Abstract = {{Calcareous grasslands are one of the most species-rich habitats and a
   central issue in nature conservation management in Europe. Comparative
   vegetation ecological studies let us suppose that calcareous grasslands
   did not exist before the neolithic age except on small and isolated
   areas such as hilly domes or outcrops in the Jurassic mountains and,
   therefore, they are man-made. Species number increased from the
   neolithic age whereas calcareous grasslands only spread since the Roman
   Empire which is evident from palynological and macrofossil findings. A
   historical analysis of the more recent times showed that the maximum of
   spread was only between the fifteenth and twentieth century, the period
   of large sheep flock migrations and transhumance. However, there were
   many different types of land use beside grazing from which calcareous
   grasslands developed such as alternate husbandry and three field
   rotation system. Practices to establish calcareous grasslands included
   also the sowing of hayseed. During the twentieth century, the number and
   area of calcareous grasslands decreased tremendously due to abandonment
   and afforestation since hay making and especially traditional
   shepherding became more and more uneconomical. Today, calcareous
   grasslands are threatened. Conservation management such as mowing was
   not able to maintain species richness and characteristic species,
   especially indicators of land use history. An integrative approach
   combining historical and socio-economic issues is proposed to maintain
   and to redevelop calcareous grasslands in Europe. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Habitat destruction and fragmentation of remaining habitat are major
   threats to global biodiversity. In this paper, we drew upon data from
   grassland butterflies, legume-feeding herbivores and their parasitoids,
   and the interactions between rape pollen beetles and their paraitoids in
   the agricultural landscapes of Germany to explore the following issues:
   (1) the relative importance of small habitat fragments for the
   conservation of biodiversity (in contrast to the prevailing arguments in
   favor of large fragments); (2) the disruption of interspecific
   interactions in fragmented habitats and (3) the relative importance of
   the spatial arrangement of habitat fragments in landscapes of different
   complexity.
   The percentage of polyphagous butterfly species and their abundance were
   higher in small than in large calcareous grassland fragments, showing
   the relative importance of the landscape surrounding habitat fragments
   for less specialized species. A landscape perspective is also needed to
   explain why several small fragments supported more butterfly species
   (even when only endangered species were considered) than the same area
   composed of only one or two fragments. Analyses of insects on legumes
   showed trophic-level differences, in that species numbers of
   parasitoids, but not of herbivores, benefited from habitat subdivision
   in landscapes. As percentage of parasitism (i.e., the strength of
   ecological interactions) increased with fragment area, both the
   ``several small{''} and ``single large{''} strategies appeared to have
   merit. An intermediate-fragmentation strategy of habitat conservation in
   human-dominated landscapes may combine the advantages. Small habitat
   fragments should be scattered enough to cover a range of geographical
   area wide enough to maximize beta diversity and the spreading of but
   with large habitat fragments close enough to enable dispersal among
   fragments, to reduce the extinction probability of area-sensitive
   species, and to stabilize predator-prey interactions.
   Parasitism of rape pollen beetles exhibited a distinct edge effect: it
   was higher near the crop field edge, i.e., near the parasitoids'
   overwintering sites (such as grassy strips). However, this was only true
   in landscape, dominated by annual crops in landscapes with a high
   percentage of permanent noncrop area (>20\%), such edge effects
   disappeared, presumably because of the high overall density or these
   parasitoids. These data indicate that spatial configuration is important
   to mitigate extinction risks when habitat availability in a landscape is
   low, whereas no effect will be observed when overall area of habitat is
   high.}},

Abstract = {{1. Enhancement of plant species diversity is often an objective in

   species germinated in the autumn. Short- and long-term persistent seed
   banks were most abundant. The species composition of the seed banks and
   the vegetation in the trial, and in the traditionally managed meadows
   used as a control, were distinctly different, the meadow trial seed bank
   being the most uniform.
   4. An ordination of simulated plant communities based on the UK National
   Vegetation Classification provided a wider framework for comparing
   vegetation and seed banks with the species composition of British meadow
   communities, some of which are also found in Europe. The soil seed banks
   throughout the meadow trial plots and the control fields were very
   similar in species composition to that of the vegetation in
   agriculturally improved meadows. However, there were many more species
   in the soil seed bank of the traditionally managed control meadows.
   5. In 2000, only the seed-addition treatment increased the species
   richness of the vegetation. Farmyard manure and mineral fertilizer had
   similar effects, increasing the cover of Poa trivialis and Rumex acetosa
   and decreasing the cover of Rhinanthus minor and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
   6. It was concluded that the development of the soil seed bank probably
   lags behind increases in vegetation diversity initiated by seed sowing.
   This emphasizes the need to introduce additional species as seed when
   increased diversity is a target for the restoration management of
   previously intensively managed grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{1. Agricultural intensification has resulted in the reduction and
   fragmentation of species-rich grasslands across much of western Europe.
   2. We examined the key ecological processes that limit the creation of
   diverse grassland communities on ex-arable land in a multi-site
   experiment over a wide variety of soil types and locations throughout
   lowland Britain.
   3. The results showed it was possible to create and maintain these
   communities successfully under a hay-cutting and grazing management
   regime. Furthermore, there was a high degree of repeatability of the
   treatment effects across the sites.
   4. Lack of seed of desirable species was the key factor limiting the
   assembly of diverse grassland communities. Sowing a species-rich seed
   mixture of ecologically adapted grassland plants was an effective means
   of overcoming this limitation. Community assembly by natural
   colonization from the seed bank and seed rain was a slow and unreliable
   process. However, there was no evidence to suggest that sowing a
   species-poor grass-dominated seed mixture made the vegetation any less
   susceptible to colonization by desirable species than allowing natural
   regeneration to take place.
   5. Deep cultivation caused significant reductions in soil P and K
   concentrations across the sites. This had a significant beneficial
   effect on the establishment and persistence of sown forbs in all years.
   It also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of unsown
   weedy grasses. However, for both variables these differences were very
   small after 4 years.
   6. Sowing a nurse crop significantly reduced the number of unsown grass
   species, but had no beneficial effect on the establishment of desirable
   species.
   7. Treatments sown with the species-rich seed mixture following deep
   cultivation corresponded most closely to the specified target
   communities defined by the UK National Vegetation Classification.
   Natural regeneration and treatments sown with the species-poor seed
   mixture were much less similar to the target. The sites on
   circum-neutral soils achieved the greatest degree of similarity to the
   target. Those on calcareous and acid soils failed to achieve their
   targets and most closely resembled the target for neutral soils. This
   reflected the poor performance of the sown preferential species for
   these communities.}},

Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1 We evaluated the responses of native grassland sods to a variety of
   types of disturbance in order to assess hypotheses about the competitive
   effects of established vegetation on seed germination and seedling
   establishment. In particular, we consider whether germination is more
   responsive to the magnitude and duration of vegetation removal
   (competitive release) or to individual disturbance types (specific
   effects).
   2 Field-collected sods of coastal tallgrass prairie were subjected to no
   manipulation, cutting with clippings left, cutting with clippings
   removed (hayed), burning, and complete destruction of established
   vegetation under greenhouse conditions. The emergence and fate of
   seedlings, as well as light penetration through the canopy, were
   followed for a period of 4.5 months.
   3 Total seedling emergence increased from cut to control, hayed, burned
   and plants-removed treatments. Several periods of increased seedling
   emergence suggested responses to both light penetration and seasonal
   change.
   4 Species richness was lowest in cut sods and highest in sods that had
   plants removed or were burned. Rarefaction analysis showed that these
   differences were largely those expected from differences in seedling
   number, except for the cut treatment, which produced fewer species per
   seedling than other treatments.
   5 Indicator species analysis and ordination methods revealed that
   seedling community composition overlapped strongly across all
   treatments, although the area of ordination space did increase with
   increasing numbers of seedlings.
   6 Overall, most of the effects of disturbance could be explained by
   cumulative light penetration to the soil surface, an indicator of total
   competitive release, although a few specific effects could be found
   (particularly for the cutting treatment). Thus, these results generally
   support the competitive release hypothesis.}},

Abstract = {{We evaluated the effectiveness of Triclopyr (Garlon 3A and 4((R))) for
   reducing the cover of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Miller), an invasive
   perennial plant species from the Mediterranean region, in grasslands on
   Santa Cruz Island, California, USA. We used a split-plot design to test
   how herbicide efficacy varied among three factors: the combination of
   herbicide formulation (ester or amine) and its concentration (3.3, 4.5,
   and 6.0 lb 100 gal(-1) water), whether an area was cut or not cut prior
   to herbicide application, and the season of herbicide application (dry
   or wet season). Over three years, fennel cover was reduced between 50\%
   to 90\% in the treated subplots. The most important factor that reduced
   fennel cover was spraying during the wet season (late February-early
   March). Fennel cover was lower in plots where we applied the highest
   concentration of herbicide, although this effect varied among years.
   Subplots sprayed during the dry season with the amine formulation had
   significantly lower fennel cover than those sprayed with the ester
   formulation, but the difference was small and not meaningful for
   management purposes. Cutting prior to herbicide application did not lead
   to a greater reduction in fennel cover, which we attributed to cut
   stalks intercepting herbicide. If cutting is used for site preparation,
   spraying should be done when the new growth of fennel is taller than the
   downed cane. Cover and species richness of native grasses and forbs
   increased significantly in treatment plots over the three-year period,
   but alien grasses and forbs still comprised > 90\% of the cover in these
   plots. Triclopyr was effective at reducing fennel, but other restoration
   techniques (prescribed burning, seeding, plantings) may be necessary to
   enhance the habitat for native plant species following fennel removal.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of grazing disturbance on insect communities were examined
   at a montane grassland in Central Argentina, by comparing two grazed
   sites differing in cattle load (heavy and continuous or moderate and
   discontinuous) and two cattle exclusions differing in age (7 and 19
   years). Two aspects of insect diversity (taxonomic and guild structure)
   and two levels of taxonomic resolution (family and species) were
   considered. Four monthly samples were taken with a suction sampler in
   two 1 m(2) areas at each site. Collected specimens were counted,
   identified to family (all insects) or species (Coleoptera) level, and
   allocated to trophic guilds. Abundance, richness, diversity and biomass
   of the insect assemblages had minimum values in the most intensely
   grazed habitat, which also differed from the other sites in terms of
   insect families and Coleoptera species composition. It also showed a
   distinct guild structure, with fewer secondary consumers, and chewers
   replacing suckers as the most abundant herbivore group. According to
   these observations, intense grazing in montane grasslands in Central
   Argentina could result in taxonomic and guild changes in the associated
   insect communities, but such effects would not be noticeable with less
   intensive use. Moreover, using family taxonomic level could be as or
   even more appropriate than species level in order to characterize insect
   communities in the studied habitats under varying disturbance regimes.}},

Abstract = {{Subalpine meadows, which traditionally were mown every other year, are
   particularly rich in plant species, especially forbs. Near Davos
   (Switzerland) we compared the vegetation of mown sites with that of
   sites grazed for up to 50 years by non-lactating cows. We recorded an
   overall mean of 51.5 plant species per 4x4 in plot. Among grazed sites,
   evenness decreased with time since conversion to grazing (-0.11 in 50
   years; P<0.05), suggesting progressive vegetation change, which may
   eventually result in the loss of species. Ground cover by forbs tended
   to be higher in mown than in grazed sites (by 7.2\%; P<0.1). The
   proportion of not-clonally colonising perennial species decreased after
   conversion to grazing (-7.72\%; in 50 years, P<0.05), while the cover by
   graminoid species increased (+14.2\% in 50 years; P<0.1). More
   intensively grazed sites had a lower cover of dwarf shrubs and higher
   cover of legume species (P<0.05). Because grazing negatively affects
   both botanical richness and agricultural quality, mowing of
   traditionally mown subalpine meadows should be maintained, and recently
   grazed meadows should be reconverted to mowing. (C) 2002 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Grasslands of alluvial systems were studied in 35 valleys from the
   Mackenzie Basin in Canterbury to Marlborough in eastern South Island,
   New Zealand, to describe the relationship between environmental factors
   and vegetation types and gradients. Pastoral modification, represented
   by decreasing percentage of native species, was the primary determinant
   of the overall vegetation pattern. The least modified vegetation types.
   retaining native tussock canopies, were recorded on low pH,
   organic-rich, phosphate-poor soils, in higher-rainfall reaches of
   valleys experiencing low summer temperatures. Secondary vegetation
   gradients, from Festuca matthewsii and red tussock grasslands to Festuca
   novae-zelandiae grasslands, corresponded with trends from mesic
   intermontane to drier, more continental rainshadow climates, and from
   low-lying floodplains to elevated terraces. The effects of grazing, and
   of the cessation of grazing, were examined at fenceline and exclosure
   sites. The abundance and abundance fraction of native species had
   decreased over time with grazing at all fenceline sites, and native
   species richness and native richness fraction had decreased at two
   sites. Grazing-exclosed vegetation had higher native biomass than
   adjacent grazed vegetation at three sites, and higher percentages of
   native species richness at three sites. The presence or absence of
   native tussock grasses at the time of exclosure may be critical for
   post-pastoral retention or recovery of native biomass. Trends along
   climate and modification gradients in the occurrence of three major
   introduced species were compared between valley groups. Agrostis
   capillaris appears to have reached its potential environmental range in
   most of the studied valleys. However, Festuca rubra and Hieracium
   pilosella may not yet occupy their potential range in the North and
   South Hurunui valleys in Canterbury, and in the Ahuriri, Hopkins, and
   Dobson valleys in the Mackenzie region.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of the canopy of small-sized seagrasses (Cymodocea nodosa
   and Zostera noltii) to fish assemblages was investigated in experimental
   plots at three shallow sites in NE Sardinia (Italy, western
   Mediterranean). Fish were assessed by underwater visual census in four
   habitats: (1) seagrass in its natural state, (2) cut seagrass, (3) uncut
   seagrass (with a simulation in time and effort equivalent to those spent
   at the treated patches) and (4) unvegetated sand. The disturbance
   associated with removing seagrass canopies was not found to affect fish.
   Multivariate analyses showed that fish assemblages from seagrass
   habitats, with seagrass patches removed and unvegetated sand differed
   significantly among each other. Univariate analyses revealed that
   species richness, total fish abundance, and densities of Atherinidae,
   Diplodus sargus and Sarpa salpa were unaffected by the habitat type. The
   seagrass leaf canopy was most important for Symphodus ocellatus, Labrus
   viridis, Diplodus annularis and Sparus aurata, the last three species
   being chiefly represented by small-sized fishes. Gobiids were most
   abundant in habitats devoid of seagrass vegetation (i.e. sand and
   removed patches), while Coris julis and Diplodus vulgaris appeared to
   prefer unvegetated sand, even compared with the removed patches. Other
   species, such as Symphodus cinereus, Symphodus tinca and Mullus
   surmuletus, did not display any distinct distribution patterns
   attributable to the habitat type. For a number of littoral fish species,
   including some of commercial importance (e.g. S. aurata), small-sized
   seagrasses in NE Sardinia were thus demonstrated to exert an ecological
   role, which involves important implications for the protection and
   management of these coastal habitats and suggests the need for further
   research at larger spatial scales.}},

Title = {{Faunal and environmental change in the late Miocene Siwaliks of northern
   Pakistan}},

Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{The Siwalik formations of northern Pakistan consist of deposits of
   ancient rivers that existed throughout the early Miocene through the
   late Pliocene. The formations are highly fossiliferous with a diverse
   array of terrestrial and freshwater vertebrates, which in combination
   with exceptional lateral exposure and good chronostratigraphic control
   allows a more detailed and temporally resolved study of the sediments
   and faunas than is typical in terrestrial deposits. Consequently the
   Siwaliks provide an opportunity to document temporal differences in
   species richness, turnover, and ecological structure in a terrestrial
   setting, and to investigate how such differences are related to changes
   in the fluvial system, vegetation, and climate. Here we focus on the
   interval between 10.7 and 5.7 Ma, a time of significant local tectonic
   and global climatic change. It is also the interval with the best
   temporal calibration of Siwalik faunas and most comprehensive data on
   species occurrences. A methodological focus of this paper is on
   controlling sampling biases that confound biological and ecological
   signals. Such biases include uneven sampling through time, differential
   preservation of larger animals and more durable skeletal elements,
   errors in age-dating imposed by uncertainties in correlation and
   paleomagnetic timescale calibrations, and uneven taxonomic treatment
   across groups. We attempt to control for them primarily by using a
   relative-abundance model to estimate limits for the first and last
   appearances from the occurrence data. This model also incorporates
   uncertainties in a e estimates. Because of sampling limitations inherent
   in the terrestrial fossil record, our 100-Kyr temporal resolution may
   approach the finest possible level of resolution for studies of
   vertebrate faunal changes over periods of millions of years.
   Approximately 40,000 specimens from surface and screenwash collections
   made at 555 localities form the basis of our study. Sixty percent of the
   localities have maximum and minimum age estimates differing by 100 Kyr
   or less, 82\% by 200 Kyr or less. The fossils represent 115 mammalian
   species or lineages of ten orders: Insectivora, Scandentia, Primates,
   Tubulidentata, Proboscidea, Pholidota, Lagomorpha, Perissodactyla,
   Artiodactyla, and Rodentia. Important taxa omitted from this study
   include Carnivora, Elephantoidea, and Rhinocerotidae. Because different
   collecting methods were used for large and small species, they are
   treated separately in analyses. Small species include insectivores, tree
   shrews, rodents, lagomorphs, and small primates. They generally weigh
   less than 5 kg.
   The sediments of the study interval were deposited by coexisting fluvial
   systems, with the larger emergent Nagri system being displaced between
   10.1 and 9.0 Ma by an interfan Dhok Pathan system. In comparison to
   Nagri floodplains, Dhok Pathan floodplains were less well drained, with
   smaller rivers having more seasonally variable flow and more frequent
   avulsions. Paleosol sequences indicate reorganization of topography and
   drainage accompanying a transition to a more seasonal climate. A few
   paleosols may have formed under waterlogged, grassy woodlands, but most
   formed under drier conditions and more closed vegetation.
   The oxygen isotopic record also indicates significant change in the
   patterns of precipitation beginning at 9.2 Ma, in what may have been a
   shift to a drier and more seasonal climate. The carbon isotope record
   demonstrates that after 8.1 Ma significant amounts of C-4 grasses began
   to appear and that by 6.8 Ma floodplain habitats included extensive C-4
   grasslands. Plant communities with predominantly C-4 plants were greatly
   diminished after 7.0 Ma, and those with predominantly C-4 plants, which
   would have been open woodlands or grassy woodlands, appeared as early as
   7.4 Ma.
   Inferred first and last appearances show a constant, low level of faunal
   turnover throughout the interval 10.7-5.7-Ma, with three short periods
   of elevated turnover at 10.3, 7.8, and 7.3-7.0 Ma. The three pulses
   account for nearly 44\% of all turnover. Throughout the late Miocene,
   species richness declined steadily, and diversity and richness indices
   together with data on body size imply that community ecological
   structure changed abruptly just after 10 Ma, and then again at 7.8 Ma.
   Between 10 and 7.8 Ma the large-mammal assemblages were strongly
   dominated by equids, with more balanced faunas before and after. The
   pattern of appearance and disappearance is selective with respect to
   inferred habits of the animals. Species appearing after 9.0 Ma are
   grazers or typical of more open habitats, whereas many species that
   disappear can be linked to more closed vegetation. We presume exceptions
   to this pattern were animals of the mixed C-3/C-4 communities or the
   wetter parts of the floodplain that did not persist into the latest
   Miocene. The pace of extinction accelerates once there is C-4 vegetation
   on the floodplain.
   The 10.3 Ma event primarily comprises disappearance of taxa that were
   both common and of long duration. The event does not correlate to any
   obvious local environmental or climatic event, and the pattern of
   species disappearance and appearance suggests that biotic interactions
   may have been more important than environmental change. The 7.8 Ma event
   is characterized solely by appearances, and that at 7.3 Ma by a
   combination of appearances and disappearances. These two latest Miocene
   events include more taxa that were shorter ranging and less common, a
   difference of mode that developed between approximately 9.0 and 8.5 Ma
   when many short-ranging and rare species began to make appearances. Both
   events also show a close temporal correlation to changes in floodplain
   deposition and vegetation.
   The 7.8 Ma event follows the widespread appearance of C-4 vegetation and
   is coincident with the shift from equid-dominated to more evenly
   balanced large-mammal assemblages, The 7.3 to 7.0 Ma event starts with
   the first occurrence of C-4-dominated floras and ends with the last
   occurrence of C dominated vegetation. Absence of a consistent
   relationship between depositional facies and the composition of faunal
   assemblages leads us to reject fluvial system dynamics as a major cause
   of faunal change. The close correlation of latest Miocene species
   turnover and ecological change to expansion of C-4 plants on the
   floodplain, in association with oxygen isotopic and sedimentological
   evidence for increasingly drier and more seasonal climates, causes us to
   favor explanations based on climatic change for both latest Miocene
   pulses.
   The Siwalik record supports neither ``coordinated stasis{''} nor
   ``turnover pulse{''} evolutionary models. The brief, irregularly spaced
   pulses of high turnover are characteristic of both the Stasis and pulse
   models, but the high level of background turnover that eliminates
   65-70\% of the initial species shows there is no stasis in the Siwalik
   record. In addition, the steadily declining species richness and abrupt,
   uncoordinated changes in diversity do not fit either model.}},

Abstract = {{Floating fens are species-rich succession stages in fen areas in the
   Netherlands. Many of these fens are deteriorating due to acidification;
   Sphagnum species and Polytrichum commune build 10-25 cm thick moss
   carpets, and the species diversity decreases. Earlier experiments in wet
   ecosystems indicate that successful restoration of circum-neutral and
   mesotrophic conditions requires a combination of hydrological measures
   and sod removal. In an acidified fen recharged by rainwater in the
   nature reserve Ilperveld (The Netherlands), a ditch/trench system was
   dug for the purpose of creating a run-off channel for acid rainwater in
   wet periods and to enable circum-neutral surface water to enter the fen
   in dry periods. Moreover, the sod was removed in part of the fen.
   Ditch/trench creation or sod cutting had no effect individually, but a
   combination of the two measures led to a change in the abiotic
   conditions (higher pH and Ca), and in turn to an increase of
   species-richness and the reestablishment of a number of characteristic
   species. Reestablishment of rare vascular plant species and
   characteristic bryophytes might be a long-term process because of
   incomplete recovery of site conditions and constraints in seed
   dispersal.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Secondary succession in wet grasslands has received surprisingly little
   attention. We analyzed the vegetation of a eutrophic alluvial wetland of
   western France and the relationship between its composition and
   environmental variables. The objectives of our study were twofold: (1)
   to describe species assemblages of wet grasslands and oldfields and
   correlate their species composition to hydrologic stress and (2) to
   study the changes in species composition, species richness, and species
   diversity when mowed meadows are abandoned. More than 100 species were
   recorded, and five species assemblages ('A' to `E') were identified.
   Hydrology and land use (mowing versus land abandonment) were the two
   main ecological factors that affected plant community development.
   Hydrologic regime contributed to separate `A'. `B' (on the wettest end
   of the gradient) from `C', `D', and `E' (on the driest end of the
   gradient). Land use helped to discriminate `B'. `C' from `A, `D' and
   `E'. Larger-scale disturbances such as mowing maintain meadow species,
   leading to a high level of species richness, species diversity, and
   evenness. We compared the species richness, species diversity, and
   evenness according to the duration of land abandonment since last mowing
   disturbances (<5 years, 6-10 years, 11-15 years, 16-20 years). No
   significant differences were observed. Botanical composition of these
   plots did not differ significantly. In the first five years of land
   abandonment, there was an increase of litter, which reduces the species
   richness, diversity, and evenness. Live, above-ground biomass of
   grasslands was significantly greater than that of oldfields, but total
   organic matter (biomass + litter) was significantly greater for
   oldfields than for grasslands, Total biomass showed a negative
   logarithmic relationship with species richness. with species richness
   being initially high at very low standing crop levels (grasslands) and
   decreasing at greater levels of standing crop (oldfields).}},

Abstract = {{This study tested the applicability of Island Biogeographic Theory to
   arthropod assemblages on `islands' of creosotebush (Larrea tridentata)
   across a desert shrubland-grassland ecotone in central New Mexico,
   U.S.A. We assumed that herbivorous arthropod taxa that specialize on
   creosotebush view these shrubs as `islands' of suitable habitat in a
   `sea' of grassland, and used the Island Biogeographic Theory to examine
   the observed plant and arthropod patterns. Specifically, we addressed
   predictions concerning the relationship among arthropod species richness
   and (1) shrub `island' area, (2) distance between `island' and
   `continent', and (3) `island' isolation. Using a pyrethrum insecticide,
   we defaunated 36 shrubs within three ecotonal areas (12 shrubs per
   area), defined as `continental' (high shrub density), `archipelago'
   (medium shrub density, close to the `continent'), and `oceanic' (low
   shrub density, far from the `continent'). We assessed the initial
   arthropod distribution and then repeated the defaunation after two weeks
   to assess immigration patterns. The arthropods from both samples were
   catalogued and related to `island area' (shrub volume), `island'
   distance from the defined `continent', and `island' isolation (density).
   We found that in the initial sample, specialist herbivore species
   richness was (1) positively related to shrub volume, (2) negatively
   related to shrub distance from the `continent', but (3) not
   significantly related to shrub density. Following the recolonization
   period, we found that specialist herbivore species richness was again
   significantly positively related to shrub volume, but was not
   significantly related to shrub distance from the `continent' or to shrub
   density. We also examined the relationship between generalist predator
   arthropod (spiders and mantids) populations and shrub `island'
   characteristics as well as specialist prey abundances on the shrubs. We
   found that predator abundances on individual shrubs were positively
   related to shrub volume prior to and following defaunation, negatively
   related to shrub density both initially and following recolonization,
   and positively related to the architectural complexity of host shrubs
   initially. We also found that predator population sizes on shrubs were
   positively correlated with abundances of specialist prey species. We
   concluded that our model conformed fully to the species richness-island
   area and species richness-island distance relationships of Island
   Biogeographic Theory, but only in part to the species richness-island
   isolation relationship. We also found that species-specific dispersal
   ability was a critical factor with regard to the observed species
   distribution patterns. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.}},

   effects of mechanical overstory reduction and slash treatment

Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Although the distribution and structure of pinyon-juniper woodlands in
   the southwestern United States are thought to be the result of historic
   fluctuations in regional climatic conditions, more recent increases in
   the areal extent, tree density, soil erosion rates and loss of
   understory plant diversity are attributed to heavy grazing by domestic
   livestock and interruption of the natural fire regime. Prior to 1850,
   many areas currently occupied by high-density pinyon-juniper woodlands,
   with their degraded soils and depauperate understories, were very likely
   savannas dominated by native grasses and forbs and containing sparse
   tree cover scattered across the landscape. The purpose of this study was
   to evaluate the effectiveness of mechanical overstory reduction and
   three slash treatment alternatives (removal, clustering and scattering)
   followed by prescribed fire as techniques for restoring grassland
   savannas from degraded woodlands. Plant cover, diversity, biomass and
   nutrient status, litter cover and soil chemistry and erosion rates were
   measured prior to and for two years following experimental treatment in
   a degraded pinyon-juniper woodland in central New Mexico. Treatment
   resulted in a significant increase in the cover of native grasses and,
   to a lesser degree, forbs and shrubs. Plant species richness and
   diversity increased most on sites where slash was either completely
   removed or scattered to serve as a mulch. Although no changes in soil
   chemistry or plant nutrient status were observed, understory biomass
   increased over 200\% for all harvest treatments and was significantly
   greater than controls. While treatment increased litter cover and
   decreased soil exposure, this improvement did not significantly affect
   soil loss rates. Even though all slash treatment alternatives increased
   the cover and biomass of native grasses, scattering slash across the
   site to serve as a mulch appears most beneficial to improving plant
   species diversity and conserving site resources. (C) 2002 Elsevier

   compared. Three taxonomic assemblages were studied: (1) vascular plants
   only, (2) bryophytes also included, (3) terrestrial lichens included as
   well. Using a multivariate approach, both species richness and evenness
   could best be explained when only vascular plants were considered,
   emphasizing the role of taxonomic restrictions. The models best
   explaining species richness merely required abiotic conditions. This
   supports recent theories emphasizing the importance of an environmental
   regulation of the pool of (adapted) species from which the actual
   species are recruited. Explanatory soil properties were moisture and pH
   (both unimodal), and the soil available N:P ratio. Plots with large
   perimeter:area ratios had significantly more species than those with low
   ratios, indicating the importance of consistency in quadrat shape.
   Hump-shaped species richness relationships could be identified for both
   standing biomass and productivity, but they explained only a small part
   of the variation and were apparent only if soil and management effects
   were not accounted for. Unimodality (and notably the decreasing phase)
   was most pronounced when using maximum standing biomass, suggesting that
   the key factor is competition for light. At intermediate levels of
   standing biomass, the positive effects of habitat productivity and the
   negative effects of standing biomass itself are in balance, and high
   species numbers may be expected. When soil or management variables were
   allowed in the models, hump-shaped biomass relationships were no longer
   confirmed, suggesting that such relationships may arise from the
   covariation of biomass with other factors. Management explained a much
   larger part of the variation than the hump-shaped biomass relationship,
   suggesting that mowing and hay removal (both showing independent
   positive effects) regulate species richness in ways other than solely
   through the control of maximum standing biomass. Significantly higher
   evenness values were obtained at sites with low maximum biomass values,
   but only for the vascular plants. In addition, species evenness was
   positively related to the frequency of mowing. The numbers of both rare
   and endangered species were strongly curtailed by high standing biomass
   values, suggesting that these species are more susceptible to
   competitive exclusion than others. Through direct as well as indirect
   effects, management is confirmed to be beneficial not only for general
   species richness, but also for the occurrence of rare and endangered
   species.}},

Abstract = {{The practice of continuously grazing cattle along streams has caused
   extensive degradation of riparian habitats. Buffer strips and managed
   intensive rotational grazing (MIRG) have been proposed to protect and
   restore stream ecosystems in Wisconsin. However, the ecological
   implications of a switch from traditional livestock management to MIRG
   or buffer strip establishment have not been investigated. Differences in
   small mammal communities associated with riparian areas on continuously
   grazed and MIRG pastures, as well as vegetative buffer strips adjacent
   to raw crops, were investigated in southwestern Wisconsin during
   May-September 1997 and 1998. More species (mean of 6-7) were found on
   the buffer sites than on the pasture sites (mean of 2-5). Total small
   mammal abundance on buffer sites was greater than on the pastures as
   well; there were 3-5 times as many animals on the buffer sites compared
   to the pasture sites, depending on year. There were no differences in
   species richness or total abundance between MIRG and continuously grazed
   pastures in either year. Total small mammal abundance was greater near
   the stream than away from the stream, regardless of farm management
   practice but there were no differences in species richness. Buffer
   strips appear to support a particularly rich and abundant small mammal
   community. Although results did not detect a difference in small mammal
   use between pasture types, farm-wide implications of a conversion from
   continuous to MIRG styles of grazing may benefit small mammals
   indirectly by causing an increase in the prevalence of pasture in the
   agricultural landscape. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The seed banks of two delta meadows were studied on the west coast of
   Finland (61degrees33-N, 21degrees39-21degrees41'E) to evaluate the
   possibilities of using seed bank in the restoration of coastal wetland
   meadows. The objective of the study was to determine the size,
   composition and species richness of germinable seed bank, estimate the
   effect of flooding on the seed bank, and describe the similarities and
   differences between seed bank and the aboveground vegetation. The study
   areas are conservationally important. A total of 125 samples were taken
   with a corer of 4.8 cm in diameter to the depth of 10 cm. Altogether
   4977 seedlings were observed, yielding an average of 22 005+/-1880
   seedlings/m(2). Most seedlings and species in the seed bank were
   monocotyledons, perennials and hemicryptophytes, similar to the
   aboveground vegetation. Although 36 species were found in both the seed
   bank and vegetation, there was a significant lack of similarity overall
   (Mantel test). The seed bank flora included 24 dicot vs. 25 monocot
   species and 41 perennial vs. 8 annual species. Many of the species found
   only in the seed bank were annuals or biennials (13 species, 46\% of
   total) and those growing only in the aboveground vegetation were mainly
   perennials (52 species, 92\% of total). The most abundant species found
   in the seed bank were Carex nigra, C. aquatilis, Juncus gerardii, Calla
   palustris, and Potentilla palustris, which together made up 74\% of the
   seed bank. The numbers of species differed significantly between
   different elevation classes and were highest at middle elevations. Seed
   bank is an important part of these delta grassland communities and can
   be utilised in restoration.}},

Title = {{How many trees make a forest? Cultural debates about vegetation change
   in Australia}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2002}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{375-389}},
Abstract = {{Environmental history, as it has emerged in recent years, is most
   distinctive in the way it illustrates a serious engagement between the
   disciplines of ecology and history. This article begins with an
   exploration of the lineage and promise of environmental history,
   particularly in the Australian setting. It then analyses a number of the
   cultural debates about vegetation change in Australia-about clearing,
   open landscapes, scrub encroachment and burning practices-and draws
   attention to the way that morals, politics and aesthetics shaped
   environmental perception and still do. Clearing was the dominant
   discourse in the history of landscape change and a legislative
   requirement for secure settlement. At the same time, criticism of
   clearing and its effects represented an early conservationist
   sensibility, but the heroic pioneering labour of clearing, the political
   imperatives associated with it and the escalating ecological legacy it
   generated, have sometimes made us forget how open was much of the
   Australian landscape when Europeans first arrived. The morality of
   clearing-the arguments for and against-focused the minds of settlers on
   the trees and the loss of them, while the aesthetics of pastoralism
   attracted their eyes to the grasslands and made them rejoice in the
   curious legacy of `open' landscapes. In the early nineteenth century,
   the most common usage of the word `forest' was to describe land fit to
   graze: `according to the local distinction, the grass is the
   discriminating character {[}of forest land] and not the Trees'. At the
   same time, pastoralists were unwilling to recognise the role of
   Aboriginal people in creating such open landscapes and this reticence to
   acknowledge the Aboriginality of the pastoral economy persists today.
   This in turn affected the way settlers perceived the new forests that
   appeared after European invasion. The fate of the vegetation Europeans
   found has understandably been so much the focus of science and
   history-its removal, replacement, utilisation, modification and
   conservation-that `new forests' easily escape scholarly attention; and
   being new, they seem far less valuable and threatened. They have
   generally been perceived as a nuisance, as enclosing and encroaching, as
   `scrub', as `woody weeds'. The politics of understanding regrowth are
   related not only to the issues of clearing and density, but especially
   to the culture of burning in Aboriginal and settler society and its
   implications for management and biodiversity.
   If the coming together of ecology and history best defines the new
   `environmental history', then the most illuminating confluences are
   those where each discipline helps the other to identify what constitutes
   a unique, event', both ecologically and historically. The article
   therefore finishes with examples of events in two landscapes-the long
   drought of the 1890s in western New South Wales and the Black Friday
   bushfires of 1939 in the mountain ash forests of Victoria-to illustrate
   how each emerges as an intriguing artefact of nature and history, a
   cultural exaggeration of a natural rhythm. Even as we discover the
   ecological depth of each apparently `natural' event, are reminded of its
   historical specificity.}},

Pages = {{221-227}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to determine effects of elevated CO2 and
   soil nutrient availability on growth and plant tissue quality in four
   grass species, Agrostis stolonifera, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca
   rubra and Poa pratensis, native in Western European calcareous
   grassland. Plants were grown for 65 days in the greenhouse in pots with
   untreated soil from calcareous grassland under ambient (350 ppm) and
   elevated (700 ppm) CO2 either with or without fertilisation. In general,
   elevated CO2 increased plant height, total biomass, starch and sugar
   concentrations, and decreased water and nitrogen concentrations.
   However, the response to CO2-enrichment depended strongly on the grass
   species investigated. Fertilisation enhanced most effects of elevated
   CO2 Biomass production in fertilised plants increased more under
   elevated CO2 than in unfertilised plants whereas leaf nitrogen
   concentration of fertilised plants decreased more at elevated CO2 than
   it did in unfertilised plants. Furthermore, a species-specific response
   to elevated CO2, depending on soil nutrient availability was detected in
   starch and sugar concentrations (three-way interaction). The data from
   this study indicate that grass species vary in their response to
   elevated CO2 in biomass production and tissue quality. Furthermore,
   increasing nutrient availability can substantially alter effects of
   elevated CO2. Since the investigated grass species are important larval
   food-plants of insect herbivores on calcareous grassland, the observed
   species-specific reactions to CO2-enrichment and high nutrient
   availability in tissue quantity and quality are discussed with respect
   to their effects on insect performance and thus abundance and
   biodiversity of these insects.}},

Abstract = {{Declines in (lie natural populations of several bumblebee species across
   Britain and Europe are an increasing cause for concern. In this study
   the habitat use of bumblebees was investigated on Salisbury Plain
   Training Area, the largest remaining area of unimproved chalk grassland
   in north-west Europe. Habitat characteristics influencing the overall
   abundance, species richness and foraging activity of bumblebees included
   the diversity and abundance of flowering plant species (particularly of
   favoured forage plants such as Trifolium pratense), vegetation structure
   and height. It is suggested that different Bombus species respond to
   these habitat characteristics depending on their specific foraging and
   nesting requirements, the case of Bombus humilis being especially
   relevant. The effects of several grassland management practices were
   considered in terms of their suitability for the conservation of
   bumblebee habitats. Cattle grazing was shown to be preferable to both
   sheep grazing and the absence of any management, although the timing and
   intensity of such grazing was important. Small-scale disturbances caused
   by vehicle activity were also of value in producing locally abundant
   forage resources in less intensively managed grasslands. (C) 2001

   functioning, but little is known about long-term dynamic consequences of
   disturbance. Here, we show that a major drought perturbed prairie
   grassland from nearly constant average annual production, and induced 9
   years of oscillations with a 2-year period. This pattern occurred in
   unmanipulated plots in man. widely separated fields that were part of
   two different long-term studies. Using direct and indirect tests, we
   could reject the hypothesis that the oscillations were externally
   imposed by climate or herbivores. Weak evidence supported the hypothesis
   that oscillations were internally generated, caused by a litter and
   nitrogen dependent feedback on productivity, This hypothesis was
   supported by the results of two other long-term studies, in which
   burning and, separately, nitrogen addition eliminated the 2-year
   oscillations in plant production. However, more direct evidence failed
   to support the litter hypothesis. A final, but untested hypothesis was
   suggested by the observation that production tended to be synchronized
   amongst dominant plants. Drought may have synchronized production
   dynamics amongst plant,; with biennially greater allocation to
   above-ground growth. Regardless of the specific mechanism, our results
   show that a single disturbance may have long-lasting effects on the
   dynamics of plant production.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the species composition of vegetation and seed bank in an
   experiment with grassland and oldfield plots in an eutrophic alluvial
   wetland (called ``Marais de Redon{''}) of Western France. In this
   wetland, artificial disturbances (mowing) and natural disturbances
   (cattle, roebucks, boars, voles...) are very frequent. In order to mime
   these natural disturbances, experimental disturbances were generated in
   March 1996 after the end of the winter flooding and the seedlings
   counted three months later. The seed bank, the undisturbed vegetation
   and seedlings emerging in disturbed quadrats were sampled. Detrended
   Correspondence Analysis (DCA) of the undisturbed quadrats, disturbed
   quadrats and seed bank samples showed significant differences of species
   composition. Similarity between seed bank and undisturbed aboveground
   vegetation was low and not very different between grassland and
   oldfield. Very few seedlings emerged in undisturbed vegetation both in
   grassland and oldfield, which indicates the importance of gaps for seed
   bank expression. The great majority of seedlings emerging after
   experimental disturbances were mainly recruited from the soil seed bank.
   This result contrasts with other studies where the seed bank contributed
   very little to the seedling flora and vegetative regrowth clearly
   predominated recolonisation after disturbances. In the seed bank, few
   species lost after succession from grassland to oldfield vegetation were
   still present as seeds in the soil, but in most cases, species lost were
   not recorded in the seed bank. The two hypotheses about changes in the
   seed bank during secondary succession, predicting decrease in species
   richness or species diversity and seed density were only confirmed for
   seed density parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Species richness of annual legumes in step-point transects was analyzed
   for 79 pairs of grazed and ungrazed sites of Mediterranean vegetation in
   northern Israel. Seventy-eight species of annual legumes belonging to 17
   genera were sampled. Species richness of all annual legumes of Medicago
   and Trifolium was significantly greater, by 25-42\%, on the grazed
   compared to the ungrazed site of site-pairs. Legume richness was
   significantly greater on Cretaceous and Eocene sedimentary rocks
   compared to younger Neogene and Pleistocene sediments, with intermediate
   richness on basalt. It was significantly lower in sites with 400-500 mm
   rainfall compared to 500-900 mm, and in wetland compared to grassland,
   shrubland, and woodland. Species richness of annual legumes, Medicago
   and Trifolium, increased significantly from zero or low grazing
   intensity to high intensity. A consistent, not significant reduction of
   species richness was observed at extremely high grazing intensity. Many
   species of small annual legumes increased in cover with grazing
   intensity. Erect or twining species did not show this response. The
   tendency of increased richness of annual legumes with grazing was
   confirmed for subhumid Mediterranean communities, but it may be reversed
   at extremely high grazing intensities, or in semiarid communities grazed
   by sheep, and for some legume taxa. Management for in situ conservation
   of the entire annual legume flora in productive Mediterranean vegetation
   requires, in different parts of the landscape, continuation of intense
   grazing and relative protection from grazing.}},

Journal = {{LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{19-33}},
Abstract = {{The river valley of the French upper Meuse and its floodplain,
   constitutes a relatively natural ecosystem which still contains many
   endangered species of high conservation value. For example, several
   birds (Crex crex, Numenius arquata) as well as plant species (Gratiola
   officinalis, Inula britannica, Teucrium scordium, Ranunculus lingua and
   Mentha pulegium) which have declined seriously in France in recent times
   are found in the upper Meuse floodplain. Phytosociological studies and
   water level measurements have shown that the floristic diversity is
   mainly influenced by hydrological fluctuations and agricultural
   practices. The plant communities are structured along a topographical
   gradient in the high water bed reflecting the duration of floods and the
   ground water table depth. Agricultural practices have influenced the
   vegetation changes by selecting species adapted to particular management
   practices (e.g., fertiliser use, grazing, cutting regime). The data
   collected in this study from the upper Meuse as enabled 13 grassland and
   wetland ecotopes to be defined which are correlated with different
   environmental factors. Fertiliser use, grazing and reduction in the
   frequency of the cutting lead to a lower species richness because they
   encourage competitive species. However, it is also demonstrated, that
   maximum biodiversity is not always synonymous with high conservation
   value because some impoverished ecosystems, e.g., sedges and tall forb
   formations, may contain endangered plant and bird species. Knowledge of
   the boundaries between the different plant communities enables likely
   changes in floristic composition after modification of one or more site
   factors to be forecasted. Such factors include, water table depth and
   flood frequency, cutting regime, fertiliser use and grazing pressure.
   Thus, the definition of these ecotopes, corresponding to correlations
   between water regime, agricultural practice and vegetation composition,
   could lead to the establishment of guidelines for water and agricultural
   managements that could be involved in restoration projects.}},

   Planktivores were the most abundant feeding guild on coral reefs as well

   guilds other than planktivores seems to be strongly influenced by the
   benthic habitat. Multivariate analysis clearly separated disturbed from
   undisturbed sites, whereas univariate measures, such as species
   richness, diversity and evenness did not reveal any negative impact of
   disturbance. The disturbance of the coral reefs led to changes in the

   increased total abundance of herbivorous and detritivorous fishes,
   decreased total abundance of invertebrate- and fish-feeders, and

Abstract = {{Butterfly communities were inventoried at two national parks, Allegheny
   Portage Railroad National Historic Site (ALPO) and Johnstown Flood
   National Memorial (JOFL), Pennsylvania, in 1998. Information on
   presence, abundance, and distribution of butterflies is important to
   National Park Service personnel, who are mandated to manage the
   biodiversity of natural resources. As large tracts of public lands, such
   as national parks, become more insular with increased habitat
   fragmentation. they will become increasingly valuable for the long-term
   maintenance of faunal diversity and the functional integrity of
   ecosystems in the eastern United States. Surveys were conducted monthly
   from late spring to early fall along two transects in ALPO and one in
   JOFL. Twenty-eight butterfly species were noted in the study. At ALPO,
   most species and individuals were found along open (non-wooded) sectors
   of the transects, including Phyciodes tharos (Drury) (Pearl Crescent),
   Boloria bellona (F.) (Meadow Fritillary), and Thymelicus lineola (Ochs.)
   (European Skipper). At JOFL, the most abundant butterfly was T. lineola.
   We observed 27 of 110 flowering plant species being used as nectar
   sources by butterflies on 200 occasions in both parks combined. At both
   parks, an effort should be made to develop mowed lawns into unmowed
   grasslands to increase their use by butterfly species by providing
   habitat for wildflowers (nectar sources).}},

Abstract = {{Several components of the diversity of plant communities, such as
   species richness, species composition, number of functional groups and
   functional composition, have been shown to directly affect the
   performance of exotic species. Exotics can also be affected by
   herbivores of the native plant community. However, these two possible
   mechanisms limiting invasion have never been investigated together. The
   aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between plant
   diversity, herbivory and performance of two annual exotics, Conyza
   bonariensis and C. canadensis, in Mediterranean annual communities. We
   wanted to test whether herbivory of these exotics was influenced either
   by species richness, functional-group richness or functional-group
   composition. We also studied the relationship between herbivory on the
   exotic species and their performance. Herbivory increased with
   increasing species and functional-group richness for both Conyza
   species. These patterns are interpreted as reflecting a greater number
   of available herbivore niches in a richer, more complex, plant
   community. The identities of functional groups also affected Conyza
   herbivory, which decreased in the presence of Asteraceae or Fabaceae and
   increased in the presence of Poaceae. Increasing herbivory had
   consequences for vegetative and demographic parameters of both invasive
   species: survival, final biomass and net fecundity decreased with
   increasing herbivory, leading to a loss of reproductive capacity. We
   conclude that communities characterised by a high number of grass
   species instead of Asteraceae or Fabaceae may be more resistant to
   invasion by the two Conyza species, in part due to predation by native
   herbivores.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing influences plant community structure, soil quality and

   diversity of soil mites under very heavy and light grazing regimes, and
   a very heavy grazing exclosure, and asked whether there were differences
   in abundance of mite taxa that reflected the severity of disturbance.
   The field experiment we sampled was established in 1949 on a Rough
   Fescue Prairie with Orthic Black Chernozemic (Udic Haploboroll) soils
   near Stavely Alberta Canada. Soil cores were taken from the light
   (L)(1.2 AUM (animal unit month) ha 1) and very heavy (VH) (4.8 AUM
   ha(-1)) grazing regimes and the grazing recovery exclosure (Ex) in the
   very heavy grazing site in June and October 1999. The results showed
   that the soil temperature, moisture and bulk density varied between the
   grazing regimes, soil depth and the sampling times. Collembola were not
   abundant at any of the sites compared with Acari. Among Acari,
   prostigmatid mites were significantly more abundant in VH site and all
   the grazing treatments at both depths and sampling times. Oribatida, and
   to a lesser extent Mesostigmata, were more closely associated with
   reduced and undisturbed habitats than the Prostigmata, and there was a
   positive relationship between increased grassland productivity and the
   abundance and diversity of soil microarthropods. Our results suggest

Abstract = {{After the drainage of fens and their permanent use as meadows,

   porosity 90\%, bulk density 0.15-0.35 g cm(-3), and peat-forming
   processes (Pt) were continued. As compared with natural fens, drainage
   and management of fens was associated with increasing density of total
   nematodes and their components such as bacterivores, fungivores,
   facultative plant feeders, obligate plant feeders, omnivores, and
   predators. In drained fens the density of nematodes declined with
   succession with the exception of omnivores. The increase in the density
   of omnivores was positively correlated with the number of years after
   drainage (r = 0.48, P<0.01). The indices of taxa diversity and maturity
   indices were positively correlated with years after drainage
   (P<0.001-0.05). In natural fens, ranges of density of all trophic groups
   were lower, and maturity indices higher than in drained peat meadows.
   The mechanisms driving the first stage of succession in nematode
   communities (until about 30 years after the drainage of fens) seem to be
   tolerance to the droughts and to the excess of nitrogen what was
   accompanied with higher density of herbivores (mainly Paratylenchus). In
   later stages, interspecific competition is likely to play a more
   important,role. Also a statistically significant relation was found of
   some taxa and parameters to peat type.}},

Abstract = {{Concern about the risk of harmful human-induced climate change has
   resulted in international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to
   the atmosphere. We review the international and national context for
   consideration of greenhouse abatement in native vegetation management
   and discuss potential options in Queensland. Queensland has large areas
   of productive or potentially productive land with native woody
   vegetation cover with approximately 76 million ha with woody cover
   remaining in 1991. High rates of tree clearing, predominantly to
   increase pasture productivity, continued throughout the 1990s with an
   average 345,000 ha/a estimated to have been cleared, including
   non-remnant (woody regrowth) as well as remnant vegetation. Estimates of
   greenhouse gas emissions associated with land clearing currently have a
   high uncertainty but clearing was reported to contribute a significant
   proportion of Australia's total greenhouse gas emissions from 1990
   (21\%) to 1999 (13\%). In Queensland, greenhouse emissions from land
   clearing were estimated to have been 54.5 Mt CO(2)-e in 1999. Management
   of native vegetation for timber harvesting and the proliferation of
   woody vegetation (vegetation thickening) in the grazed woodlands also
   represent large carbon fluxes. Forestry (plantations and native forests)
   in Queensland was reported to be a 4.4 Mt CO(2)-e sink in 1999 but there
   are a lack of comprehensive data on timber harvesting in private
   hardwood forests. Vegetation thickening is reported for large areas of
   the c. 60 million ha grazed woodlands in Queensland. The magnitude of
   the carbon sink in 27 million ha grazed eucalypt woodlands has been
   estimated to be 66 Mt CO(2)-e/a but this sink is not currently included
   in Australia's inventory of anthropogenic greenhouse emissions.
   Improved understanding of the function and dynamics of natural and
   managed ecosystems is required to support management of native
   vegetation to preserve and enhance carbon stocks for greenhouse benefits
   while meeting objectives of sustainable and productive management and
   biodiversity protection.}},

Abstract = {{Populations of a common burrowing rodent, Microtus californicus (the
   California vole), thrive in ungrazed or lightly grazed grasslands in
   coastal California. Two sites ungrazed by livestock, one dominated by
   native perennial grasses and another dominated by invasive annuals, were
   evaluated over 2 consecutive years for the relationship between plant
   species richness and location of M. californicus burrow entrances
   (burrows). Plant species and burrows were sampled as present or absent
   in contiguous 1-m(2) quadrats on a 100-m(2) grid. Quadrats with burrows
   averaged significantly more plant species than quadrats without them
   (11.3 vs. 9.9 species, P < 0.001). Burrows found in 1996 were not
   correlated with species richness in 1995, suggesting that voles affect
   richness rather than seek it out. Vole burrow locations showed
   significant clumping on the annual site and trended toward clumping on
   the perennial site in both 1995 and 1996. Because voles seem to create a
   clumped pattern with their burrow entrances, the associated increase in
   plant species richness may have a strong effect on the overall structure
   of the plant community A quantitative comparison of the 2 sites showed
   that the plant matrix of the perennial site contained flora of the
   annual site, This similarity in plant species composition may allow for
   similar treatment of our 2 types of sites and potentially other
   California grasslands. Undetected increases in vole populations with
   livestock grazing reduction may account for the erratic results from
   grasslands management research and the inconsistent success of derived
   management practices.}},

Abstract = {{Native temperate grassland and grassy woodlands have been subject to
   considerable modification by livestock grazing and clearance for exotic
   pastures and crops. In Victoria, very little high-quality grassy
   vegetation persists. Consequently, native grasslands and grassy
   woodlands are considered endangered ecological communities and therefore
   are a very high priority for nature conservation.
   Most of the highest-quality grassland remnants occur in small, isolated
   areas on public land. The long-term persistence and resilience of these
   scattered remnants is uncertain. Although typical remnants on private
   land are of low quality, their large size means that they have the
   potential to play an important role in the conservation of grassy
   ecosystems. One of the major challenges of the future is determining how
   to enhance the quality of these remnants on private land while ensuring
   productivity for farmers.
   This paper describes the initial results of a joint project between
   Agriculture Division and Parks, Flora and Fauna Division within
   Victoria's Department of Natural Resources and Environment. This project
   involves collaborative work between scientists, farmers, extension
   officers and policy makers to develop best management practices so that
   native grasslands on farms are grazed in a sustainable manner.
   A detailed review of grazing management strategies in native grasslands
   was undertaken. As well, market research was carried out to identify the
   attitudes of farmers and extension officers towards grazing in native
   grasslands. This work identified a lack of knowledge about appropriate
   grazing management strategies as the major impediment to conserving
   grasslands within productive grazing enterprises. Four high-priority
   research areas were identified, as follows:
   assessment of different grazing management regimes (e.g., timing, set
   stocking versus cell grazing) for biodiversity enhancement or loss;
   determination of maximum productivity gains in grasslands (e.g.,
   fertiliser rates, livestock density) beyond which there is biodiversity
   loss;
   cost-effective broadscale re-establishment and enhancement of native
   grassland; and
   identification of productivity benefits of conserving biodiversity in
   natural grassland ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the responses of the ground vegetation in a 17-year-old
   coastal dune forest plant community to four levels of experimentally
   applied livestock grazing (three grazing levels and one ungrazed
   control) from May 1994 to March 1996. The effects of grazing were
   apparently subordinate to site-specific intrinsic vegetation change and
   there were some indications that rainfall interacted with grazing level.
   Grazing had some apparent but no significant effects on plant species
   composition, significantly affected plant species richness over time,
   and significantly increased the range of species richness and vegetation
   cover values as well as the relative abundance and numbers of plant
   species with erect growth forms. Vegetation cover changed significantly
   over time, independently of grazing. Our results point to two important,
   easily measured mechanisms for the conservation management of coastal
   dune forests - the interaction of disturbance type with plant growth
   form and the increase of variation in community structural variables
   under disturbance. These mechanisms, although they potentially have wide
   application and predictive power, have not been studied adequately.}},

Abstract = {{We compared the plant species composition, productivity and canopy
   structure of seven mown sites to a chronosequence of 20 abandoned
   calcareous fens in northeastern Switzerland. Cessation of mowing led to
   an 18\% decline in overall plant species richness and the diversity of
   most functional groups. Abandonment did not lead to marked increases of
   above-ground productivity, but rather selectively favoured certain
   functional groups. On abandoned fens biomass of grasses increased nearly
   threefold, at the expense of biomass of Cyperaceac and Jancaccae, which
   declined by 30\%, compared to mown fens, while forb biomass remained
   unaffected. Litter mass increased more than 15-fold in fallows, while
   canopy height increased by 50\%. The foliage in abandoned fens was
   oriented more horizontally and had a lower overall cover. However, these
   successional changes were never dependent upon the age of the fallow.
   Furthermore, nearly all traits differed significantly on regional and

Abstract = {{The tussock grass Deschampsia cespitosa, considered to be conspecific
   with the very polymorphic taxon which is cosmopolitan in temperate and
   cold regions, is currently classed amongst the 62 ``vulnerable{''}
   indigenous vascular species for New Zealand. Previously more widespread
   here, the species' demise in certain regions within the last century has
   been attributed to grazing and/or competition from aggressive introduced
   grasses. This study provides the first quantification of the flora,
   vegetation, and soil of an indigenous grassland stand dominated by D.
   cespitosa. Cover-abundance data were recorded from 15 randomly placed
   quadrats in a localised intact stand of D. cespitoso subalpine
   tussockland, occupying an ancient landslide depression in eastern
   Fiordland. These data are related to comparable information gathered
   from adjacent, more extensive, Chionochloa rubra ssp. cuprea (copper)
   tussockland. Multivariate analysis confirmed the distinction of the two
   stands in terms of species abundance but indicated continuous floristic
   variation among the 51 plant taxa recorded. The floristic similarity for
   the two stands was 49\%, which was not statistically significant,
   whereas that for the cover-abundance data was only 5\%. Soils under the
   site-specific D. cespitosa stand were classified as silt loams while
   those of the C. rubra ssp. cuprea (copper) tussockland are sandy clay
   loams with water content, organic matter, and root mass all much higher
   in the former. The Fiordland population showed no signs of grazing use
   despite the presence of introduced herbivores. Only one non-aggressive
   grass, amongst the three exotic species, was recorded. On the basis of
   this study, D. cespitosa tussockland is proposed as a new indigenous
   vegetation type for New Zealand.}},

Abstract = {{In loess grasslands, grazing by sheep is responsible for changes in the
   composition of vegetation and controls on secondary successional
   processes. Grazing has a very complex effect on the soil by altering its
   physical, chemical and biological properties, which makes it difficult
   to distinguish the underlying mechanisms. Landscape heterogeneity also
   influences soil and vegetation processes, having a greater effect on
   environmental factors than sheep grazing. To compare the relative
   effects of sheep grazing and one aspect of landscape heterogeneity on
   the collembolan community, four valleys with two grazing treatments were
   selected. The sides of each valley had SW and NE aspects resulting in
   two types of landscape heterogeneity. In a split-plot experimental
   design, the effects of grazing pressure and aspect were examined in
   relation to the relative abundance, species richness, evenness and
   composition of the collembolan community. Grazing pressure had a
   positive effect on total abundance and a negative effect on species
   richness of Collembola. Aspect did not significantly influence total
   abundance but valley sides exposed to SW had a higher species richness.
   Grazing changed the dominance structure, reduced the evenness and
   strongly influenced the composition of the collembolan community. Due to
   grazing xerotherm epedaphic species disappeared resulting a less diverse
   Collembola fauna. Aspect had a lesser effect on collembolan community
   composition than grazing. The results suggest that the diversity of
   springtails maintained by landscape heterogeneity in loess valley sides
   is reduced by sheep grazing. Further, differences in soil humidity could
   not explain the changes in structure and abundance of the collembolan
   community alone, sheep grazing may drive changes in collembolan
   community through mechanisms of biotic effects. (C) 2001 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Large herbivores are known to respond to spatial heterogeneity in the
   distribution of forage resources, but how important herbivores are in
   creating those spatial patterns, how their influence may be scale
   dependent, and how herbivore-induced patterns affect ecosystem processes
   remain unclear. We examined the effects of native migratory ungulates on
   the spatial distribution of soil nitrogen and N-mineralization potential
   at scales ranging from 0.1-30 m in grasslands of Yellowstone National
   Park using geostatistical analyses of soils collected inside and outside
   long-term (36+-yr) exclosures.
   At small spatial scales (0.1-2 m), ungrazed grasslands showed a high
   degree of patchiness in the distribution of soil N and N-mineralization
   potential (94\% and 77\% of sample variation explained by small-scale
   patchiness, respectively). For both variables, patches occurred at a
   consistent mean size of similar to 40 cm. In contrast, grazed grassland
   exhibited minimal spatial structure in the distribution of soil N and
   N-mineralization rates (< 24\% of variation for both variables spatially
   dependent) and no consistent patch size at a scale of 0.1-2 m. In grazed
   grassland, most variation was extremely fine grained, occurring across
   distances < 10 cm. The high degree of fine-grained heterogeneity in
   grazed grassland was associated with greater plant diversity in small
   (20 x 20 cm) patches. Recycling of nitrogen through dung and urine is
   clearly important for maintaining long-term nitrogen balance of the
   system, but we estimated that only 2.5\% of the grazed grassland sampled
   was recently affected by urine. Results conflict with predictions of
   increased heterogeneity in grazed communities based primarily on the
   deposition of dung and urine in discrete patches and suggest that the
   dominant mechanism(s) by which grazers alter N cycling in this ecosystem
   operates through the plant community. We hypothesize that grazers
   promote fine-scale heterogeneity by diversifying plant species effects
   on soils and/or increasing the spatial variability in plant litter
   inputs.
   At larger spatial scales (5-30 m), large herbivores altered the
   distribution of soil N across a topographic gradient. In a grazed

Title = {{Soil biota in an ungrazed grassland: Response to annual grass (Bromus
   tectorum) invasion}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1261-1275}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Bromus tectorum is an exotic annual grass that currently dominates many
   western U.S. semi-arid ecosystems, and the effects of this grass on
   ecosystems in general, and soil biota specifically, are unknown. Bromus
   recently invaded two ungrazed and unburned perennial bunchgrass
   communities in southeastern Utah. This study compared the soil food-web
   structure of the two native grassland associations (Stipa {[}S] and
   Hilaria {[}H]), with and without the presence of Bromus. Perennial grass
   and total vascular-plant cover were higher in S than in H plots, while
   quantities of ground litter were similar. Distribution of live and dead
   plant material was highly clumped in S and fairly homogenous in H. Soil
   food-web structure was different between H and S, with lower trophic
   levels more abundant in H and higher trophic levels more abundant in S.
   In Bromus-invaded plots. the quantity of ground litter was 2.2 times
   higher in Hilaria-Bromus (HB) than in H plots, and 2.8 times higher in
   Stipa-Bromus (SB) than in S plots. Soil biota in HB generally responded
   to the Bromus invasion in an opposite manner than in SB, e.g., if a
   given component of the food web increased in one community, it generally
   decreased in the other. Active bacteria decreased in H vs. HB, while
   increasing in S vs. SB. Soil and live plant-infecting fungi were the
   exception, as they increased in both types of invaded plots relative to
   uninvaded plots. Dead-plant-infecting fungi decreased in H vs. HB and
   increased in S vs. SB. Most higher-trophic-level organisms increased in
   HB relative to H, while decreasing in SB relative to S. Given the mixed
   response to invasion, the structure of these soil food webs appears to
   be controlled by both plant inputs and internal dynamics between trophic
   levels. When compared to non-invaded sites, soil and soil food-web
   characterisitics of the newly invaded sites included: (1) lower species
   richness and lower absolute numbers of fungi and invertebrates; (2)
   greater abundance of active bacteria; (3) similar species of bacteria
   and fungi as those found in soils invaded over 50 yr ago; (4) higher
   levels of silt (thus greater fertility and soil water-holding capacity);
   and (5) a more continuous cover of living and dead plant material (thus
   facilitating germination of the large-seeded Bromus). These results
   illustrate that (1) soil food-web structure can vary widely within what
   would generally be considered one vegetation type (semi-arid grassland),
   depending on plant species composition within that type, and (2)
   addition of a common resource can evoke disparate responses from
   individual food-web compartments, depending on their original structure.}},

Abstract = {{When management, in the form of cattle grazing and mowing, ceases the
   abundance of competitively superior plant species tends to increase in
   abandoned semi-natural meadows, Litter accumulation elevates the soil
   nutrient levels and hinders seedling recruitment. We surveyed changes in
   plant cover and species composition of a formerly grazed meadow in
   permanent plots for six years. Some plots were unmown, while others were
   mown and raked annually in August. The cover of grasses decreased and
   herb cover remained unchanged regardless of the treatment. Mowing and
   raking significantly reduced litter accumulation and increased the
   number of ground layer species. The expected long-term effects of
   abandonment and restorative mowing were studied by calculating the
   transition probabilities for unmown and mown plots and simulating the
   course of succession as projected by the transition matrices. During a
   simulation period of 30 yr, abandonment led to (1) a decrease in the
   cover of small herbs, (2) a slight increase in the cover of tall herbs
   and (3) a slight decrease in the cover of grasses. In contrast. the
   cover of small herbs on the mown plots remained unchanged or slightly
   increased during the course of simulation. These results suggest that
   mowing late in the season is primarily a management tool for the
   maintenance of the existing species diversity and composition. However,
   it may not be an effective restorative tool to induce overall changes in
   the resident vegetation of abandoned grass-dominated meadows. Grazing or
   mowing early in the season may be more effective in this respect.
   Consequently, mowing early or, alternatively, late in the season may
   provide management strategies for the maintenance and restoration of
   species diversity, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of flooding
   and draw-down on the germination from the coastal grassland seed banks
   and to determine whether the effect of flooding varies between the delta
   and the seashore. Seed bank samples were collected from three shore
   transects in SW Finland, two on the shore of the Baltic Sea and one on
   the delta of River Kokemaenjoki. Samples were germinated in non-flooded
   and flooded conditions for over a month. after which both treatments
   were maintained in non-flooded conditions, A total of 9267 seedlings of
   47 species germinated and mean density of seeds in the soil was cu. 84
   000/m(2). Most of the seedlings were monocots (98\%) and perennials
   (98\%). Ca. 30-40\% of the species found in the above-ground vegetation
   had a seed bank including the majority of the most abundant species. The
   number of seeds and species richness increased as the organic layer
   became thicker. The organic layer was thicker in the seashore samples
   and the seed bank was significantly larger than in the delta. The
   flooding and draw-down treatment significantly increased the number of
   germinating seedlings in the seashore and also increased species
   richness in two transects, one in the delta and the other in the
   seashore. Two species. Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani and Typha
   latifolia, had significantly higher germination in the flooded treatment
   than in the non-flooded. Apparently, many species in these coastal
   grasslands have adapted to flood disturbance and for seeds of some
   species flooding may work as a positive signal, possibly breaking
   dormancy.}},

Volume = {{52}},

Abstract = {{Two areas of the Venice lagoon populated by seagrasses (three stations
   covered by Cymodocea nodosa (Ucria) Asherson, Zostera marina Linnaeus,
   Zostera noltii Hornemann) or seaweeds (two stations: one covered by Ulva
   rigida C. Agardh and another at present without seaweed biomass) were
   monitored by means of six surveys over a year in order to study
   macrofaunal composition and seasonal changes. The seagrass stations
   showed a mean species richness (28-30 S m(-2)), individual abundance
   (1854-4018 N m(-2)) and biomass (22.3-37.7 g m(-2) ash-free-dry-weight,
   AFDW) ca. 3-8 times higher than those populated by seaweeds (10-15 S
   m(-1), 494-1395 N m(-2) and 5.6-13.7 g m(-2) AFDW). Differences among
   seagrass or seaweed stations were much lower. The Ulva-dominated station
   showed a macrofauna completely different both from the other stations
   and the communities recorded ca. 30 years ago, before the prolific
   growth of Ulva. In this station, frequent biomass decompositions and
   anoxic crises created critical conditions for life favouring organisms
   with reduced life cycles, younger individuals and the epifaunal species
   instead of the infaunal ones. In particular, Ulva grazers and scrapers
   such as Gammarus aequicauda Stock and Gibbula adriatica Philippi were
   found to be by far the most abundant species, whereas the taxa
   characteristic of the associations found in the past, in the presence of
   seagrasses or seaweeds and typical of low eutrophicated environments,
   appear strongly reduced. Marked differences in the macrophyte dominance
   and in the bio-physico-chemical variables which characterise the main
   environmental conditions of the Venice lagoon support the different
   distribution and composition of macrofaunal communities. Seaweed
   stations appear mainly governed by the seasonal cycles of these
   un-rooted macrophytes which, by alternating periods of production and
   decomposition, are responsible for the drastic reduction of macrofauna
   biodiversity and biomass. Conversely, seagrass stations exhibit a better
   oxidisation of the environment and show conditions more favourable for
   macrofauna colonisation, especially in the presence, of macrophytes
   which are characterised by very well developed below-ground systems such
   as Cymodocea nodosa. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{112-124}},

Abstract = {{Species-specific responses to atmospheric CO2 enrichment may affect
   biodiversity,,which in turn may alter ecosystem functioning. Here we
   have explored biodiversity effects in model assemblages of semi-arid
   grassland of the northern Negev, Israel, at 280 ppm (pre-industrial
   era), 440 ppm (early 21st century) and 600 ppm CO2 (mid to late 21st
   century). Thirty-two mostly annual species were grown together in large
   containers (ca 400 kg each) on native soil and under a dynamic
   simulation of the Negev winter climate, CO2 enrichment increased
   concentrations of total non-structural carbohydrates and C/N ratios, and
   reduced specific leaf area and nitrogen concentrations in leaves of all
   species. In contrast to these uniform CO2 effects on leaf quality.
   biomass and reproductive output remained unchanged in most species, and
   varied greatly among the few responsive ones ( - 80 to + 145\%). Biomass
   was significantly increased at elevated CO2 in Onobrychis crista-galli
   (one of the six legume species) and was reduced in Biscutella didyma
   (Brassicaceae). Seed yield increased in three out of six legumes and in
   the root hemiparasite Parentucellia flaviflora. and decreased in the
   grass Aegilops peregrina. Fruit dry matter tended to be reduced in two
   Brassicaceae. Onobrychis, the largest and most responsive species
   present, was the most `mesic' legume, and might have profited most from
   the higher soil moisture induced by CO2 enrichment. The significant CO2
   response of only 5-6 out of 32 species, in particular their altered seed
   yield, suggests a potential shift in biodiversity. In a future
   CO2-enriched atmosphere. `mesic' legumes and root hemiparasites might be
   favored. while some Brassicaceae and grasses might decline. As indicated
   by significant 280- vs 440-ppm differences. reductions in leaf nitrogen
   concentration of grasses and legumes are likely to be under way right
   now, and may negatively affect grazers. Altered seed yields were more
   pronounced between 440 and 600 ppm, suggesting that these changes could
   intensify as the atmospheric CO2 concentration continues to rise.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term variations in the frequency and intensity of sheep (Ovis
   aries) grazing have led to the development of ubiquitous plant
   successional transitions in sub-montane regions of the UK. In this
   study, we measured a range of soil microbial properties across these
   successional transitions in three biogeographic regions of the UK, to
   establish how gradients If grazing-influence (in terms of the history
   and intensity of sheep grazing) alter the biomass, activity, and
   structure of soil microbial communities. We also measured soil
   physicochemical variables to relate changes in soil microbial community
   arrangement along these grazing-related successional transitions to key
   soil properties. Our results from three locations show that microbial
   communities of soils display some consistent and `broad-scale' trends
   along successional transitions that are related to the history and
   intensity of grazing. We show that microbial biomass of soil is maximal
   at low-to-intermediate levels of grazing influence and that the
   phenotypic evenness (a component of diversity) of the microbial
   community declines as the intensity of grazing increases. We also
   provide evidence that soil microbial communities of heavily grazed sites
   a-re dominated by bacterial-based energy channels of decomposition,
   whereas in systems that are less intensively grazed, or completely
   unmanaged, fungi have a proportionally greater role. Further studies are
   needed to establish the significance of these changes in relation to
   soil-level ecosystem processes of decomposition and nutrient cycling.
   The data show that human disturbances can have profound effects on the
   biomass and structure of the soil communities that regulate soil
   processes in these ecosystems and that these effects are consistent
   across sites. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Pastures typically have diverse landscapes, and resulting soil

   study was performed to quantify the spatial variation in legume
   contribution to the plant community when seeded into established
   perennial cool-season grass pastures. Pastures were interseeded with an
   11-legume mixture and divided into three stocking methods (continuous,
   rotational, and nongrazed), with each stocking method containing five
   landscape positions (summit, backslope, toeslope, opposite backslope,
   and opposite summit). Grass and legume components were sampled three
   times annually between 1996 and 1998. Backslopes had greater legume dry
   matter (DM) composition (161 g kg(-1)) than either summit (62 g kg(-1))
   or toeslope positions (7 g kg(-1)), and total legume concentrations
   increased over years. Legume composition consisted mostly of red clover
   (Trifolium pratense L.), birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), and
   white clover (T. repens L.). Species richness and Shannon-Weiner
   diversity index (H'(dm)) for the legume functional group were also
   greatest on backslope landscape positions, especially in continuously
   and rotationally stocked pastures. Legume DM composition showed a
   positive linear relationship with legume species richness in continuous,
   rotational, and nongrazed pastures (r(2) = 0.76). The H'(dm) showed a
   positive linear relationship with legume DM composition in only
   rotationally stocked paddocks (r(2) = 0.88). The legume component at
   grazed backslope sites filled a niche left unoccupied by the grass
   component. Species and site recommendations for pasture improvement and
   management should be made based on landscape position and stocking

Abstract = {{Concern over the accelerating loss of biodiversity has stimulated
   renewed interest in relationships among species richness, species
   composition, and the functional properties of ecosystems.
   Mechanistically, the degree of functional differentiation or
   complementarity among individual species determines the form of such
   relationships and is thus important to distinguishing among alternative
   hypotheses for the effects of diversity on ecosystem processes. Although
   a growing number of studies have reported relationships between plant
   diversity and ecosystem processes, few have explicitly addressed how
   functional diversity at higher trophic levels influences ecosystem
   processes. We used mesocosm experiments to test the impacts of three
   herbivorous crustacean species (Gammarus mucronatus, Idotea baltica, and
   Erichsonella attenuata) on plant biomass accumulation, relative
   dominance of plant functional groups, and herbivore secondary production
   in beds of eelgrass (Zostera marina), a dominant feature of naturally
   low-diversity estuaries throughout the northern hemisphere. By
   establishing treatments with all possible combinations of the three
   grazer species, we tested the degree of functional redundancy among
   grazers and their relative impacts on productivity.
   Grazer species composition strongly influenced eelgrass biomass
   accumulation and grazer secondary production, whereas none of the
   processes we studied was clearly related to grazer species richness over
   the narrow range (0-3 species) studied. In fact, all three measured
   ecosystem processes-epiphyte grazing, and eelgrass and grazer biomass
   accumulation-reached highest values in particular single-species
   treatments. Experimental deletions of individual species from the
   otherwise-intact assemblage confirmed that the three grazer species were
   functionally redundant in impacting epiphyte accumulation, whereas
   secondary production was sensitive to deletion of G. mucronatus,
   indicating its unique, nonredundant role in influencing this variable.
   In the field, seasonal abundance patterns differed markedly among the
   dominant grazer species, suggesting that complementary grazer
   phenologies may reduce total variance in grazing pressure on an annual
   basis. Our results show that even superficially similar grazer species
   can differ in both sign and magnitude of impacts on ecosystem processes
   and emphasize that one must be cautious in assuming redundancy when
   assigning species to functional groups.}},

   10-m-wide ungrazed buffer strips located along the stream. We calculated
   total number of birds, the Berger-Parker Index of Dominance, and number
   of birds ha(-1) for each site. Vegetation variables used were

   rotationally grazed pastures did not support more of these species than
   continuously grazed pastures. Bird density was related to vegetation
   structure, with higher densities found on sites with deeper litter.

Abstract = {{We used a relatively simple and direct remote-sensing approach to
   determine biodiversity values in arid ecosystems and thus identify
   potential conservation sites. We developed indices based on regression
   models between, grass, shrub, litter, exposed-soil groundcover
   components and Landsat thematic mapper satellite imagery reflectance
   values over a reference site in the northern Chihuahuan Desert in New
   Mexico. This site supports low-disturbance grasslands that have been
   under a continuous grazing regime for over 100 years. Greater richness
   and abundance of noninvasive and nonruderal plant species were
   associated with the low-disturbance grasslands that had lower shrub
   abundance, increased litter and grass cover, and lower exposed soil.
   Using the thematic mapper indices, we computed an additive grassland
   biodiversity index such that, as exposed soil and shrub values go down,
   litter and grass values go up, as does the biodiversity index. When the
   biodiversity index was applied to the reference-site landscape,
   grasslands previously identified for their high conservation value were
   detected. As a further test, we applied the indices to a site in
   Chihuahua, Mexico, that supports similar grasslands but for which there
   are few other data on condition and conservation values. The soil,
   grass, and shrub indices were moderately effective in describing the
   range of variation at the Mexico site, but the litter equation was not.
   Still, higher biodiversity value in terms of nonruderal plant diversity
   tended to correspond to higher grass cover and lower soil exposure and a
   higher overall biodiversity index. Some localized calibration with
   geologic substrate may be required along with an assessment of the
   temporal constraints, but generally the index shows promise for quickly
   and efficiently detecting desert grasslands of high biodiversity
   conservation value.}},

Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Species-rich grasslands that become enriched with nitrogen often suffer
   decreases in species richness, increases in plant biomass, and invasion
   by weedy exotic species. Suitable techniques to restore enriched
   grasslands and reestablish native communities are increasingly needed.
   Here we report results of a 5-yr experiment in enriched coastal prairie
   grasslands (Bodega Marine Reserve, Bodega Bay, California, USA), to
   determine the combined effects of mowing and biomass removal on total
   soil nitrogen, net rates of mineralization, nitrogen retention, and
   species richness and biomass. We mowed and removed plant biomass from
   plots in areas where the N-fixing shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus arboreus),
   had greatly enriched the soil, and where the community was composed of
   weedy introduced plants. Our goal was to facilitate the establishment of
   the native grassland assemblage such as was found at nearby low soil
   nitrogen sites.
   Mowing and biomass removal resulted in a dramatic change in the species
   assemblage, from exotic annual grasses to a mixed exotic/native forb
   community composed primarily of perennials. Species richness was
   significantly greater in treated plots than in control plots weedy
   exotic grasses diminished in abundance, and both native and exotic forb
   species increased. In mowed vs. control plots, there was significantly
   less mean aboveground biomass, but significantly greater belowground
   biomass. This shift in species composition had significant impacts on
   nitrogen retention. In late fall and winter when plant-available N was
   highest, much nitrogen leached from the effectively fallow control plots
   where germination of annual grasses did not peak until midwinter. In
   contrast, mowed plots retained substantially greater amounts of
   nitrogen, due to the presence of perennial plants possessing large
   amounts of belowground biomass early in the season. Despite the
   cumulative removal of 22 g N/M-2 in biomass over 5 yr, there was no
   difference between mowed and control plots in total soil N, pool sizes
   of inorganic N, or net rates of N mineralization. The results indicate
   that removal of plant biomass by mowing shifted this plant community
   from an annual grass to a perennial forb assemblage. However, in doing
   so, N retention by vegetation was increased, making it more difficult to
   reduce soil N.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The conservation of biodiversity in landscape mosaics requires an
   understanding of the impacts of human land use within mosaic elements
   and an evaluation of the biological uniqueness of different elements. We
   address these issues by examining patterns of ant diversity in three
   semiarid rangeland landscapes used predominantly for grazing. These
   landscapes lie along a regional gradient from shortgrass steppe through
   a transitional zone to desert grassland, along which climate and ant
   species composition vary. Within each landscape, we compared the effects
   of grazing and natural variation in soils and vegetation on ant
   diversity and community composition. Grazing had little effect on ant
   richness, diversity, or composition at the transitional zone or the
   desert grassland site, but ungrazed areas at the shortgrass steppe site
   had a higher overall richness and favored the abundance of some species.
   Some samples of saltbush (Atriplex canescens) shrubland were similar to
   ungrazed samples in richness and species composition. In both the
   transitional zone and the desert grassland, creosotebush (Larrea
   tridentata)-dominated habitats harbored comparatively species-rich and
   distinct ant communities. In addition, mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa)
   coppice dunes at the desert grassland site favored the abundance of
   several species that were rare across the site. Canonical correspondence
   analysis revealed that variation in soil strength and texture best
   explained community variation at the shortgrass steppe site, whereas
   soil texture and associated differences in shrub density best explained
   differences in composition at the transitional and desert grassland
   sites. The characterization of habitats based upon vegetation
   classification did not adequately reflect environmental variation that
   was important to ants in shortgrass steppe, but reflected important soil
   textural variation in the transitional and desert grassland sites. These
   results suggest that ant conservation in these semiarid rangelands
   should emphasize patterns of variation in soil properties. The results
   add to a growing consensus that a variety of variables determined by the
   responses of several focal taxa may be needed to characterize
   biodiversity patterns.}},

Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1141-1150}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Livestock grazing is the dominant land use in the remaining seminatural
   grasslands in Europe. Abandonment of grasslands and, conversely,
   intensified grazing by livestock have been suggested as possible causes
   for the widespread population declines of many farmland birds, although
   the direct impact of grazing on farmland birds is poorly known. Here, we
   use a comprehensive, long-term data set (20 pastures surveyed over five
   years) to test the effects of changes in grazing intensities in
   seminatural dry pastures on between-year variation of the farmland bird
   community, functional groups of species, and individual species. Bird
   communities in all 20 seminatural pastures showed a low degree of
   temporal variability (Kendall's coefficient of concordance on ranked
   abundances: mean W = 0.72, range = 0.58-0.89). Community variability was
   not significantly related to site area, grazing pressure, vegetation
   structure, or adjacent habitat composition. However, analyses of
   functional groups of species categorized according to body mass and
   breeding diet showed that different species subsets had differential
   responses to between-year changes in grazing pressure (as reflected by
   changes in grass height). Local extinction and recolonization of
   ground-feeding insectivorous bird species were affected by yearly
   changes in grazing pressure, but there was no effect of grazing on
   ground-feeding species that fed on a mixed diet or on species that
   foraged in trees and shrubs. In general, large insectivores (> 30 g)
   preferred moderately grazed pastures, and small insectivores (less than
   or equal to 30 g) preferred pastures with intensive grazing pressure. We
   propose that Current intensive grazing should be relaxed (i.e., by

Abstract = {{1. This study investigates the effects of experimental plant communities
   on different trophic levels in the soil food web of abandoned arable
   land.
   2. In April 1996, a biodiversity experiment commenced using a
   continuation of agricultural crop rotation (CCR), spontaneous succession
   with naturally colonizing plant species (NC) and late-successional plant
   species sown in low-diversity (LD, four plant species) and
   high-diversity (HD, 15 plant species) communities. The nematode
   community was used as an indicator of the influence of the experimental
   plant communities on different trophic levels in the soil food web.
   3. The nematode abundance in the experimental plant communities differed
   from that of the continued crop rotation, but there were hardly any
   differences between the natural, the low-diversity and the
   high-diversity plant communities.
   4. The abundant plant-feeding nematodes and the somewhat less abundant
   bacterivorous nematodes were stimulated most by the sowing treatments.
   Fungivorous nematodes were stimulated less, while the numbers of
   omnivorous and carnivorous nematodes did not change significantly.
   5. The diversity of the nematode community did not change over 2 years.
   6. It is concluded that experimental plant communities have either small
   short-term effects or a delayed impact on the soil food web compared
   with the effect they have on above-ground invertebrate community
   development.}},

Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{836-845}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. The relationship between biomass and species richness in temperate
   vegetation has been described as a hump-back response model. The
   hump-back model predicts that herbaceous species richness is highest at
   an intermediate level of biomass. However, this has not been
   investigated in arid-zone grazing lands.
   2. We tested the hump-back prediction in an and tropical grazing region
   in northern Kenya where a seasonal grazing exclosure system is
   practised. We compared vegetation structure, species richness and
   composition on an open range and exclosures at five sites to elucidate
   the potential mechanisms behind variation in species richness.
   3. More biomass was accumulated within seasonal exclosures than in
   continuously grazed areas. Species richness in exclosure plots varied
   from 5.3 to 8.3 species In 2, while that in open plots varied from 5.1
   to 7.5 species m(-2). A pair-wise test showed no difference in two of
   the five sites with respect to both total and herbaceous species
   richness.
   4. The primary floristic gradient illuminated through ordination was
   related to biomass, while the secondary gradient was related to species
   richness. The exclosure plots had more abundant species, especially
   compared with open plots, which had more rare and occasional species. A
   total of 37 herbaceous species was recorded; 22\% were indifferent to
   grazing, 30\% grazing intolerant and 48\% promoted by grazing.
   5. The relationship between biomass and herbaceous species richness
   showed (i) no trend within the exclosures (maximum biomass 800 g m(-2));
   (ii) a positive trend in the open grazing land (maximum of 500 g m(-2));
   and a hump-back pattern when (i) and (ii)were analysed together. Optimum
   richness corresponded to a biomass level of 400-500 g m(-2). Species
   richness declined with increase in age of exclosures.
   6. We confirmed that species richness will decline when biomass exceeds
   500 g m(-2), as predicted by the hump-back model, even in and grazing
   lands. Seasonal grazing exclosures may increase species richness to a
   certain level, but the decline in species richness with age of
   exclosures indicates that long-term exclusion of grazing may not
   necessarily increase species richness in arid-zone grazing lands.}},

Abstract = {{1 The spatial pattern of vegetation heterogeneity across different
   scales may indicate the major environmental controls on vegetation
   structure. and thus guide strategies for the conservation of
   biodiversity.
   2 We analysed cross-scale vegetation patterns in a 90000-km(2) area of
   natural grasslands in the Flooding Pampa, Argentina. We assessed the
   contribution of regional (latitudinal) and landscape (topographic)
   patterns of species turnover to overall heterogeneity using data from
   749 censuses.
   3 A large proportion of the variation in species composition across the
   entire region was observed at very fine spatial scales (0.1-10 km(2)),
   associated with subtle topographic features and soil salinity gradients.
   Latitudinal variation played a secondary role.
   4 Species turnover among stands occupying different landscape positions
   at the same latitude was 50\% greater than among inventories
   encompassing two degrees of latitude. The fine-grain heterogeneity
   determined that an area of 10 km(2) was often sufficient to include 50\%
   of all vascular plant species of the region.
   5 Although a large proportion (nearly 70\%) of the vascular flora was
   composed of rare (satellite) species that occurred in less than 10\% of
   the samples, few core species (i.e. those occurring in more than 90\% of
   the samples) were seen at any scale of analysis.
   6 Latitude contributed most clearly to variation in species composition
   among the zonal communities located in well-drained soils where
   differences in relative cover of C-3 and C-4 grasses were seen. However,
   photosynthetic pathways still varied more along salinity or topographic
   gradients than across regions. A latitudinal pattern in abundance of the
   different Poaceae tribes was also consistent with their climatic
   classification.
   7 Alpha diversity showed a threefold variation among different stands
   within a landscape: it increased from low topographic positions and high
   soil salinity to high topographic positions and low salinity. However,
   it was constant among surveys within the region.
   8 Nearly 25\% of the species were exotic, mostly European, whose
   invasion was promoted by livestock grazing. Compared with the native
   species, exotics were consistently enriched in annuals., particularly
   forbs, across latitude, and were less tightly associated with landscape
   heterogeneity than native species.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing can alter the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation, influencing
   ecosystem processes and biodiversity. Our objective was to identify why
   grazing causes increases in the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation in
   some cases, but decreases in others. The immediate effect of grazing on
   heterogeneity depends on the interaction between the spatial pattern of
   grazing and the preexisting spatial pattern of vegetation. Depending on
   the scale of observation and on the factors that determine animal
   distribution, grazing patterns may be stronger or weaker than vegetation
   patterns, or may mirror the spatial structure of vegetation. For each
   possible interaction between these patterns, we make a prediction about
   resulting changes in the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation. Case
   studies from the literature support our predictions. although ecosystems
   characterized by strong plant-soil interactions present important
   exceptions. While the processes by which grazing causes increases in
   heterogeneity are clear, how grazing leads to decreases in heterogeneity
   is less so. To explore how grazing can consistently dampen the
   fine-scale spatial patterns of competing plant species, we built a
   cell-based simulation model that features two competing plant species,
   different grazing patterns. and different sources of vegetation pattern.
   Only the simulations that included neighborhood interactions as a source
   of vegetation pattern produced results consistent with the predictions
   we derived from the literature review.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of light competition and litter on seedling recruitment and
   the performance of established individuals were examined in Viola
   palustris. This polycarpic perennial plant was a common component of
   species-rich fen meadows in northwestern Germany until the middle of
   this century, but today is considered to be regionally endangered. From
   summer 1996 until summer 1998 a bi-factorial field experiment combining
   three standing crop treatments (mowing, thinning, control) with two
   litter layer treatments (litter removal, no litter removal) was carried
   out in an abandoned fen meadow to investigate the effects of these
   factors both on V. palustris and on aboveground species composition and
   diversity. MANOVAs (multivariate analysis of variance) revealed
   significant treatment effects for the performance of V. palustris
   related to experimental manipulation. Mowing increased vital attributes
   including the number of rosette leaves, the percentage of individuals
   with chasmogamous and cleistogamous flowers and the number of rhizomes.
   In contrast, the length of the leafstalk, mean leaf area and the length
   of rhizomes were negatively associated with mowing. Litter removal
   significantly increased the number of V. palustris seedlings. The
   removal of the litter layer already resulted in an increase in
   aboveground species richness in the first year of the experiment. After
   three years of experimental manipulation, both aboveground species
   richness and diversity were positively associated with mowing.
   Redundancy Analysis showed that typical wet meadow species (Cardamine
   pratensis, Lychnis flos-cuculi, Lotus pedunculatus) and species of
   mesotrophic fens (Viola palustris, Agrostis canina, Potentilla
   palustris) were positively influenced by mowing. It can be concluded
   that V. palustris recruitment and growth is promoted by a regular
   disturbance regime on fen meadows. The conservation of many typical
   species of wet meadows and fens in northwestern Germany depends on
   moderate grazing or cutting. These management types prevent successional
   changes which lead to an increase in standing crop and the development
   of a litter layer, both of which can cause local extinction.}},

Abstract = {{This literature review concerns insect responses to fire, compared to
   other feasible and appropriate conservation managements of open
   habitats. Many insect groups decline markedly immediately after fire,
   with the magnitude of reduction related to the degree of exposure to the
   flames and mobility of the insect. Niche diversity is lower in recently
   burned habitat, and the rate of insect increase following fire also
   relates to the species' ability to gain access to the regrowing
   vegetation. Postburn flora can be quite attractive to some recolonizing
   insects, possibly to some degree a result of fire-caused insect
   mortality which provides plants with short-term release from insect
   herbivory. Insect declines may follow immediately after mowing, but
   usually of lesser degree and shorter duration than after a fire of
   comparable timing and size. Season and scale of cutting may affect how
   much and which species showed positive or negative responses. Cut areas
   offer the vegetational structure and composition preferred by some
   insects, but cutting - or cutting at certain scales, seasons, or
   frequencies - may also be unfavorable for some species. Heavy grazing
   results in niche and assemblage simplification. Nonetheless, some
   invertebrates prefer the short turfs and bare ground resulting from
   heavier grazing. Other species vary in whether they peak in abundance
   and diversity in intermediate, light, or no grazing. In comparisons of
   mowing/haying and grazing regimes of similar compatibility with
   maintenance of the same habitat types, responses of particular species
   and species groups varied as to whether they had a preference for one or
   the other. Characteristics associated with insect responses to fire
   related to the degree of exposure to lethal temperature and stress
   experienced in the post-fire environment, suitability of post-treatment
   vegetation as habitat, and ability to rebuild numbers in the site (from
   survivors and/or colonizers). These factors appear equally useful for
   explicating insect responses to other managements such as haying,
   mowing, and grazing. By contrast, the assumption that the most
   habitat-restricted species will be most adapted to ecological forces
   believed to be prevalent in that ecosystem appears less efficacious for
   predicting insect management preferences.}},

Abstract = {{We report a 36-month echo of vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus)
   seed-selection in the composition of synthetic forb communities in
   Wisconsin. An initial study showed direct suppression of an
   exceptionally large-seeded (seed > 15 mg) species (Silphium
   integrifolium, Asteraceae) by seed-size predation by rodents during the
   winter, resulting in indirect release of small-seeded (seed less than or
   equal to 1.5 mg) species. Twelve months after planting, plant
   diversities (Simpson's D) were 33\% higher in plots exposed to winter
   seed selection by rodents. Thirty-six months after planting, Silphium
   integrifolium had almost equalized densities in rodent access (20.8 +/-
   4.1 m(-2)) and exclusion (29.0 +/- 5.2 m(-2)) plots, but still
   suppressed both large-seeded (greater than or equal to 3.5 mg) and
   small-seeded (less than or equal to 1.5 mg) species (F-1,F-16=11.84 and
   F-1,F-16=10.42, P less than or equal to 0.005, respectively). A
   multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) distinguished effects of
   Silphium integrifolium (Wilk's lambda P=0.029) from echoes of earlier
   winter granivory (Wilk's lambda P=0.014). Thirty months after rodent
   exclusion, diversity (D) remained 27\% higher in plots once opened to
   winter granivory (adjusted mean 4.70 +/- 0.37 SE) as compared with
   closed plots (3.70 +/- 0.26; F-1,F-16=5.12, P < 0.05). Echoes of earlier
   granivory remained after rodent-induced imbalances in the abundances of
   the competitive driver of this system, Silphium integrifolium, all but
   disappeared.}},

Abstract = {{Concerns over the relative stability or sensitivity of biologically
   diverse ecosystems in relation to environmental change include the
   effects of land-use intensification on diverse plant communities. This
   paper examines the sensitivity of a floristically diverse flood-meadow
   under hay-cutting management to nitrogen enrichment, this being a key
   component of intensified agricultural management. A gradient of
   fertilizer nitrogen treatments was applied to a site in the Czech
   Republic in two successive seasons and plant community response was
   monitored using measures of species diversity, cover and above-ground
   primary production. Results show that diversity was supported by annual
   hay-cutting management and that the community was highly sensitive to
   nitrogen enrichment. Fertilization at rates consistent with intensive
   agricultural practice reduced species richness significantly within
   eight weeks, with forbs and moss particularly susceptible. The cover and
   biomass of some grasses were stimulated by fertilization until
   constrained by litter accumulation. Over two seasons, fertilization
   significantly reduced species diversity and simplified community
   structure as inter-specific competitive relations shifted. Biologically
   diverse flood-meadows therefore seem to be vulnerable to agricultural
   intensification and other human activities that promote enhanced
   nitrogen levels.}},

Abstract = {{The existing Mistbelt grassland in the Umvoti Conservancy in
   KwaZulu-Natal is highly fragmented due to intensive agricultural land
   use (plantations and pastures), with Mistbelt grassland now occupying
   less than 3.5\% of the area. Patch sizes range from a few hectares to
   less than 350ha in extent. The plant species composition of remnant
   patches was sampled and classified using TWINSPAN, and sward structure
   described in terms of basal cover, sward height, sward density, and
   aerial cover. Grassland patches were of two main types: (I) Themeda
   triandra grassland with dense basal cover and high species richness
   (19.4 +/- 1.77 species); and (ii) secondary grassland characterised by
   the absence of T. triandra and a high frequency of Hyparrhenia hirta.
   The species richness of the disturbed patches, particularly those in
   wetter areas, was poor (12.4 +/- 1.27 species). Arisitida junciformis
   was ubiquitous and has the potential to invade all grassland patches in
   the absence of appropriate fire and grazing management. Various
   numerical indices, calculated using FRAGSTATS, were used to quantify
   landscape heterogeneity. The question of connectivity was addressed by
   sampling a powerline servitude, which is a potential corridor through
   the area. This corridor could also possibly serve as a link through the
   conservancy between the adjacent Blinkwater Nature Reserve, which
   contains 492ha of pristine Mistbelt grassland, and the lower-lying
   Umvoti Vlei.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Changes in species richness and species turnover during secondary
   succession following experimental disturbance were studied in eight
   permanent plots in a species-rich dry heathkind in the southern part of
   the Czech Republic. The treatments applied were sod-cutting, burning,
   cutting of aboveground biomass, and control. The plots were sampled
   annually between 1992 and 2000; species richness was analysed at three
   scales, 25 cm x 25 cm, 1 m x 1 m, and 3 m x 3 m.
   Disturbances resulted in increased species richness. The highest
   vascular plant richness was attained during the secondary succession
   after sod-cutting, where species established on exposed bare ground.
   Less severe disturbances by burning and cutting also caused a slight
   increase in the number of vascular plant species. For bryophytes and
   lichens, the highest increase in the number of species was also found in
   the sod-cut plots, where all cryptogams were removed by the disturbance.
   At the scale of 3 in X 3 m, species richness of both vascular plants and
   cryptogams peaked in 1995-1996, i.e. 3-4 yrs after the disturbance, and
   slowly decreased or slightly fluctuated without any trend thereafter. At
   smaller scales it either peaked later or constantly increased over the
   entire observation period of 9 yrs. Species mobility, expressed as
   species accumulation over time, was lower than reported from grasslands.
   Rates of species turnover, calculated as Jaccard dissimilarity between
   pairs of consecutive years, corresponded across different scales. This
   implies, that successional dry heathlands have a higher small-scale
   mobility than heathlands which tire apparently stable at larger scale.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Sheep grazing was investigated as,in alternative to traditional
   management of meadows in the Krkonose Mts. Until the second World War
   these meadows were mown in mid-surnmer and grazed by cattle for the rest
   of the season. Subsequent abandonment of the meadows has resulted in
   decreasing species richness. Degradation phases of the former
   communities have been replacing the original species-rich vegetation.
   Significant changes were apparent six years after the introduction of
   sheep grazing. In grazed plots the proportion of dominant herbs
   (Polygonum bistorta and Hypericum maculatum) decreased and grasses
   (Deschampsia cespitosa, Festuca rubra, Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxonthum
   alpinum) increased. The increase in grasses was positively correlated
   with an increase in several herbs. The proportion of some herbs
   increased despite being selectively grazed (Adenostyles alliariae,
   Melandrium rubrium, Veratrum lobelianum). Any losses caused by grazing
   of mature plants were probably compensated by successful seedling
   establishment. Cessation of grazing resulted in significant changes in
   vegetation within three years. The cover of nitrophilous tall herbs and
   grasses (e.g. Rumex alpestris, Holcus mollis, Deschampsia cespitosa,
   Geranium sylvaticum) increased in the abandoned plots. In the plots
   grazed for nine years cover of species-rich mountain meadow species
   increased (e.g. fine-leaved grasses, Campanula bohenica, Potentilla
   aurea, Viola lutea, Silene vulgaris). The main conservation risk is the
   expansion of a competitive species with low palatability, Deschampsia
   cespitosa, This species can be suppressed by a combination of grazing
   and mowing. In order for grazing to be effective, the number of sheep
   should be proportional to meadow production. This may be difficult to
   maintain as production is variable and is impossible to predict at the
   beginning of a growing season. A large part of the biomass may thus
   remain intact in some years. Negative effects of grazing may be, at
   least partly, eliminated C by a combination of cutting and grazing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on vegetation dynamics on terrestrial, temperate
   grassland sites at the upper range of the productivity scale, i.e. on
   abandoned sewage fields (fields once used for waste water disposal) at
   Berlin-Blankenfelde, Germany. I studied regeneration and the influence
   of different management practices (removal of topsoil and mowing in late
   summer). Changes in species composition and cover were followed on
   permanent plots of 2m x 2m size through five years of vegetation
   development. At the outset of the experiment the abandoned fields were
   dominated by dense Urtica dioicalElymus repens stands. Species richness
   was 7 species/4m(2), and it remained low on unmanaged plots during the
   time of observation (7.6 species/plot in year 5). Removal of 20 cm of
   top soil caused a severe decline of Urtica and a large increase in
   species richness (21 species in year 1 after disturbance). Mowing was
   slightly higher compared with unmown plots on both initially excavated
   and unexcavated plots. Total cover was always near 100\% (except
   immediately after top soil removal), Colonization of bare soil was very
   rapid and in late summer of the first year after disturbance cover
   already increased towards 100\%. On all plots the vegetation was mostly
   dominated by perennial herbs and grasses. Winter season gaps are
   occupied by Galium aparine, a large-seeded annual scrambling climber.
   Monocarpic perennials behaved as winter annuals in most cases.
   Woody,species were inhibited by dense above-ground biomass and litter
   cover. The paper questions whether succession on abandoned sewage fields
   may proceed towards a woodland stage and advises how vegetation of such
   hyper-eutrophicated sites can be managed towards higher diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Grasshoppers are a dominant group of herbivorous insects throughout the
   world, and their high diversity, functional importance, sensitivity to
   disturbance and ease of sampling makes them potentially useful
   bioindicators for land management. In Australia, however, the dynamics
   of grasshopper assemblages are extremely poorly understood. Here we
   describe the responses of grasshopper (Acridoidea, Eumastacoidea and
   Tettigonioidea) assemblages in the Kakadu region of the Northern
   Territory, Australia to disturbance associated with mining. Three
   questions were addressed in this study: (i) do local grasshopper
   assemblages show consistent responses to disturbance?; (ii) can
   particular species or functional groups be identified that are reliable
   indicators of ecological disturbance?; and (iii) to what extent do the
   responses of grasshopper assemblages merely reflect those of vegetation?
   Grasshoppers were sampled at 26 sites located in and around the Ranger
   uranium mine, representing three habitat types with respect to degree of
   disturbance: (i) `natural' (10 sites representing a range of
   `undisturbed' savanna habitats); (ii) `disturbed' (10 sites representing
   a range of disturbances, but with soil intact); and (iii) `waste rock'
   (six sites undergoing rehabilitation on a constructed landform). A total
   of 56 grasshopper species in 46 genera was recorded during the study,
   with site species richness ranging from five to 20. There were no
   significant differences between habitat types in site species diversity,
   but multivariate analysis demonstrated a strong correspondence between
   grasshopper species composition and degree of habitat disturbance. Using
   Indicator Species Analysis, six species and one functional group were
   identified as significant indicators of habitat type in relation to
   disturbance. Grasshopper responses were correlated with that of
   vegetation, but grasshopper assemblages showed apparently meaningful
   differentiation among disturbed sites that was not evident on the basis
   of floristic data. Our results demonstrate that grasshopper assemblages
   respond to disturbances associated with human land use and that these
   responses do not simply reflect those of plants. Grasshoppers are
   therefore potentially useful bioindicators of ecological disturbance in
   Australia, but further work is required on the extent to which their
   responses reflect general ecological change.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of grassy woodlands in the Queensland subtropics was conducted,
   recording herbaceous species richness at 212 sites on three properties
   (2756 ha). A range of habitats typical of cattle grazing enterprises was
   sampled and site variables included lithology, slope position, tree
   density, soil disturbance, soil enrichment and grazing. Results were
   compared with a previously published survey of temperate grasslands.
   Lithology, slope position and tree density had relatively minor effects
   on plant species richness, although in both surveys there was some
   evidence of lower species richness on the more fertile substrates. Soil
   disturbance and soil enrichment significantly reduced the richness of
   native species in both surveys, while exotic species were insensitive
   (subtropics) or increased (temperate) with disturbance. Rare native
   species were highly sensitive to disturbances, including grazing, in the
   temperate study. Although some trends were similar for rare species in
   the subtropics, the results were not significant and there were complex
   interactions between grazing, lithology and slope position. Grazing did
   not have a negative effect on native species richness, except in the
   closely grazed patches within pastures, and then only on the most
   intensively developed property. At the scale recorded (30 m(2)), the
   native pastures, roadsides and stock routes sampled in the subtropics
   appear to be among the most species-rich grasslands ever reported, both
   nationally and globally. Native species richness was approximately 50\%
   higher than the temperate survey figures across all the comparable
   habitats. While there are no clear reasons for this result, potential
   explanations are proposed.}},

Abstract = {{In an eutrophic alluvial reed bed in western France, artificial
   disturbances (mowing) and natural disturbances (cattle, roebucks, boars,
   voles...) are very frequent. In order to mime these disturbances,
   experimental small-scale disturbances of various intensities were
   generated in April 1996 after the end of the winter flooding. The two
   first intensities of disturbances (I1 and I2) were created by herbicide
   contact (Round-up (R)) associated (I2) or not (I1) with litter removal.
   Intensity 3 (I3) corresponded to the mechanic removal of the top of the
   soil. In intensity 4 (I4), seed bank was removed by exporting the top 10
   cm of the soil. The size of disturbances (1 m(2)) was chosen to mime
   natural disturbances. Subsequent changes in cover, species composition
   and some diversity indexes (species richness, species diversity, spatial
   heterogeneity, evenness, dominance) were observed over one following
   vegetation cycle from May 1996 to August 1996 and compared to
   undisturbed vegetation. After four months of recolonisation,
   disturbances removed significantly species composition in disturbed
   areas. Plant recolonisation and plant diversity dynamics depended on the
   intensity of disturbances. The results showed the role of disturbances
   in plant diversity dynamics and in particular in the maintenance of
   biological diversity at the scale of the marsh. In the context of a
   gradient of disturbances intensities, the results confirmed the
   framework of the intermediate disturbance hypothesis (Connell 1978,
   Grime 1979, Huston 1979) which shows that species richness or diversity
   is maximum at an intermediate intensity of disturbances.}},

Abstract = {{I compared the endemism of four plant groups (Araceae, Bromeliaceae,

   disturbance, from undisturbed mature forest to disturbed forest (logged,
   grazed or burned), secondary forest, secondary scrub, ,and finally
   pasture, at 16 sites in the Bolivian Andes. I measured endemism as the
   mean inverse range size (number of 1 degrees cells) of all species per
   sturdy group encountered in each habitat and site. Overall, endemism was
   significantly higher in disturbed forest than in mature forest, but it
   declined in more strongly disturbed habitats To explain the relationship
   of range size to habitat disturbance, I propose that endemic species are
   somewhat competitively inferior to other co-occurring taxa, limited in
   their ability to establish and maintain new populations following
   dispersal and thus to expand their ranges. within their established
   ranges endemic species depend on natural habitat disturbances to prevent
   their competitive exclusion by other species, so they profit from a
   certain level of anthropogenic disturbance. This pattern and the
   explanatory hypotheses should be subjected to critical evaluation.
   Although the pattern does not apply to every endemic tropical plant
   species, it indicates that conservation of part of the endemic tropical
   forest flora may be achieved in forest areas subject to sustainable
   forest use without the need to completely exclude human activities.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbance has profound effects on plant community composition. This
   paper deals with the influence of grazing on species richness and
   proportions of life-history attributes of grassland vegetation at six
   spatial scales (0.001-1000 m(2)) in two provinces of southern Sweden.
   The study comprised 33 dry grassland sites, including 22 grazed and 11
   abandoned localities, and 28 sites of coastal brackish meadows, divided
   into five management types (From ``heavily grazed{''} to ``abandoned
   since long time{''}).
   In general grazed sites were species-richer than abandoned sites;
   especially at small plot sizes. However, there was a steeper increase in
   species number rewards larger plot sizes in the abandoned sites. Heavy
   grazing in the coastal meadows resulted in a comparatively low number of
   species, corroborating the intermediate disturbance hypothesis.
   The analysis of life-history traits indicated the importance of
   taxonomic group, canopy structure, height, regenerative strategy and, in
   particular, life form. Leaf anatomy and seed dispersal seemed to be less
   important. The responses to grazing as regards species traits differed
   somewhat between grassland types. Grazed sites generally had high
   proportions of legumes, therophytes, species with basal position of
   leaves and with regeneration by means of a persistent seed bank.
   Abandonment of grazing favoured monocots, geophytes, species with
   vegetative regeneration and (partly) leafy canopy structure. Some
   differences between grazed and abandoned sites were confined to either
   the smallest or largest plot sizes, indicating different responses of
   matrix and interstitial species. Various positive associations
   (attribute syndromes) or negative associations between individual traits
   were identified. There was, for example, a positive link between the
   attributes ``geophytes{''} and ``ability of vegetative regeneration{''}.
   The recognition of such links is important to avoid misinterpreting
   certain attributes as functional adaptations to grazing while they are
   only positively correlated to other attributes of larger significance.}},

Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{1. Intensive agriculture often reduces biodiversity on farmed land, but
   the converse situation, of wildlife damaging agriculture, is also
   important. A striking example is agricultural damage by increasing
   populations of wild geese. Alternative feeding refuges, designed to
   reduce damage, will be most effective if the grass swards are made as
   attractive to geese as possible. This paper describes an explicitly
   experimental study in north-east Scotland during 1990-93, which
   investigated the effectiveness of different rates of application of
   nitrogenous fertilizer on the amount of grazing by pink-footed geese in
   spring, compared split-application with single-application of spring
   fertilizer, and evaluated the use of slow-release fertilizer in winter.
   2. The amount of goose grazing, measured from cumulative dropping
   density, increased with application rates of spring fertilizer, up to
   around 80 kg N ha(-1), in parallel with a similar increase in grass
   production. Beyond this level there was little further increase, and
   cost-effectiveness, measured as the percentage increase in dropping
   density per kg N ha(-1) applied, was greatly reduced.
   3. Dropping density and grass production did not differ significantly
   between split-application and single-application of spring fertilizer.
   Split-application should reduce the risk of nitrogen leaching in cold
   wet seasons, but the cost of application would be double that of
   single-application.
   4. Overall, cumulative dropping density and grass production in late May
   were not significantly greater in plots treated over the winter with
   slow-release fertilizer than in untreated plots. Dropping density was,
   however, higher in treated plots than in untreated ones during a short
   mild period in early spring. Slow-release fertilizer may be of benefit
   in mild winters, but is more expensive than conventional nitrogenous
   fertilizer.
   5. This study has shown that nitrogenous fertilizer can greatly increase
   goose grazing on sacrificial grassland refuges in spring and is a useful
   tool in reducing conflict between farmers and increasing goose
   populations.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{647-664}},

Abstract = {{1. The effects of agricultural intensification on biodiversity in arable
   systems of western Europe have received a great deal of attention.
   However, the recent transformation of grassland systems has been just as
   profound.
   2. In Britain, the management of grassland has changed substantially in
   the second half of the 20th century. A high proportion of lowland
   grassland is managed intensively. The major changes include a doubling
   in the use of inorganic nitrogen, a switch from hay to silage, and
   increased stocking densities, particularly of sheep. Structurally
   diverse and species-rich swards have been largely replaced by relatively
   dense, fast-growing and structurally uniform swards, dominated by
   competitive species.
   3. Most of these changes have reduced the suitability of grassland as
   feeding and breeding habitat for birds.
   4. The most important direct effects have been deterioration of the
   sward as nesting and wintering habitat, and loss of seed resources as
   food. Short uniform swards afford poor shelter and camouflage from
   predators, whereas increased mowing intensities and trampling by stock
   will destroy nests and young. Increased frequency of sward defoliation
   reduces flowering and seed set, and hence food availability for
   seed-eating birds.
   5. The indirect effects of intensification of management on birds relate
   largely to changes in the abundance and availability of invertebrate
   prey. The effects of management vary with its type, timing and
   intensity, and with invertebrate ecology and phenology, but, in general,
   the abundance and diversity of invertebrates declines with reductions in
   sward diversity and structural complexity.
   6. Low input livestock systems are likely to be central to any future
   management strategies designed to maintain and restore the ecological
   diversity of semi-natural lowland grasslands. Low additions of organic
   fertilizer benefit some invertebrate prey species, and moderate levels
   of grazing encourage sward heterogeneity.
   7. There is now a need to improve understanding of how grassland
   management affects bird population dynamics. Particularly important
   areas of research include: (i) the interaction between changes in food
   abundance, due to changes in fertilizer inputs, and food accessibility,
   due to changes in sward structure; (ii) the interaction between
   predation rates and management-related changes in habitat; and (iii) the
   impact of alternative anti-helminithic treatments for livestock on
   invertebrates and birds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is based on research of the restoration of species-rich
   calcareous grasslands in The Netherlands, over the last 30 years. Chalk
   grassland is a semi-natural vegetation with a high density of species at
   a small scale. This type of vegetation was once widespread in Western
   Europe as common grazing land, mainly for flocks of sheep for which the
   main function was dung production. In some regions of Central Europe,
   these grasslands were also used for hay production. The dung was used to
   maintain arable field production at a reasonable level. In the chalk
   district in the southernmost part of The Netherlands some 25 sites of
   this vegetation, varying in area from 0.05-4.5 ha, are still present.
   Chalk grassland completely lost its significance for modern agricultural
   production after the wide application of artificial fertilizer following
   World War II. This grassland has a high conservation value both for
   plants and animal species, of which a large number of species are
   exclusively restricted to this biotope. When conservation activities
   started at a large scale in the early 1960s, three different types of
   restoration activities could be distinguished: (1) restoration of
   fertilized sites; (2) restoration of abandoned grasslands; and (3)
   recreation of chalk grassland on former arable fields. The main aim of
   the restoration attempt is to create and/or improve sustainable
   conditions for both plant and animal species characteristic of the chalk
   grassland ecosystem. In the process of restoration, several phases of
   different activities can be distinguished: (1) pre-restoration phase,
   during which information of the land use history is collected and, based
   on these data, clear restoration goals are established; (2) initial
   restoration phase, during which effects of former, non-conservational
   land use has to be undone in order to stimulate germination and
   establishment of target species originating from soil seed bank and

Abstract = {{Grazing at low stocking rates has become a common management practice in
   nature restoration projects in the Netherlands. However, detailed
   knowledge of grazing impact is often poor, in particular for
   invertebrates. This study addressed the impact of extensive grazing on
   butterflies. Butterflies are critical indicators of habitat quality for
   many plant and animal species. We compared monitoring data from 1992 to
   1996 for calcareous coastal dune areas in the Netherlands with different
   management: 11 grazed areas, 7 ungrazed areas and 4 areas managed by
   annual cutting. Grazing typically concerned year-round grazing by cattle
   and/or ponies, at low stocking rates (0.05-0.26 head ha(-1) yr(-1)).
   Butterfly abundance was related to species composition and structure of
   the vegetation. Changes in butterfly abundance were positive in grazed
   and ungrazed areas compared to cut areas. Species richness was not
   affected by management, but individual species differed in their
   response. Species from open grassland benefited most from grazing,
   particularly Issoria lathonia (Queen of Spain Fritillary) and Lycaena
   phlaeas (Small Copper). No clear negative effects of grazing were
   observed, but species occurrence was not always positively related to
   the environmental characteristics associated with grazing. In the long
   run, even lower stocking rates might prove more beneficial to the
   butterfly community as a whole. Four of the more frequently observed
   species, I. lathonia, Hipparchia semele (Grayling), Pyrgus malvae
   (Grizzled Skipper) and Aricia agestis (Brown Argus), are listed as
   threatened to susceptible in the Netherlands. All were apparently
   favored by grazing. It is concluded that extensive grazing has good
   potential to enhance butterfly diversity in restoration projects.}},

Abstract = {{This review paper discusses the relevance and potential importance of
   food-feed systems in Asian agricultural systems, and in particular the
   role and contribution of legumes to these systems. A food-feed system is
   one that maintains, if not increases, the yield of food crops, sustains
   soil fertility, and provides dietary nutrients for animals. It involves
   a cropping pattern within which the feed crop has many beneficial
   effects without competing for land, soil nutrients and water with the
   food crops. The agricultural environment is described with reference to
   the priority ago-ecological zones and prevailing mixed farming systems
   in Asia. Within these systems, animal production is severely hampered by
   critical feed shortages which can however, be alleviated by the
   integration of suitable leguminous forages into the cropping systems.
   The review also focuses on the role and potential importance of
   leguminous forages in terms of biodiversity, their uses in farming
   systems, beneficial effects on animal performance, and draws attention
   to six case studies in different countries that clearly demonstrate many
   benefits of developing such food-feed systems. Considerable
   opportunities exist for widening the use of forage legumes in the
   development of systems with several complementary advantages (e.g.
   fenceline, cover crops, fodder banks, forage source and erosion control)
   to improve the development of sustainable crop-animal systems in Asia.}},

Abstract = {{Although theory predicts that large-scale factors will constrain
   small-scale interactions, the potential for small-scale events to impact
   large-scale patch structure is less clear. We examined experimentally
   the effects of urine deposition, a highly localized event, on small- and
   large-scale vegetation structure and spatial variation in tallgrass
   prairie. The response by vegetation to urine deposition may be mediated
   by grazing. Thus, we also determined the probability of urine patches
   serving as foci for grazing events by bison. Likelihood of bison grazing
   was much higher on vs. off urine patches, and grazed areas initiated on
   urine patches expanded well beyond the area of urine deposition.
   Abundance of four common graminoid species, and of all graminoids
   combined, increased on urine patches in ungrazed prairie. while the
   abundance of Andropogon gerardii and total graminoids decreased on urine
   patches in grazed prairie. The abundance of Aster ericoides, and all
   forbs combined, increased on urine patches in ungrazed, but not in
   grazed, prairie. Species richness and Shannon-Weiner diversity increased
   on urine patches in ungrazed prairie but were not affected by urine
   treatment in grazed prairie. Total spatial variance of graminoids
   increased relative to controls in response to urine treatment, grazing,
   and the combination of these treatments. For forbs, total variance
   increased marginally compared to controls only in response to urine
   treatment in ungrazed prairie. In combination, urine patches plus
   gracing produced unique large-scale patch structure compared to urine
   patches in ungrazed prairie. The most important impact of urine patches
   on community structure resulted from preferential grazing of urine
   patches by bison, which increases both the size and severity of the
   grazed area. Urine patches are thus an trample of a small-scale
   perturbation that generates larger-scale patch structure in tallgrass
   prairie.}},

Abstract = {{Green alder is a widespread shrub species in the Alps. The intense
   grazing practices of the last centuries relegated it to avalanche tracks
   on wet and steep slopes. However, it is currently colonizing abandoned
   meadows and pastures on relatively wet and drained soils at the
   subalpine and the montane belts, creating a dense shrub cover. The aim
   of this study is to assess the biodiversity changes induced during alder
   expansion by taxonomic and functional traits, using two representative
   taxa, i.e. vegetation and arthropods. The results show that the alder
   expansion strongly affects the 0.5-1m vegetation layer and the plant
   species richness as well as the biomass and composition of the
   arthropods active on the soil surface. Hymenoptera, Orthoptera and
   Coleoptera, which compose the major part of the athropod biomass,
   decline significantly as the green alder canopy grows. Such changes in
   specific and functional diversity may have strong effects on the
   ecosystem functioning and particularly on the maintenance of the habitat
   of several endangered species such as the black grouse (Tetrao tetrix
   L.). The impact of green alder on biodiversity must be taken into
   account as well as its functional role in the ecosystem before leading
   any management against its expansion. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All

Abstract = {{Two common but relatively untested approaches to prioritizing
   conservation areas involve identification of umbrella-species habitat
   and selection of large blocks of remaining natural vegetation. We tested
   an umbrella-species approach to identification of conservation areas in
   the Agassiz Beach Ridges landscape of Minnesota based on the habitat
   needs of the Greater Prairie Chicken (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus). All
   natural vegetation patches that fell within 1.6 km of prairie chicken
   booming grounds were selected as conservation priorities and were
   compared with randomly selected vegetation patches. Patches selected by
   the umbrella-species approach encompassed slightly more biologically
   important land (59\%) than selection of the largest patches (56\%), and
   both these sets contained more biologically important land than randomly
   selected patches (47\%). The set of largest natural vegetation patches
   encompassed the greatest number of natural community types (12 of 16
   possible). Patches selected by the umbrella-species approach encompassed
   more occurrence (individual locations) of species and communities than
   both other approaches. Using the habitat requirements of prairie chicken
   to identify conservation area adequately addressed other grassland
   species and communities but not uncommon forested habitats. In many
   cases, the large-patch approach did equally well or better at protecting
   various biodiversity components, indicating that the umbrella-species
   and large-patch approaches are complementary in this landscape. Because
   we had long-term information on our umbrella species, we were able to
   explore the setting of conservation priorities using different levels
   and types of data. As expected, increasing the number of booming grounds
   by combing years of data (n = 25 to n = 337) generally increased the
   number and area of selected vegetation patches and the number of
   occurrences and amount of biologically important land contained within
   them. We also found that data sets with the fewest booming grounds often
   produced the most efficient results, such as most biologically important
   land per unit area selected. We observed that stable booming grounds
   were more efficient in incorporating other components of biodiversity
   per unit area of selected habitat than were temporary booming grounds.
   These results demonstrate that the quantity and quality of data on
   umbrella species will greatly affect planning results.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the changes of species-rich herbaceous community canopy
   structure and species diversity in a five-year field experiment. Above-
   and below-ground resource addition (fertilization and additional
   illumination with the help of mirrors) and cessation of annual mowing
   were applied as experimental treatments in 24 permanent plots of 40 x 40
   cm. Canopy structure was studied by point quadrat sampling using laser
   beam to randomly position point quadrats at two different angles of
   observation -60 degrees and 120 degrees from horizontal, north-south
   direction. We hypothezised that the studied plant community is not
   light-limited under the normal conditions (non-fertilized and annually
   mown) but would become light-limited after nutrient addition and/or
   cessation of mowing. In this case the effect of fertilization and
   cessation of mowing could be mitigated by introducing additional light
   resource (placing south-facing mirrors).
   Species richness in plots was not significantly altered by experimental
   treatments, most probably because of a strong input of species from
   surrounding areas by the means of lateral vegetative spread,
   compensating for the expected decrease of diversity with fertilization
   and cessation of mowing. Surprisingly, plant total coverage in a plot
   was the only variable significantly explaining plot richness,
   independent of experimental treatments and the year of observation. We
   therefore studied also species richness per unit coverage (standardized
   richness) which appeared to be significantly reduced by fertilization.
   Annual change of plant total coverage of a plot was good predictor of
   annual change of plot richness, except for the exceptionally dry period
   (1994-1995). There was no indication of light being limiting for the
   plants in control plots, but light obviously became limiting after
   nutrient addition-in fertilized plots additional illumination lead to a
   notably denser canopy. Generally, the average exposition of plant leaves
   surface was towards the north, independent of experimental treatments.
   However, in the exceptionally cloudy and cool year 1996 the situation
   was radically different-leaves were exposed predominantly towards the
   south, indicating that multi-species canopy can plastically react to
   long-term changes in light availability.}},

Abstract = {{1. Natural, semi-natural and artificial grasslands occur extensively
   around the globe, but successful management for production and
   biodiversity poses several dilemmas for conservationists and farmland
   managers. Deriving from three continents (Africa, Australia and Europe),
   papers in this Special Profile interface three specific issues: plant
   responses to grazing, plant invasions and the responses to management of
   valued grassland biota.
   2. Although pivotal in grassland management, plant responses to grazing
   are sometimes difficult to predict. Two alternative approaches are
   presented here. The first uses natural variations in sheep grazing
   around a water hole to model the dynamic population response of a
   chenopod shrub. The second analyses a long-term grazing experiment to
   investigate the links between plant traits and grazing response.
   3. Linked often crucially with grazing, but also driven sometimes by
   extrinsic factors, invasions are often cause for concern in grassland
   management. The invasions of grasslands by woody plants threatens
   grassland habitats while the invasions of pastures by alien weeds
   reduces pasture productivity. The papers in this section highlight how a
   complementary range of management activities can reduce the abundance of
   invaders. A final paper highlights how global environmental change is
   presenting new circumstances in which grassland invasion can occur.
   4. The impact of grassland management on biodiversity is explored in
   this Special Profile with specific reference to invertebrates,
   increasingly recognized both for the intrinsic conservation value of
   many groups and for their role in ecosystem processes. The potential for
   manipulating flooding in wet grasslands to increase the soil
   invertebrate prey of wading birds is illustrated, together with the
   roles of management and landscape structure in enhancing insect
   diversity.
   5. In the face of climate change and growing demands for agricultural
   productivity, future pressures on grassland ecosystems will intensify.
   In this system in which productivity and conservation are so closely
   bound, there is a need both to raise the profile of the issues involved,
   and to improve our understanding of the applied ecology required for
   successful management.}},

Abstract = {{1. There are few long-term experimental studies of plant community
   responses to changes in grazing intensity. Here we report species'
   changes in a mesotrophic grassland after 12 years of a grazing
   experiment and relate these changes to species' life-history traits.
   2. The experiment was set up in 1986 on an extensified species-poor
   grassland in lowland UK. Treatments comprised sheep grazing vs. no
   grazing in winter, grazing vs. no grazing in spring, and two grazing
   intensities in summer, in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design with two
   replicate blocks.
   3. Point quadrat surveys in 1998 showed responses to grazing treatments
   by 17 of the 22 most common species. Species showed different responses,
   many of which were specific to a grazing season. Community changes were
   similar under spring and winter grazing, but the heavier summer grazing
   had different consequences. Species richness was increased by spring
   grazing, decreased by heavier summer grazing and unaffected by winter
   grazing.
   4. More species responded to treatments in the 1998 survey compared with
   a survey in 1990. Furthermore, the whole experimental grassland had
   changed between the surveys, probably as a result of falling soil
   fertility. The two dominant grasses had declined drastically and most
   other species had increased in abundance. Five new species were found in
   1998.
   5. Intensive surveys of dicotyledonous species hi 1998 showed five of
   the 12 most common species had responded to grazing treatments. In most
   cases dicotyledonous species had increased in abundance under heavier
   grazing in one or more season, and species richness was increased by
   spring and winter grazing. Compared with a 1991 survey, the number of
   species responding to treatments had increased by 1998 and seven new
   species were found.
   6. We tested whether species' responses to grazing were linked to
   life-history traits according to three hypotheses: that heavier grazing
   would disadvantage (i) species grazed preferentially, (ii) species less
   able to colonize gaps or (iii) more competitive species. Mechanisms
   differed among seasonal treatments. Responses to heavier summer grazing
   were linked strongly to gap colonization ability. Responses to spring
   and winter grazing were positively related to grazer selectivity, a
   surprising result that might be explained if selectivity was positively
   related to plant regrowth ability.
   7. This study shows the need for long-term experimental analyses of
   community responses to grazing as vegetation responses may develop over
   a long time. The traits analysis suggests it may be possible to predict
   changes in species composition under grazing through an understanding of
   the mechanisms of plant responses. Grassland managers require such
   information in order to manipulate grazing regimes to achieve, for
   example, diversification or weed control.}},

   the intake of 4 non-breeding mares of a heavy breed (average body weight
   = 674 kg), grazing during the summer in heterogeneous natural grasslands
   of the Marais Poitevin (France), an internationally important wetland
   where grazing is an essential process which maintains biodiversity. The
   mares ate large quantities of forage (21.9 +/- 2.4 kg of organic matter
   per day, i.e. 166.2 +/- 20.8 g of organic matter per kg LW0.75 per day)
   in comparison with previous published values and with the estimated

   selective, the mares spent about 70\% of their feeding time on short
   grass lawns (sward surface less than or equal to 4 cm, biomass < 100

Abstract = {{The Afromontane region of South Africa is characterised by numerous
   small, remnant forests in a grassland matrix. The edges, or ecotones
   between forests and grasslands are usually sharp (typically just over a
   few metres) and are mainly maintained by both natural and, more
   recently, anthropogenic fires. We investigated epigaeic amphipod,
   carabid and ant distribution patterns across Afromontane
   forest/grassland ecotones and found little evidence to support the
   biological edge effect. Five of the fifty-two sampled species however,
   did increase significantly in abundance at the ecotone. Among these was
   a very distinct edge species, the amphipod Talistroides africana.
   Overall, carabids were more abundant and species rich in forests while
   for ants it was in the grasslands. Ants and carabids were both more
   abundant and species rich in spring and summer than in autumn and
   winter. More interestingly, the abundance and species richness patterns
   across the ecotone did not change with the passing of the seasons. We
   argue that a conservation strategy for the Afromontane forest patches
   must also incorporate the surrounding grassland. The grassland habitat
   is often perceived as less valuable than forest and, as a consequence,
   is subject to many anthropogenic disturbances such as fragmentation,
   cattle grazing and afforestation. Protecting grasslands around forest
   patches not only conserves the rich ant diversity, but also conserves
   the biota in the forests and at the edges, and would therefore be more
   meaningful in terms of the overall conservation of Afromontane
   biodiversity.}},

   cropland sites across Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba between 25 May
   and 3 July 1998. PCP sites showed higher avian species richness than
   cropland, and nine of 10 commonly detected grassland bird species
   occurred at higher frequencies in PCP than cropland. PCP sites were
   characterized by taller, denser vegetation and less bare ground than
   cropland sites. Hayed and grazed PCP sites differed significantly in
   their vegetative structure and avian community composition, but did not
   differ in species richness or evenness. Mean bird species richness at
   both cropland and PCP sites was significantly lower in the aspen
   parkland ecoregion than in the mixed and moist-mixed grassland
   ecoregions. Logistic regression identified 18 geographic and vegetative
   variables that significantly influenced the occurrence of individual

Abstract = {{Although the maintenance of biodiversity has become one of the goals in

   characteristics such as level of herbivory, productivity, and vegetation
   structure are still poorly understood, We examined these relationships
   in 8 native grassland sites differing in grazing histories and range
   condition in the Mixed Grassland (6), Moist Mixed Grassland (1) and
   Aspen Parkland (1) ecoregions of southern Saskatchewan. Range condition,
   assessed using standard methods, ranged from fair to excellent. The
   Shannon's diversity index followed a curvi-linear relationship with
   range condition, increasing from fair to good, but decreasing from good
   to excellent condition, within a range between 0.66 and 2.58. Species
   evenness was affected by range condition in a similar manner ranging
   from 0.44 to 0.86, Species richness varied among sites and plots between
   4 and 28 plants 0.25 m(-2), but changed little with range condition.
   Most structural parameters, such as the cover, height, or thickness of
   standing plants (live or dead) and litter, increased with range
   condition especially from good to excellent. The Shannon's diversity
   index was positively correlated with forb biomass, but not with biomass

Abstract = {{The change in plant species relative abundance under different
   fertiliser and management inputs over 19 years is reported for two
   grazed multiple-species trials on a Pukaki/Tekapo high-country soil. One
   trial was 30 combinations of 5 superphosphate rates (0-500 kg ha(-1)
   yr(-1)) x 3 stocking rates x 2 stocking methods, and the second was 31
   combinations of S, P (0-100 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), and micronutrient
   fertilisers. Both were overdrilled with a 25-species pasture mixture.
   There was rapid initial separation in relative abundance of species,
   principally according to fertiliser level. Main features were Hieracium
   pilosella remaining dominant in the absence of fertiliser; the initial
   success of Trifolium hybridum; the dominance and long-term persistence
   of Lupinus polyphyllus at low fertiliser inputs; the transition to
   Dactylis glomerata dominance at high fertiliser inputs following a
   legume phase, in the middle years; the slow vegetative increase of
   Trifolium ambiguum to become dominant in most of the moderate and high
   fertiliser treatments in the second decade; and the increase of Bromus
   tectorum in later years. Species distributions were predominately
   determined by P fertiliser rates, or P by S fertiliser interactions. The
   effects of different grazing managements on late spring pasture
   composition were small during the first decade but increased over time,
   with the principal changes under moderate to high rate set-stocking.
   Diversity considerations showed that the number of vascular plants in a
   plot (n), or their proportional distribution in biomass (k diversity),
   gave only a weak and inconsistent con elation with secondary production
   (mean sheep carrying capacity), or its stability (CV of annual grazing
   capacity), after fertiliser and grazing management treatment effects
   were considered. The only significant trend was in one trial where
   production tended to be inversely related to the number of plant species
   (2.2\% decrease per species).}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Herbivores affect vegetation in a variety of ways. involving both
   trophic and ecosystem engineering interactions, but the study of these
   different interaction types has rarely been integrated. The aim of this
   study was to investigate both the trophic and engineering effects of
   herbivores on plant communities in the Negev desert, Israel, and to
   promote an integrative approach to the study of herbivore effects in
   ecosystems. First, we summarise previous studies of the Indian crested
   porcupine (Hystrix indica), which show that in digging for food,
   porcupines excavate soil pits, which accumulate resources and seeds
   resulting in marked changes in plant species richness, density and
   biomass. By contrast, their trophic effect, via consumption of bulbs,
   has little impact on populations of perennial plants. Second, we present
   an empirical study of the trophic and ecosystem engineering effects of
   harvester ants (Messor spp.). An exclusion experiment, using barriers to
   restrict ant access, failed to reveal any significant effect of seed
   collection by harvester ants on plant species incidence (proportional
   occurrence in samples) or abundance (number of individuals). However, we
   show that vegetation on nest mounds of M. ebeninus differs in plant
   density, species richness and biomass from that on undisturbed soil. An
   analysis of incidence and abundance responses of individual plant
   species suggests that the observed differences in vegetation resulted
   from multiple interacting mechanisms. The case studies highlight that
   many interactions between herbivores and plant communities can occur
   simultaneously, and that ecosystem engineering and trophic processes can
   be closely associated. resulting from single actions of herbivores. We
   propose a conceptual framework that classifies the range of possible
   trophic and engineering interactions between herbivores and plant
   communities with respect to the level of association between trophic and
   engineering effects. The framework is presented as an aid to the design
   and interpretation of studies of interactions between herbivores and
   plant communities, and promotes integrative research into the roles of
   herbivores in ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Management is necessary for the conservation of limestone grasslands.
   However, the traditional management of hay-making every year in July is
   no longer profitable for farmers. Hence many species-rich grasslands
   have become abandoned. The aim of this study is (a) to investigate the
   consequences of abandonment (as compared with annual mowing) on the
   availability of soil nutrients, and (b) to determine the type of
   nutrient limitation. The soil was taken from a long-term experimental
   site set up 22 years ago in northern Switzerland. The availability of
   soil N and P was assessed in a bioassay where soil from mown and unmown
   plots was supplied with different nutrient solutions or deionised water
   as control. Seedlings of Galium mollugo s.str. L. and Raphanus sativus
   ssp. oleiferus (DC) Metzg. were used as phytometer plants. Their growth
   in the control treatment was limited by N and P almost to the same
   extent, indicating that the availability of both elements was very low
   in this soil. P limited plant growth slightly more, but was overcome in
   the case of Raphanus by a high P content in the seeds. The N and P
   availability responded differently to management. The availability of N
   was slightly higher in soil from the abandoned plots, whereas the P
   availability did not differ significantly. Accumulation of nitrogen in
   the soil after abandonment did presumably not have any decisive effect
   on the vegetation because the amount was small and because the
   vegetation seemed primarily P-limited. The direct effect of mowing or
   abandonment on plants is therefore likely to be much more important for
   species composition than the minor changes in soil nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{This paper documents changes in the floristic composition of Eucalyptus
   marginata Donn (jarrah) woodlands over 7 years of recovery from
   continual, intensive livestock grazing. In remnants of native woodland
   left after agricultural clearing, which have been subjected to livestock
   grazing, comparisons were made between the floristics of fenced
   exclosure plots and open plots that continued to be grazed. The
   vegetation in nearby remnants, which had not been subjected to livestock
   grazing, was also surveyed. An initial increase in annual exotic pasture
   species after grazing relief was only temporary and highly influenced by
   fluctuations in annual climatic patterns, particularly rainfall
   distribution and abundance. Subsequent years saw a decrease in exotic
   annuals in exclosure plots and an increase in native perennials, in a
   trend towards becoming more floristically similar to the ungrazed sites.
   Germination of overstorey species was observed in the exclosure plots,
   however, development of seedlings and saplings was sparse. Results
   indicate that for jarrah woodland in southwestern Australia, natural
   regeneration is possible after the removal of livestock, with the return
   (within 6 years) of native species richness to levels similar to those
   found in ungrazed vegetation. Re-establishment of cover, however,
   appears to take longer. The floristic dynamics are described in terms of
   a nonequilibrium model. Two vegetation states exist, degraded remnants
   with an understorey dominated by annual species, and ungrazed vegetation
   with an understorey dominated by perennial shrubs and herbs. The former
   state is maintained by continual heavy grazing by livestock. Upon relief
   from grazing, the vegetation undergoes a transition towards floristic
   similarity to ungrazed vegetation. After 6 years, vegetation change in
   the exclosure plots appears to be continuing and therefore it is still
   in transition.}},

Abstract = {{The cessation of coppicing and grazing in Quercus woodlands, with its
   subsequent changes in the structure, composition and functioning of
   vegetation communities, is becoming more frequent throughout the
   Mediterranean Basin. In southern France, we have studied successional
   changes in Quercus pubescens woodlands by visiting previously studied
   sites 18 yr later. Changes in vertical structure, species richness,
   floristic composition, life form and dispersal type were analysed and
   compared between woodlands that had previously been grazed or ungrazed.
   Both successions showed a decline in vegetation cover in the 0-25 cm
   height class and in the height class immediately under the canopy layer,
   due to oak litter accumulation and tree ageing. In post-grazing
   succession, the abandonment of grazing and associated burning has
   allowed the vegetation cover to increase in the 0.25-2 m height class.
   In both successions, grassland species decreased in frequency and forest
   species increased, a trend which was stronger in undisturbed succession.
   Species richness decreased with time in the undisturbed succession, but
   remained stable in the post-grazing succession mainly because of the
   slow decline of plants linked to grazing. In undisturbed succession,
   therophytes and hemicryptophytes decreased. In contrast, therophytes and
   hemicryptophytes remained stable in post-grazing succession. In both
   successions, endozoochorous species (notably Ruscus aculeatus)
   increased. Plants dispersed by non-animal vectors decreased in
   undisturbed succession, but stability was observed in most of the
   dispersal types in post-grazing succession. These results showed that a
   time-lag existed between undisturbed succession and post-grazing
   succession, the latter remaining at a younger stage of successional
   development due to more recent impact of grazing. However, both
   successions have converged suggesting that most of the traces of grazing
   on vegetation will disappear within a few years. The vegetation of these
   coppices, regardless of the previous grazing regime, will become
   increasingly similar to the vegetation of undisturbed woodlands.
   However, their floristic composition will probably never be identical to
   that of undisturbed woodlands, mainly because of the rarity of these
   undisturbed woodlands and of the short-distance dispersal of many forest
   plant species.}},

   Signalized are also some vegetation transformations in the remaining
   belts. The progressing floristic degradation of plant communities in.
   the subalpine and alpine belts consists in: (a) expansion of grasses,
   (b) decline of rare vascular plants, and (c) elimination of terricolous
   bryophytes and lichens. In spruce forest belts declining are species
   connected with old-growth spruce forests like: Listera cordata and
   Moneses uniflora. The changes of plant communities of low mountain
   swards (Nardetalia) caused by cessation of pasture and mowing in the
   cause of retreat of many rare plants, like e.g., Arnica montana. The
   main cause of the still lasting in the Karkonosze Mts. community
   transformations is the changes in soil environment connected with
   anthropogenic nitrogen fertilization. The large inflow of mineral
   nitrogen from the atmosphere (1138 mg/m(2) sum for vegetation season) is
   the reason of accelerated rate of decomposition of organic matter and
   intensified nitrification. ne high content of nitrates in soil (5 times
   higher than in the Tatra Mts. swards) is the reason of expansion of
   graminoids, mainly Deschampsia flexuosa, Calamagrostis villosa and Carex
   bigelowii subsp. rigida. The over-fertilisation of habitats causes the
   retreat of rare high mountain vascular plants and the decline of

Abstract = {{To reduce the environmental burden of agriculture, suitable methods to
   comprehend and assess the impact on natural resources are needed. One of
   the methods considered is the life cycle assessment (LCA) method, which
   was used to assess the environmental impacts of 18 grassland farms in
   three different farming intensities - intensive, extensified, and
   organic - in the Allgau region in southern Germany. Extensified and
   organic compared with intensive farms could reduce negative effects in
   the abiotic impact categories of energy use, global warming potential
   (GWP) and ground water mainly by renouncing mineral nitrogen fertilizer.
   Energy consumption of intensive farms was 19.1 GJ ha(-1) and 2.7 GJ
   t(-1) milk, of extensified and organic farms 8.7 and 5.9 GJ ha(-1) along
   with 1.3 and 1.2 GJ t(-1) milk, respectively Global warming potential
   was 9.4, 7.0 and 6.3 CO2-equivalents ha(-1) and 1.3, 1.0 and 1.3
   CO2-equivalents t(-1) milk for the intensive, extensified and organic
   farms, respectively. Acidification calculated in SO2-equivalents was
   high, but the extensified (119 kg SO2 ha(-1)) and the organic farms (107
   kg SO2 ha(-1)) emit a lower amount compared with the intensive farms
   (136 kg SO2 ha(-1)). Eutrophication potential computed in
   PO4-equivalents was higher for intensive (54.2 kg PO4 ha(-1)) compared
   with extensified (31.2 kg PO4 ha(-1)) and organic farms (13.5 kg PO4
   ha(-1)). Farmgate balances for N (80.1, 31.4 and 31.1 kg ha(-1)) and P
   (5.3, 4.5 and -2.3 kg ha(-1)) for intensive, extensified and organic
   farms, respectively, indicate the different impacts on ground and
   surface water quality. Analysing the impact categories biodiversity,
   landscape image and animal husbandry, organic farms had clear advantages
   in the indicators number of grassland species, grazing cattle, layout of
   farmstead and herd management, but indices in these categories showed a
   wide range and are partly independent of the farming system. (C) 2001

Abstract = {{Latin American pastures usually include trees that may be important in
   sustaining productivity and conserving resources and biodiversity. A
   participatory survey of trees in seasonally dry pastures of 54 farms in
   the Caribbean region of Colombia, followed by cluster and correlation
   analyses, revealed a multistrata configuration. Trees of large stature
   (e.g., Tabebuia rosea, Albizia caribaea and Sterculia apelata) provided
   shade and produced timber. The most important fodder trees were those of
   medium stature (Albizia saman, Guazuma ulmifolia, and Cassia grandis)
   that produced fruits or pods, while other species were managed as shrubs
   producing green leaf fodder (e.g., Crescentia cujete and Gliricidia
   sepium, which was also ubiquitous as living fence posts). Trees were
   present on between 26 and 69\% of the pastures on each farm, at
   densities varying from less than 3 to more than 50 trees ha(-)1. There
   were more trees in drier areas, of lower fertility, with extensive
   grazing, where milk as well as meat was produced. Most farmers planted
   timber trees, encouraged regeneration of fodder trees, and knew about
   fodder species preferences of cattle and the effects of trees on pasture
   and animal productivity. Their knowledge of tree phenology was less
   certain and varied even amongst farmers in similar locations. There is
   scope to develop silvopastoral systems with woody species familiar to
   farmers, but it is critical to determine how important different
   vegetation strata are for sustainability of cattle production. An
   experiment has been established to achieve this, with treatments based
   on an analysis of how trees are presently used on farms in the region.}},

Abstract = {{Frequent burning and grazing and cultivation of cash crops increasingly
   threaten forest patches in hilly grassland in Northeast Luzon, yet their
   importance as a resource with multiple environmental functions and
   forest products persists. The aim of this study is to identify different
   types of forest patches, and their condition under present land-use
   intensification, and discuss prospects for their integration into
   sustainable local farming systems. Five types of forest patches are
   distinguished, both natural and planted ones, including rows of trees,
   woody patches, gallery forests, hill-slope forests and homegarden
   conglomerations. Natural woody patches and gallery forests in Imperata
   grassland are subject to degradation and land-use conversion under
   conditions of agricultural intensification. Woody patches in grassland
   affected by frequent burning and grazing cover small areas (66\% below
   50 m(2) as opposed to 28\% in protected grassland) and contain
   relatively few woody plant species (25 woody species in total as opposed
   to 82 where protected). Yet where well managed, they may provide a
   variety of products for sale and subsistence, covering emergency needs
   and giving off-season cash income to rural communities. Moreover they
   serve like the gallery forest various ecological functions, carrying
   valuable indigenous tree species, retaining soil base nutrients,
   providing a continuous supply of organic matter and intercepting fine
   earth soil particles removed from bare surfaces. It is suggested that
   forest- patch management systems may be developed, taking into account
   both patch diversity and the diverse needs of rural communities, and to
   strengthen existing and undervalued functions of forest patches as
   permanent elements in an agricultural landscape.}},

Abstract = {{The vegetation of four grazed and five ungrazed shore grasslands was
   studied in seashore and in delta on the southwestern coast of Finland.
   Ordinations and classifications separated delta plots from seashore
   plots, which were further divided into reed stand plots, epilittoral
   plots and geo- and hydrolittoral plots. The partitions reflected
   flooding stress, moisture conditions, grazing and properties of parent
   material. Elevation explained the data best. The primary factor in
   producing the vegetation zonation pattern in these Baltic coastal
   grasslands is the short-term fluctuation in sea-level. Although grazing
   was not the most important factor for explaining the variability in the
   data, its impact on the vegetation was considerable. Phragmites
   australis was much more common in ungrazed than in grazed plots. It
   dominated the hydrolittoral, was abundant in geolittoral and existed
   even in transition zone of the ungrazed transects. In grazed transects
   Agrostis stolonifera and Eleocharis uniglumis dominated the
   hydrolittoral. The lower geolittoral was dominated by perennial
   graminoids. In the middle and upper geolittoral, forbs were more
   frequent and abundant. In the grazed seashore transects, the lower
   geolittoral was dominated by Juncus gerardii, while in the ungrazed
   transects Calamagrostis stricta, Agrostis stolonifera and Juncus
   gerardii formed the zone together with Phragmites australis. The
   transition zone in the grazed transects was a narrow drift wall, in the
   ungrazed transects, however, it was much broader and dominated by tall
   growing plants. On fine-grained substrate, the epilittoral was dominated
   by Agrostis capillaris, Carex nigra and Deschampsia cespitosa and on

Abstract = {{The conservation of dry calcareous grasslands in the French Prealps
   strongly depends on the maintenance of low-intensity farming systems
   supported by agri-environmental schemes. An experimental assessment of
   the effect of current agro-pastoral management on the biodiversity of
   plant communities was conducted during a six-year permanent plot survey
   in four sites with contrasting habitat conditions (mesic to xeric).
   Analyses of species changes showed: (i) a strong increase in species
   richness and open grassland species frequencies four years after
   shrub-clearing, and (ii) a noticeable recovery of rare annuals and
   perennial species of conservation interest establishing in gaps created
   by grazing. At the community level, the restoration effect was evaluated
   by a between-year Correspondence Analysis, explaining 10.9\% of the
   total floristic variability versus 29.5\% for the site effect
   (between-site CA). Species ordination by between-year CA showed similar
   trajectories of vegetation changes during restoration despite different
   habitat conditions and grazing regimes between sites. The successful
   restoration of prealpine calcareous grasslands was explained by the
   availability of seed sources during the study in adjacent grazed or mown
   grasslands. Thus, restoration assessment should focus on dispersal
   possibilities and functional roles of species rather than species
   richness only. Finally, the spatial (i.e. the area of patches that need
   to be restored) and temporal (i.e. the frequency of shrub-clearing)
   implications for the large-scale conservation of prealpine calcareous
   grasslands by current agro-pastoral management are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{During 1990-1997, we recorded 122 138 adult butterflies in transect
   surveys at 125 pine-oak barrens in northern Wisconsin and 106 tallgrass
   prairies in six midwestern states grouped into three prairie subregions.
   Before analysis, we classified the butterflies into three ecological
   subgroups: specialist of native herbaceous vegetation, grassland (widely
   occurring in native and degraded herbaceous vegetation), and generalist.
   We analyzed this dataset both by ecological subgroups and as total
   butterflies, and by relative density and species richness, to
   investigate how these different ways of ordinating the same dataset
   might affect the results. In multiple linear regressions, density and
   richness of total butterflies and the subgroups related significantly to
   many non-management factors. In comparisons of more vs. less recent
   burning, all significant results for most recent burning were negative.
   No significant negative relationships were attributed to the longest
   period since burning. In comparisons of burning vs. idling, all
   significant results in prairie favored idling, but in barrens favored
   burning. In comparisons of burning vs. mechanical cutting, all
   significant results in prairie favored cutting, but no significant
   differences occurred in barrens. In regressions including all management
   types, rotational burning (alone or combined with cutting) was
   significantly positive most often for generalists and never for
   specialists. Increasing years since last management was always negative
   in barrens and the southern prairie subregion but always positive in the
   two northern prairie subregions. Significant management patterns
   occurred more often in prairie than barrens, which were less fragmented.
   Specialists were favored by grazing in one northern prairie subregion
   (but disfavored in the other), haying, single wildfire (testable in
   barrens only), and increasing years since last treatment in one northern
   prairie subregion (but disfavored in barrens). Within subregion and
   subgroup, significant management results for density and richness never
   conflicted, but density had more significant results than richness. In
   no instances were the signs opposite when total butterflies and/or any
   subgroup(s) significantly related to the same management factor in the
   same type of regression. But what was significant for one sample was
   often not for another. Thus, management favorable for specialists and
   total butterflies did not conflict, but the subgroups had varying
   degrees of sensitivity, rather than opposite responses. Since the
   specialist (and total) butterflies did not consistently favor one
   management type over another among subregions, caution should be used in
   preserve management, to avoid overreliance on one management type over
   others.}},

Abstract = {{The preservation of remaining semi-natural grasslands in Europe has a
   high conservation priority. Previously, the effects of artificial
   fertilisation and grazing intensity on grassland animal and plant taxa
   have been extensively investigated. In contrast, little is known of the
   effects of tree and shrub cover within semi-natural grasslands and
   composition of habitats in the surrounding landscape on grassland taxa.
   We evaluated the effect that each of these factors has on species
   richness and community structure of vascular plants, butterflies, bumble
   bees, ground beetles, dung beetles and birds surveyed simultaneously in
   31 semi-natural pastures in a farmland landscape in south-central
   Sweden. Partial correlation analyses showed that increasing proportion
   of the pasture area covered by shrubs and trees had a positive effect on
   species richness on most taxa. Furthermore, species richness of nectar
   seeking butterflies and bumble bees were negatively associated with
   grazing intensity as reflected by grass height. At the landscape level,
   species richness of all taxa decreased (butterflies and birds
   significantly so) with increasing proportion of urban elements in a
   1-km(2) landscape area centred on each pasture, while the number of
   plant and bird species were lower in landscapes with large proportion of
   arable fields. Our results differed markedly depending on whether the
   focus was on species richness or community structure. Canonical
   correspondence analyses (CCA) showed that the abundance of most taxa was
   ordered along a gradient describing tree cover within pastures and
   proportion of arable fields in the landscape. However, subsets of
   grassland birds and vascular plants, respectively, showed markedly
   different distribution patterns along axis one of the CCA. In contrast
   to current conservation policy of semi-natural pastures in Sweden, our
   results strongly advise against using a single-taxon approach (i.e.,
   grassland vascular plants) to design management and conservation actions
   in semi-natural pastures. Careful consideration of conservation values
   linked to the tree and shrub layers in grasslands should always precede
   decisions to remove trees and shrubs on the grounds of promoting
   richness of vascular plants confined to semi-natural grasslands.
   Finally, the importance of landscape composition for mobile organisms
   such as birds entails that management activities should focus on the
   wider countryside and not exclusively on single pastures.}},

Pages = {{1865-1873}},
Abstract = {{Species richness of vascular plants and birds were examined in relation
   to five types of management (including abandonment) of oak-hazel
   woodland in south-central Sweden. The biodiversity of this type of
   woodland is affected by lengthy management in contrast to present
   emphasis on the fragmentation of more or less pristine forests. The
   woodlands derive from old deciduous forests but were a source of
   agricultural commodities from medieval time to end of the 19th century.
   Vascular plants and birds were censused during spring-summer for four
   years. Total number of plant species, species of field layer forbs,
   breeding birds and migrant birds were more numerous at simulated
   original management with mowing of small interior grasslands than at
   mechanical clearing or abandonment. Summer grazing led to intermediate
   numbers. Exotic plants were more common at long-time abandonment.
   Species richness of trees and shrubs, graminoids, all spring birds,
   resident birds and non-passerine birds did not exhibit any difference
   between treatments. Inter-site variation in species richness was usually
   smaller at abandonment than at true management. Species richness of
   plants and birds showed positive correlation in the particularly large
   sites examined. The general findings were in accordance with the
   intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Original management would secure
   most potential plant and bird species but extensive cattle grazing would
   also retain many species.}},

Abstract = {{The human impact on the African savanna is parcelling large native
   mammals into game reserves, with cattle and other livestock replacing
   these native mammals in the matrix surrounding these reserves.
   Concordant with this are other landscape changes such as fire
   maintenance within the reserve but no longer outside. How does this
   composite landscape change affect biodiversity, as represented by small
   animals such as grasshoppers? This question was addressed against the
   premise that grasshoppers have evolved in the context of native mammal
   ecology. One of the most significant aspects of this ecology is grazing
   and trampling by the large number of ungulates congregating at
   waterholes. The results clearly show that the grasshopper fauna is only
   marginally impoverished outside the reserve, and that cattle trampling
   and grazing (along with less fire) is a simulation of these impacts by
   native ungulates. As greatest grasshopper diversity is encouraged by
   some trampling and grazing, the presence of cattle in place of native
   mammals is not entirely adverse to biodiversity, as represented by
   grasshoppers.}},

Journal = {{FLORA}},
Year = {{2001}},
Volume = {{196}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{180-193}},
Abstract = {{We examined patterns of bryophyte species richness and communities in 36
   montane calcareous fens in Switzerland. Sites differed in management
   regime (grazing vs, mowing) and altitude. In addition, several
   environmental variables were measured. Bryophyte diversity was
   determined as species density (mean of 5 plots per site), as species
   richness (number of all species of a site) and as beta -diversity.
   Species richness was 20\% higher at grazed than at mown sites. We
   interpret this as the result of higher environmental heterogeneity at
   grazed sites. This could also be the cause for the significantly higher
   beta -diversity at grazed sites. However, there was a significant
   management x altitude interaction caused by species-poor sites at low
   altitudes under grazing. This interaction might be caused by more
   intensive grazing at low altitude. Grazed sites contained the higher
   overall species richness (117 vs. 79), more exclusive species (47 vs.
   9), and more Red List-species (12 vs. 6). Altitude had only an effect on
   the number of exclusive species, which was highest at high-altitude
   sites.
   No differences could be found for species densities both between
   management regimes and between altitude classes. This result indicates
   no differences in habitat heterogeneity at the within-plot scale.
   For analysis of effects of environmental variables on bryophyte
   communities, we used a direct ordination technique (CCA). The variables
   pH, amount of total carbon in the soil and management turned out to be
   the most important in explaining variation in the species data. However,
   variation explained by total carbon could also be explained in terms of
   total nitrogen or moisture.
   For preserving bryophyte diversity in montane wet meadows, extensive
   grazing by cattle is crucial. Due to slightly different bryophyte
   communities under the different management regimes, however, bryophyte
   diversity at the landscape level will be highest when both types of
   management are maintained.}},

Abstract = {{Two blocks, each consisting of twelve 0.25 m(2) permanent plots (0.5 x
   0.5 m), were established in a community dominated by desert annuals in
   an area of Kuwait protected from grazing. Small-scale dynamics of desert
   annuals, cumulative species richness and inter-annual plot similarity
   were investigated in plots of both blocks in three growth seasons, 1997,
   1998 and 2000. The three study periods had different precipitation
   patterns in respect of the amount of rainfall received during the growth
   period, as well as the timing and amount of the first rains to trigger
   germination. In all three seasons, most species of the cumulative
   species pool (i.e. all species registered in each block during the study
   period) were rare, and of the more frequent ones, species turnover was
   generally high. High turnover is also reflected in a low inter-annual
   plot similarity. Stochastic climatic factors appear to play a major role
   in determining species composition and thus species turnover in a
   particular growth season. Species turnover, mediated by temporal niche
   partitioning, is generally regarded as an important factor in promoting
   coexistence in communities dominated by annuals in spatially uniform
   habitats. However, very high species richness in the particularly
   favourable growth season 1998, in which over 75\% of species of the
   cumulative species pool were recorded, suggests that in this desert
   ecosystem characterised by generally very low vegetation cover, the role
   of species turnover in maintaining diversity may not be as important as
   in other ecosystems dominated by annuals.}},

   three host species have a comparable pattern of richness of AM
   morphotypes with a single peak in the summer, possibly aligned with the

   biodiversity as a common-pool resource. The trend to intensified
   cultivation of restricted areas required fast action, while the
   sustainability of the program design had to take into account
   institutional diversity. Fifteen habitats and plant communities worth
   conserving were known, and 57 plant species were identified as indicator
   species for establishing an inventory and for monitoring purposes. A
   small subset of 16 well known plant species was presented to the farming
   communities. They were invited to notify the areas in which they
   observed the presence of these plants. In different regions of the
   Canton a total number of 39 paraecologists were trained to inspect the
   areas notified by farmers and to recommend possible incorporation into
   the Cantonal inventory. This was done once the farmers signed a contract
   in which they agreed to follow adequate management practices. The
   farmers received subsidies to compensate for their losses. Communal
   authorities controlled the fertilizer input and cutting dates, while the
   paraecologists were trained to monitor plant biodiversity. The program
   started in 1992 and the initial phase of the inventory was terminated in
   1996. At the beginning of 1996, an inventory of 2617.19 ha, most of
   which are meadows, was taken and managed according to the rules
   specified in the contract. The program was considered successful because
   (i) of the size of the area in the inventory, (ii) about 30\% of the
   farmers participated, and (iii) farmers started cultivating previously
   abandoned farmland.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies on grasslands demonstrate that species losses and
   subsequent changes in diversity can decrease the resilience (recovery
   ability) of ecosystems after a disturbance and can alter ecosystem
   functioning (e.g., productivity). These studies also explain that
   responses of ecosystems to environmental perturbation or species loss
   ultimately depend on individual species traits and species interactions
   within a community We conducted an experiment with 220 wetland mesocosms
   in summer 1998 to test whether species richness or presence of specific
   species of submersed aquatic plants (Potamogeton Pectinatzis L.,
   Potamogeton nodosus Poir., Potamoge ton crispus L., Zannichellia
   palustris L., and Ruppia maritina L.) affect the resilience of
   macrophyte above-ground biomass and total ecosystem respiration after
   disturbance (clipping). Neither respiration or final biomass were
   affected significantly by macrophyte species richness. Species richness
   also did not have a significant effect on the resilience of macrophyte
   biomass and system respiration. In contrast, the presence of specific
   species had significant effects on macrophyte biomass, respiration and
   the resilience of these processes. This study demonstrates that species
   roles and impacts need to be considered when assessing the effects of
   biodiversity loss on ecosystem functioning and resilience. This
   information is vital in the effective management, conservation,
   restoration, and creation of functioning wetlands.}},

Abstract = {{We studied vegetation change on 142 permanently marked transects spread
   throughout tussock grasslands of Otago and Canterbury, in areas subject
   to both pastoral and conservation management. The transects were
   established between 1982 and 1986 and remeasured between 1993 and 1999,
   providing a record of vegetation change at each site over an interval
   varying from 10 to 15 years. Each transect consisted of 50 quadrats,
   each 0.25m(2), in which the presence of all vascular plant species had
   been recorded. For each transect, we calculated the change between
   measurements in the mean number of species recorded per quadrat, and the
   change in the total number of species recorded per transect. Averaged
   across all transects, there was a significant decline in species
   richness between measurements at both the quadrat and transect scales.
   Small herbs (those less than or equal to2 cm tall, excluding Hieracium
   species) showed the greatest decline. On average, more than one quarter
   of the small herb species present in a quadrat at the first measurement
   had disappeared within 10 years. Larger herbs, ferns, rushes, sedges and
   grasses (excluding Chionochloa species) also declined significantly in
   species richness, reflecting declines in the abundance of species in
   these groups. Woody species richness remained constant, while species in
   the genera Chionochloa and Hieracium increased significantly in mean
   quadrat species richness, reflecting increases in the abundance of these
   species along transects. The rate of decline in mean quadrat species
   richness was unrelated to changes in the abundance of either Chionochloa
   or Hieracium species, or to an overall increase in total vegetation
   cover on transects. The rate of decline in species richness was also
   unrelated to the level of grazing or burning between measurements.
   However, the rate of decline in species richness was greater at lower
   elevation, on schist rock and on yellow-brown and yellow-grey soils. Our
   results suggest that a major compositional change is occurring in these
   grasslands at a rate that is independent of local variation in
   management and independent of the widespread invasion of these
   grasslands by Hieracium species.}},

Abstract = {{We analysed data from descriptive and experimental studies on the
   possible relationships between plants, nematodes and mycorrhizal fungi
   in (successional) plant communities in The Netherlands. A key role for
   pathogenic nematodes in cyclic succession in grazed grassland confirmed
   similar results in foredune succession. Plants with clonal growth forms
   appear to be particularly susceptible to pathogenic fungi. A large role
   for ectomycorrhiza at the species level (functional composition) was
   observed in determining the effects of acid rain and increased
   atmospheric CO2 on nutrient transfer to trees. Field studies showed a
   correlation between species richness of ectomycorrhizal fungi and
   hyphal-feeding nematodes in one case, but not in another. Population
   growth of hyphal-feeding nematodes on ectomycorrhizal hyphae was found
   to be strongly dependent on plant-mediated palatability of the fungus.
   We conclude that the limited available evidence suggests the importance
   of functional composition of species in determining interactions between
   plants, nematodes and mycorrhizal fungi, but the degree to which
   functional redundancy exists within the nematodes and within the
   mycorrhizal fungi warrants further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Protection of natural areas has caused the elimination of traditional
   grazing activity on many occasions. As a result, in Mediterranean
   ecosystems a loss of biodiversity is usually related to a decrease of
   grassland and grassland-bush mosaic areas. In order to establish
   relationships between land use and the relative importance of each type
   of habitat in terms of species richness and endemicity, the Font Roja
   Natural Park in Alicante Province (SE Iberian Peninsula) was studied.
   Four sites were selected representing the four different existing
   habitats: a wooded area (holm-oak forest), a dense shrubland, a dense
   grassland, and a grassland-shrubland mosaic area. In each site, the
   species composition of vegetation and dung beetle fauna were analysed.
   The results showed that the highest diversity and endemicity, for plants
   and beetles, were concentrated in the dense grasslands and the
   grassland-shrubland mosaic. Thus, controlled grazing activity of sheep
   and goats which maintained a diverse variegated landscape would favour
   the historical sustenance of the biodiversity of Mediterranean
   ecosystems, as that would allow a remarkable diversity of habitats with
   higher conservation levels of existing species richness and endemicity.
   Therefore, we propose a reintroduction of traditional grazing of sheep
   and goats throughout ecological, cultural and economical measures, which
   would include guidelines and regulations, set out to boost an integrated
   rural policy.}},

Abstract = {{In the Cerrado of Brazil, the largest Neotropical savanna region, open
   habitats are suffering an intense process of conversion to pasture and
   agricultural land. This study evaluated the responses of birds to the
   thinning of tree and shrub cover in plots of cerrado sensu stricto, the
   dominant habitat in the region, and examined whether disturbed plots
   supported bird communities of open natural habitats with similar
   structure. Birds were censused by point counts in five disturbed sites
   and in seven preserved patches, with a total of 304 samples of 20
   minutes in 68 points. Cleared plots were not suitable for species
   strongly dependent on trees and shrubs, such as frugivores and most
   insectivores. Their abundance was associated with the complexity of
   vegetation structure in these plots. Shrubby pastures held about 120\%
   more species than the traditional cleared ones. Bird communities of
   pastures showed large differences in relation to those of grasslands
   with similar structure. Communities of pastures were dominated by a
   seedeater, the Blue-black Grassquit Volatinia jacarina, and most species
   were habitat generalist or oportunistic predators, such as raptors and
   insectivores. Obligate grassland species, like the Grass Wren
   Cistothorus platensis, Cock-tailed Tyrant Alectrurus tricolor and
   Black-masked Finch Coryphaspiza melanotis, as well as other abundant
   species in grasslands, such as Sharp-tailed Grass-tyrant Culicivora
   caudacuta and Capped Seedeater Sporophila bouvreuil do not adapt to
   pastures. Grassland grasses probably do not recover spontaneously in
   abandoned pastures and in other agricultural lands. Thus, conservation
   of grassland birds will strongly depend on a urgent programme of
   identification and protection of large areas of Cerrado dominated by
   campo limpo and campo sujo. These species would also benefit from the
   maintenance of a band of grassland along gallery forests.}},

Title = {{Effects of late summer cattle grazing on the diversity of riparian
   pasture vegetation in an upland conifer forest}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{986-996}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{1. Species-rich grassland is important for biodiversity in upland
   forests, particularly within riparian zones. Prior to afforestation. the
   botanical diversity of these grasslands was maintained by domestic stock
   grazing, but without active management many will revert to coarse,
   species-poor grassland and eventually to scrub. The reintroduction of
   stock grazing is a potential solution to this problem, but has not been
   tested in upland forests. Here we present results from 9 years of
   monitoring the effects of cattle grazing on the diversity and
   composition of riparian pasture vegetation in an upland conifer forest
   in northern Scotland.
   2. There were two treatments, late summer grazing and ungrazed. The
   average stocking density in the grazed treatment was 2.25-2.5 cows
   ha(-1). The cattle were free to range over the entirety of the 40-ha
   experimental site from early August to late September each year.
   3. Assessments of plant species richness and abundance were made in 1988
   (prior to the commencement of grazing), 1991 and 1997, in three of the
   main riparian vegetation types. These were `Flush' vegetation associated
   with calcareous springs, acid Agrostis capillaris-Festuca ovina
   grassland ('Grass'), and Juncus effusus rush pasture ('Juncus').
   Assessments were also made of grazing impacts, cattle usage and water
   table depths.
   4. Grazing had a significant effect on plant species richness, which
   declined in ungrazed plots and remained static in grazed plots over the
   1988-97 period. There were no recorded effects of grazing on species
   abundance, nor on the frequency of rare sedges and herbs of particular
   conservation importance. Litter cover (dead plant material) was
   significantly higher in ungrazed plots, which may be a causal factor in
   declining richness values.
   5. Cattle utilized Grass and Flush vegetation to a significantly greater
   degree than Juncus vegetation, and this appeared to be related to forage
   availability rather than wetness as represented by water table depth.
   6. Cattle grazing is of potential value as a management tool for
   species-rich grasslands in upland forests provided that: areas to be
   grazed are large enough to minimize localized impacts and allow free
   ranging of the cattle, the economics and practicalities of stock
   husbandry are considered: the type of grazing management used is linked
   clearly to management objectives.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 3211 colonies of madrolichens, from twelve 50 m x 10 m plots
   distributed across four macrohabitat (vegetation) types between 1500
   m-3700 m in the Chopta-Tunganath landscape of the Garhwal Himalaya,
   yielded 13 families with 15 genera and 85 species. Lobaria retigera
   stood out as a broad-niched generalist species with moderate levels of
   abundance in all the three major microhabitats, viz. rock, soil and wood
   across 83\% of all the plots sampled, whereas Umbilicaria indica emerged
   as an abundantly occurring specialist confined to rock substrates.
   Heterodermia incana and Leptogium javanicum appeared to be rare members
   of the community as they were encountered only once during the field
   survey. Woody microhabitats turned out to be richer than rock and soil
   substrates for macrolichens. Amongst the macrohabitats, middle altitude
   (2500-2800 m) Quercus forest was richest in species and genera followed
   by high altitude (2900-3200 m) Rhododendron forest, higher altitude
   grasslands (3300-3700 m) and then the lower elevation (1500 m) Quercus
   forest. Species, genus and family level alpha- as well as
   beta-diversities were significantly correlated with each other, implying
   that higher taxonomic ranks such as genera may be used as surrogates for
   species thus facilitating cost- and time-effective periodic monitoring
   of the biodiversity of macrolichens. Dynamics of the diversity of lichen
   communities in relation to various forms of environmental disturbance
   including livestock grazing and tourism as dominant land use activities

   nitrogen fertiliser rates by 2 nitrogen types was applied in the first 3
   years, and half the plots received a single grazing in the 5th year.
   Effects were small but continued to develop after fertilisation ceased.
   While a single grazing initially depressed tussock height it
   subsequently enhanced height. There were changes in relative species
   abundance in response to fertiliser. Soil P and S levels increased with
   superphosphate fertiliser but decreased with N fertiliser, probably
   reflecting uptake by the increased shoot biomass and litter.}},

Abstract = {{The fragmentation of natural habitats is generally considered to be a
   major threat to biodiversity. We investigated short-term responses of
   vascular plants (grasses and forbs) and four groups of invertebrates
   (ants, butterflies, grasshoppers and gastropods) to experimental
   fragmentation of calcareous grassland in the north-western Jura
   mountains, Switzerland. Three years after the initiation of
   fragmentation - which was created and maintained by mowing the area
   between the fragments - we compared species richness, diversity and
   composition of the different groups and the abundance of single species
   in fragments of different size (area: 20.25 m(2), 2.25 m(2) and 0.35
   m(2)) with those in corresponding control plots. The abundances of 19
   (29\%) of the 65 common species examined were affected by fragmentation.
   However, the experimental fragmentation affected different taxonomic
   groups and single species to a different extent. Butterflies, the most
   mobile animals among the invertebrates studied, reacted most
   sensitively: species richness and foraging abundances of single
   butterfly species were lower in fragments than in control plots. Of the
   few other taxonomic groups or single species that were affected by the
   experimental fragmentation, most had a higher species richness or
   abundance in fragments than in control plots. This is probably because
   the type of fragmentation used is beneficial to some plants via
   decreased competition intensity along the fragment edges, and because
   some animals may use fragments as retreats between foraging bouts into
   the mown isolation area.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last 150 years, a large proportion of forests in Latin America
   have been converted to pastures. When these pastures are abandoned,
   grasses may slow reestablishment of woody species and limit forest
   regeneration. In this study, we explored the use of cattle in
   facilitating the establishment of woody vegetation in Colombian montane
   pastures, dominated by the African grasses Pennisetum clandestinum
   (Kikuyo) and Melinis minutiflora (Yaragua). First, we described woody
   and herbaceous vegetation in grazed and non-grazed pastures. Second, we
   tested the effect of grazing and seed addition on the establishment and
   growth of woody species. We also determined if the effect of grazing was
   different in P. clandestinum and M. minutiflora pastures. We found that
   low stocking density of cattle greatly increased density, number of
   branches per individual (a measure of ``shrubiness{''}), and basal area
   of woody species, but also reduced woody plant species richness and
   diversity. In the grazed area, the shrubs Baccharis latifolia (Chilca)
   and Salvia sp. (Salvia) were the most abundant. The combined effect of
   grazing and shading from the shrubs reduced herbaceous vegetation by 52
   to 92\%. In the grazing/seed addition experiment, grazing increased
   establishment of woody seedlings, particularly of the shrub Verbesina
   arborea (camargo), but the largest effect was seed addition. Where
   grasses are an important barrier to regeneration, grazing can facilitate
   the establishment of shrubs that create a microhabitat more suitable for
   the establishment of montane forest tree species.}},

   presents a competitive barrier against invading woody recruits, and also
   attracts cattle that may trample and/or consume recruits. Both logs and

Abstract = {{Invasion of natural ecosystems by weeds is often associated with
   increasing levels of disturbance. However, there is substantial evidence
   that cessation of disturbance can also lead to plant invasions,
   especially of woody species. In some coastal grasslands in south-eastern
   Australia, removal of grazing and burning appears to have triggered
   invasion by the indigenous shrub, Acacia sophorae. To quantify the
   impacts of such invasions on plant diversity, this study focussed on the
   coastal grasslands in Eurobodalla National Park, NSW. Analysis of aerial
   photographs indicated that 96 ha of the 479 ha study area (20\%) was
   invaded by Acacia between 1944 and 1994, with the most rapid expansion
   from the late 1970s when grazing was removed. Vegetation sampling
   demonstrated a strong negative correlation between Acacia cover and
   plant species richness. A linear regression between the species richness
   of each quadrat and the number of growth rings on the largest. Acacia
   branch showed an average loss of 7.5 species (38\% of species) after 10
   years of Acacia invasion and 15 species (76\%) after 20 years. Long-term
   invasion favoured just a small group of shade tolerant, rhizomic grasses
   and sedges. Without active ecosystem management, grassland plant
   diversity should continue to decline and the nationally threatened herb,
   Thesium australe, is likely to disappear. An adaptive management program
   should be implemented promptly to assess the effects of different
   management regimes on Acacia abundance and plant diversity at ENP. (C)

Abstract = {{Insectivorous birds have been shown to have direct effects on abundances
   of herbivorous arthropods, but few studies have tested the indirect
   effects of birds on plant performance through consumption of herbivorous
   insects. In a 3-year study at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New
   Hampshire, we tested whether bird predation indirectly affects leaf
   herbivory levels and leaf and shoot biomass production of understory
   sugar maple (Acer saccharum) saplings. Trees were randomly assigned to
   one of four treatments: an insecticide application to reduce herbivory
   levels, exclosures that prevented bird access, addition of Lepidoptera
   larvae, and controls. Trees sprayed with an insecticide supported
   significantly fewer Lepidoptera larvae than other treatments throughout
   the study. Also, trees in exclosures supported more Lepidoptera larvae
   than controls during one count each year, and pooled across all counts
   during the second year. As predicted, the mean proportion of leaf area
   consumed varied significantly among treatments and was least in the
   insecticide treatment, followed by controls, exclosures, and Lepidoptera
   additions. Significant differences among treatments in herbivory levels,
   however, did not lead to differences in leaf or shoot biomass
   production. Thus, bird predation decreased Lepidoptera abundances and
   decreased herbivory levels, but did not increase biomass production
   during the following year. Over 85\% of the herbivores in our study were
   Homoptera nymphs that were not folivorous and are not important bird
   prey items, potentially dampening the indirect effects of bird predation
   on biomass production. A comparison of these results with previous
   studies suggests that the indirect effects of bird predation on plant
   biomass production may depend on the plant species, abundance and
   composition of the herbivore community, and primary productivity of the
   ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Alternative silvicultural systems to clearcutting are receiving
   considerable attention in Pacific Northwest forests of North America.
   Understanding the implications of these harvesting systems on stand
   structure and biodiversity through time is a fundamental aspect of
   forest ecosystem management. This study was designed to test the
   hypothesis that diversity of stand-structure attributes and forest floor
   small-mammal communities will increase from young pine to seed tree to
   old-growth forest. The study area was within mixed Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii)-lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests within
   the Montane Spruce biogeoclimatic zone near Summerland in south-central
   British Columbia, Canada. This retrospective study had three replicate
   stands each of 17-yr-old ``young pine{''} (clear-cut harvested), ``seed
   tree{''} composed of young pine with Douglas-fir seed trees, and uncut
   ``old-growth{''} composed primarily of Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine.
   Stand-structure attributes (coniferous tree layers and understory
   vegetation) were measured in each stand. Small-mammal populations were
   sampled intensively from 1995 to 1997 in all stands.
   The mean total percentage cover and crown-volume index of herbs and
   mosses were similar among treatment stands, but for shrubs-deciduous
   trees were highest in young pine and lowest in old growth. Mean species
   richness of herbs and coniferous trees was similar among treatment
   stands, but for shrubs-deciduous trees was highest in the young pine.
   Mean species diversity of herbs and shrubs-deciduous trees was similar
   among treatment stands, but for coniferous trees was higher in the
   seed-tree and old-growth stands than in the young pine stands. Mean
   richness of layers of herbs and shrubs-deciduous trees appeared
   consistently highest in the young pine, but for coniferous trees was
   highest in the seed-tree stands. Mean abundance of red-backed voles
   (Clethrionomys gapperi) was consistently higher in the old-growth than
   in young pine or seed-tree stands. Mean numbers of Northwestern
   chipmunks (Tamias amoenus), heather voles (Phenacomys intermedius),
   western jumping mice (Zapus princeps), montane shrews (Sorex
   monticolus), and common shrews (S. cinereus) were higher in the
   seed-tree or young pine stands than in old growth. Mean abundance of
   meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) was highest in seed-tree stands.
   Deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), long-tailed voles (M. longicaudus),
   and short-tailed weasels (Mustela erminea) had similar mean numbers
   among treatment stands. Mean species richness and diversity of small
   mammals was higher in the seed-tree and young pine stands than in old
   growth. Each of these stand types offers its own structural diversity to
   the forest landscape and should help manage for a range of biodiversity
   goals.}},

Abstract = {{1. There is still considerable debate about the most effective methods
   of sampling invertebrates in monitoring and assessment programmes.
   2. The above-ground invertebrates of a limestone grassland in north-east
   England were compared between samples from pitfall traps and from a
   D-vac suction trap combined with a lightweight swish net (SW/DV).
   3. Over 14 000 individuals were captured, with similar numbers in the
   pitfall and SW/DV samples. A total of 480 species of Hemiptera,
   Coleoptera, Diptera and Araneae was identified and placed into 14 taxa
   for further analysis.
   4. The pitfall sample produced species/specimen curves from which it was
   possible to estimate species richness for all the Coleoptera and Araneae
   taxa and the calypterate Schizophora. The SW/DV sample was adequate to
   estimate the species richness of Hemiptera, most Diptera taxa,
   herbivorous Coleoptera and Linyphiidae.
   5. The proportion of Coleoptera and Araneae taxa that were method-unique
   was higher in the pitfall sample than the SW/DV sample and vice versa
   for the Hemiptera and Diptera taxa. Nevertheless, a relatively high
   proportion of method-unique species of most taxa was found in both
   sample types, indicating that they can each contribute to assessing
   species assemblages in grasslands.
   6. Both pitfall traps and SW/DV samples are needed to estimate species
   richness in grasslands for all taxa except Heteroptera, Homoptera and
   Lycosidae. Herbivorous Coleoptera and Linyphiidae were collected in
   numbers adequate for assessing richness in both sample types, but more
   specimens were required in one or other sample for the remaining taxa.}},

   Pennsylvania. Bird counts, nest monitoring, and vegetation sampling were
   conducted on 12 pairs (grazed and control) of streams in 1996 and 10

   Although nest density was higher and nest destruction rates by livestock

Abstract = {{This study explored consumption of a generalist herbivore feeding on
   leaf tissue of various plant species of a calcareous grassland, and
   tested whether consumption levels and preferences changed when plants
   were exposed to 5 years of in situ CO2 enrichment. The first part of
   this experiment tested whether the consumption patterns of slugs
   (Deraceras reticulatum) observed in single-species feeding tests were
   altered when slugs were given a choice of food sources. Overall
   consumption increased 270\% when slugs were given a choice, and they
   preferred having a choice of food sources more than they preferred
   having any one food source. Surprisingly, slugs consumed fewer legumes
   and grasses and more non-leguminous forbs when given a choice. In the
   second part of this experiment, feeding behaviors of slugs in response
   to elevated CO2 were investigated by feeding them leaves of two legumes,
   one grass, and a non-leguminous forb (Trifolium medium, Lotus
   corniculatus, Bromas erectus, and Sanguisorba minor, respectively) in
   two or four species combinations. Ln the leguminous species mix, the
   non-leguminous species mix, and the combined mix (legumes and
   non-legumes), neither overall consumption by herbivores nor species
   preference was significantly altered by long-term CO2 enrichment. In the
   combined species mix, slugs preferred legumes to non-legumes (P=0.012)
   and exhibited a weak functional group preference shift from non-legumes
   to legumes (P=0.089) in response to CO2 enrichment. This is the first
   time such a shift has been observed, and provides evidence that there
   may be multiple herbivore responses to rising atmospheric CO2
   concentrations. Numerous single-species feeding tests using insects have
   shown that consumption by herbivores may increase when herbivores are
   fed plants grown in enriched CO2 atmospheres. This study clearly
   demonstrates the limited applicability of non-choice feeding trials
   to,generalist herbivores in species-rich communities.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of plant diversity on abundance of invertebrate
   herbivores, parasitoids and predators in two grassland communities tone
   in Switzerland and one in Sweden) in which plant species richness and
   functional diversity have been experimentally manipulated. Among
   herbivores, the abundance of only the most sessile and specialised
   groups (leafhoppers and wingless aphids) was affected by plant
   diversity. At both sites, numbers of leafhoppsrs in sweep net samples
   showed a linear, negative relationship with plant species number whereas
   numbers of wingless aphids in suction samples increased with the number
   of plant functional groups (grasses, legumes, and non-legume forbs)
   present in the plot. Activity of carabid beetles and spiders las
   revealed by pitfall catches) and the total number of predators in
   pitfalls at the Swiss site decreased linearly with increases in the
   number of plant species and plant functional groups. Abundance of more
   specialised enemies, hymenopteran parasitoids, was not affected by the
   manipulations of plant diversity. Path analysis and analysis of
   covariance indicated that plant diversity effects on invertebrate
   abundance were mostly indirect and mediated by changes in plant biomass
   and cover. At both sites, plant species composition (i.e. the identity
   of plant species in a mixture) affected numbers of most of the examined
   groups of invertebrates and was, therefore, a more important determinant
   of invertebrate abundance in grasslands than plant species richness per
   se or the number of plant functional groups. The presence of legumes in
   a mixture was especially important and led to higher numbers of most
   invertebrate groups. The similarity of invertebrate responses to plant
   diversity at the two study sites indicates that general patterns in
   abundance of different trophic groups can be detected across plant
   diversity gradients under different environmental conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known on how management of Russian native grasslands affects
   botanical composition, soil and forage properties. Three fields were
   sampled in the V.V. Alekhin Central-Chernozem Biosphere State Reserve in
   the Kursk region of Russia: a native grassland (not cultivated for at
   least 300 years), a grazed/hay field with 4 years of annual harvest
   followed by 1 year of rest (periodically-cut grazed/hay field), and a
   yearly-cut grazed/hay field. Soil samples were collected from the top 10
   cm and analyzed. Plant species were identified at the sampling sites and
   this plant material was used to determine total elemental analysis of
   forage, crude protein (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid
   detergent fiber (ADF), in vitro true digestibility (IVTD) and lignin
   concentrations. Above-ground live and dead plant material and roots were
   analyzed for C, N and lignin. Soil sample analysis showed that fields
   were comparable in terms of soil chemical and physical properties. SOC
   and N contents were not statistically different in the native and yearly
   grazed/hay fields. Soil bulk density significantly increased as a result
   of utilization, from 0.80+/-0.09 Mg m(-3) for the native grassland to
   0.97+/-0.06 Mg m(-3) for the yearly grazed/hay field. A total of 107
   different plant species were recorded at the three fields. There were
   changes in plant composition among the fields. The native grassland
   field had the least number of plant species (41) followed by the
   yearly-cut grazed/hay field (68), and the periodically-cut grazed/hay
   field (87). There was a greater proportion of grass species (20\%) in
   the native grassland field. Dead plant biomass and roots from the
   grazed/hay fields were higher in N and Lignin concentrations. Forage
   mineral concentration was highest in the periodically-cut hay field. No
   significant differences were observed in terms of forage properties. (C)

Abstract = {{The development of botanical composition on pastures depends of much
   more influencing factors than on meadows. One of the main factors is
   predation, which is defined as heteronomous influence of grazing animals
   on pasture ecosystems. Additionally trampling, damage caused by browsing
   animals and distribution of excrements are important effects. Extensive
   and intensive pasture systems are characterized by the amount of
   nitrogen fertilisation, the utilisation frequency and the stocking rate.
   The consequences of the different systems on DM-contents, digestibility
   of organic matter and forage acceptance are described. Intensive grazing
   with high stocking rates prevents forage selection and even forage of
   lower quality and unliked plant materials is accepted. Extensive
   pastures are destinated by lower stocking rates and decreasing
   management efforts. But even on extensive pastures good feed conversion
   is possible if forage selection is existent. Examples are given for some
   factors influencing the forage acceptance and the effects of different
   stocking rates. Because of the spatial division of over- and undergrazed
   areas, additional effects of grazing is the increase of biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{This study estimates the relative contributions of environment and farm
   management strategies in influencing soil faunal assemblages and
   attempts tl, identify the species with potential to affect
   sustainability of intensive grazing management systems in the
   north-eastern USA. it arises because of the change from confinement
   feeding of daily cattle, consequent upon concerns about negative
   environmental effects, the rising costs for machinery and housing, and
   reduced profit margins, together with the absence of data from which the
   consequences of such change on thc soil fauna may be predicted.
   Macro-invertebrates we-re sampled in soil from seventy-eight grazed
   pastures on twenty-one dairy farms in Pennsylvania, USA, in the spring
   of 1994. On five of these farms, macro-invertebrates were sampled (four
   pastures per farm) in the spring, summer and autumn seasons of 1994,
   1995 and 1996. In 1997, macroinvertebrates were Sampled in sail during
   spring, summer and autumn from (four pastures per farm) on three farms
   in New York, and during spring and summer on three farms in Vermont.
   Species richness ranged from two to twelve species (mean 6.4) per
   pasture site in Pennsylvania and Ave to eighteen species (mean 10.7) in
   New York and Vermont. The communities were dominated at most sites by
   earthworms. Earthworms were correlated with soil basal and
   substrate-induced respiration/carbon ratio, and soil moisture, bur were
   negatively correlated with cows per hectare and herbage biomass in
   Pennsylvania. Sitona larvae were recorded at nineteen of the twenty-one
   farms during the spring of 1994 across Pennsylvania and occurred at
   populations >5 m(-2) in 68\% of the sampled pastures. Sitona larvae were
   less abundant in New York and Vermont. Elaterid larvae comprised a
   complex of seven species of which Aeolus melillus (Say) and Melanotus
   communis (Gyllenhal) comprised 35\% and 39\%, respectively, of the
   elaterids collected in Pennsylvania. Agriotes mancus (Say) and Ctenicera
   destructor (Brown) comprised 41\% and 26\%, respectively, of four
   species collected in New York and Vermont. Scarabaeid larvae, comprising
   a complex of fight species, were detected at only 27\% of the
   seventy-eight pastures sampled in spring 1994 in Pennsylvania. Five
   species were collected in ten of the twelve New York pastures and lour
   species in nine of the twelve Vermont pastures. Populations of
   scarabaeid larvae averaged <25 m(-2) in all three states, except in
   three Pennsylvania pastures in spring 1994. Detrended canonical
   correspondence analysis (DCCA) showed pasture standing biomass, legume
   diversity, pre-winter stubble height, white clover pasture content, and
   soil phosphorus levels influenced numbers of invertebrate species more
   than climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall, altitude, latitude
   and seasonal water table. DCCA also showed most pastures to be close to
   the average of environmental factors. The extremely low density of
   herbivorous macro-invertebrates in soil and the absence of pest
   outbreaks may indicate a stable soil ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{A: field experiment was designed to recreate a species-rich mesotrophic
   grassland community of conservation worth. Trifolium repens (white
   clover) was observed to increase significantly in both frequency and
   abundance in sown plots grazed by cattle, but not in plots cut in June
   and subsequently grazed by cattle. In both these treatments permanent
   quadrats containing clover patches were found to be lower in species
   richness than were quadrats without clover. In both treatments botanical
   diversity was seen to decline over time. In the grazed-only treatment
   the loss of diversity may be linked to the increase in clover. In the
   cut and grazed plots, T. repens did not become so abundant but:
   diversity was still seen to decline, possibly due to the:loss of low
   growing species from the taller sward. A pot experiment which varied the
   sowing density of a mix of seven wild flower species in full factorial
   combination with cutting frequency was established on soils from an
   arable field also sown with a single density of clover. T. repens was
   seen to decline from initial high cover estimates in infrequently cut
   and uncut treatments. In the pot experiment where a grass component to
   the vegetation was absent, clover was seen to have less impact on the
   other forbs than it did in the field. It is suggested that, being a
   nitrogen fixer, T. repens may have a competitive edge in ex-arable soils
   low in available nitrogen. The observed reduction in botanical diversity
   may be a result of this increase in available nitrogen, facilitating the
   spread of the sown grasses and preventing the recovery of the sown forbs
   that were excluded by the invasion of T. repens. It is suggested that
   reducing the proportion of grass in the seed mixtures during grassland
   habitat creation on these soils may help reduce or delay this effect.}},

Abstract = {{Linyphiid spiders are important generalist predators of insects in
   agricultural habitats. Their ability to rapidly disperse and colonise
   disturbed habitats makes them important as a natural form of pest
   control, often present before other predatory groups arrive. This paper
   examines the distribution of Erigone atra and E. dentipalpis, which are
   amongst the commonest linyphiid species to be found on agricultural land
   in Scotland, The habitat preferences of these species were assessed
   using abundance and proportion data from 71 independent sites sampled
   using pitfall traps over 2 years and a selection of repeat first-year
   sites sampled during the second year, incorporating a range of land-uses
   from extensive moorland, through grasslands to intensive arable fields.
   E. atra dominated in autumn sown crops, and E. dentipalpis dominated at
   the other end of the agricultural management spectrum in low-intensity
   grasslands. Both species were considered absent from upland and moorland
   habitats. Linear regression modelling was used to create a model which
   best estimated the variance in proportions of E. atra in the catch
   across the sites using a selection of vegetation, soil, management and
   landscape variables. This model was based on data from 58 sites where
   Erigone species were abundant and explained 66\% of the variation in E.
   atra. The variables included were increasing vegetation biomass above 50
   mm and increasing levels of mixed grazing (both positive), and a
   combination of increasing plant species richness and vegetation stem
   density (negative). The efficiency of the model was examined using data
   from 13 sites which were sampled in the subsequent year to assess the
   effects of no changes and changes in land-use on the proportions of the
   two species. Only two sites were considered inaccurate (more than 20\%
   different from the model), suggesting a relatively high level of
   accuracy. Interaction between the two species was tested for and not
   found to explain the differences in proportion observed. Comparisons
   with other studies were carried out, showing similar trends in
   proportions and in some of the variables identified as important. The
   influence of specific variables on each species is described in light of
   possible allometric-type effects, and the importance of these species
   for conservation and pest control in agriculture is discussed. (C) 2000

Abstract = {{The biodiversity of agroecosystems may be enhanced by increasing species
   richness and structural diversity of vegetation by creating perennial
   strips. Aims of the study were (1) to describe the plant succession of
   perennial strips in northern conditions; (2) to clarify the difference
   in insect fauna between cereal fields and perennial strips; (3) to
   determine the effect of succession on leafhoppers in perennial strips;
   and (4) to compare the leafhopper fauna of perennial strips with that of
   other uncultivated biotopes. Three perennial grass strips (12 m wide,
   420 m long) were sown in the middle of cereal fields (15 ha) in 1991
   with a seed mixture of timothy (Phleum pratense), meadow fescue (Festuca
   pratensis). red clover (Trifolium pratense) and white clover (Trifolium
   repens). The perennial strips were not mown or renewed after the
   establishment. In 1992 and 1993 barley and in 1993 spring wheat were
   grown in the surrounding fields.
   The composition of plant cover in the grass strips changed over four
   seasons. The total number of plant species decreased from 23 species in
   1992 to 10 in 1995. The change resulted from the dramatic decrease of
   annual weeds after the first year. Furthermore, the total plant cover
   declined slightly. The cover of P. pratense increased, whereas that of
   T. pratense and T. repens decreased. The plant species typical of early
   succession were annual weeds including Tripleurospermum inodorum and
   Thlaspi arvense. In the last year, perennial weeds such as Cirsium
   arvense and Elymus repens became common.
   Leafhopper abundance and species number were higher in perennial grass
   strips than in cereal fields. Furthermore, the species composition
   varied between habitats. Year-to-year fluctuations in leafhopper catches
   were large. Leafhopper abundance and diversity (Shannon index) were
   highest in 1993 when 192 sweep net samples contained a total 4680
   specimens belonging to 37 species. The plant species richness of the
   grass strips did not correlate with the abundance and species richness
   of leafhoppers, which seemed to be more dependent on other factors.
   Although the plant species number in grass strips decreased clearly
   during succession, changes in species richness of leafhoppers were not
   so great. Factors affecting the leafhopper community are discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{Mount Voras is covered by natural ecosystems comprising forests and

   1400 species. including many indigenous of the Balkan Peninsula. Very
   important also is the ornithological value of the mountain, which has
   been included in the European Union (EU) Network of Special Protection
   Areas. Although nature conservation and traditional land use are in a
   balance, recent studies have concluded that several parts of the
   mountain should be designated for protection and that conservation
   measures should be undertaken for others. This stemmed from the concern
   that degradation of the environment may occur, because there has been an
   attempt during the last decade to develop the area for multiple land
   use, especially tourism. Before designation, the main action has been
   the preparation of a three-ministerial resolution, which provides for

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{594-607}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1 Changes in the species composition of the soil seed bank were
   determined in a dry and a more species-rich wet chronosequence. Each
   sequence represented a 25-year hayfield succession following cessation
   of fertilizer application in the Drentse A Nature Reserve (NL). where
   the vegetation has been studied since 1972.
   2 The number of seeds of many late successional species showed a
   significant increase during succession with only two characteristic late
   species present in the seed bank of the early stage of each series. Most
   of the early successional species showed a decrease in the number of
   seeds, which paralleled their relative frequency within the vegetation.
   Overall, seed density and species diversity of the seed bank was higher
   in the wet than the dry chronosequence.
   3 Mean values for seed longevity were calculated for each successional
   phase in each series using a published seed bank data base, When based
   simply on the presence of species, the seed longevity index decreased
   significantly during the wet-series succession in both surface and
   deeper seed banks and in the vegetation. When based on the relative
   frequency of species present, the index decreased significantly in both
   series but only in the surface seed bank and the vegetation.
   4 Comparison with data for an ancient undisturbed wet hay meadow in
   England suggests that seed longevity of hayfield species is generally
   low. Similarity between seed bank and established vegetation was low in
   both the undisturbed British meadow (only 47\%) and in the relatively
   young Dutch study sites (c. 50\%).
   5 The soil seed bank is unlikely to determine hayfield succession in the
   Drentse A Nature Reserve, since the composition of the soil seed bank
   tended to follow that of the above-ground vegetation. Increases in plant
   species richness following the cessation of fertilizer application, the
   main goal of restoration management, therefore depend to a large extent
   on an influx of the seeds of most species from outside the site.}},

   Grazing changed species abundance and the vertical structure of the

   cessation of grazing. Although in general the most abundant species in

Abstract = {{Pasture lands are an important facet of land use in the northeast United
   States, yet little is known about their recent diversity. To answer some
   fundamental questions about the diversity of these pasture lands, we
   designed a broad survey to document plant species richness using an
   intensive, multi scale sampling method. We also wanted to learn whether
   environmental (soils or climate) or land management variables could help
   explain patterns of species richness. A total of 17 farms, encompassing
   37 pastures, were sampled in New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Maryland,
   Massachusetts and Connecticut during July and August 1998. We positively
   identified a total of 161 different plant species across the study
   region. Species richness averaged 31.7 +/-1.1 on pastures. Infrequent,
   transient species that were mostly perennial and annual forbs accounted
   for similar to 90\% of the species richness. Except for a subjective
   rating of grazing intensity, land management methods were not good
   predictors of species richness. Over time, it appears that grazing
   neither reduces nor increases species richness in pastures. Of the
   environmental variables measured, only soil P explained a significant
   amount of the variation in species richness. Soil P was inversely
   related to species richness at the 1m(2) scale. Percent SOM was
   positively associated with species richness at this scale, although
   weakly. At larger spatial scales, we suggest that patterns of species
   richness are best explained by the species diversity of soil seed banks,
   or seed rain, and stochastic recruitment of these species into existing
   vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{Progressive changes are observed in both the composition of mammal
   faunas and vegetation during the Miocene epoch {[}24-5 mega-annum (Ma)],
   These changes are usually interpreted as a response to climatic changes.
   In the traditional view, forests or woodlands gradually gave way to more
   open habitats, with grazing (grass-eating) ungulate (hoofed) mammal
   species replacing the browsing (leafy-vegetation-eating) species as
   grasslands expanded. However, data from fossil assemblages in the Great
   Plains region of North America show that this faunal change was not a
   one-for-one replacement of browsers by grazers, as usually thought.
   Typical late early Miocene (17 Ma) fossil communities included
   extraordinarily high numbers of browsing ungulate species, comprising a
   fauna that cannot be directly analogized with any present-day community.
   Both maximum species richness of all ungulates and the proportion of
   browsers declined steadily in ungulate communities through the middle
   Miocene, to levels comparable to those of the present by the late
   Miocene. The resulting dramatic, cumulative loss of browsing species
   constitutes one of the strongest faunal signals of the late Tertiary
   (but was not a single ``event{''}). We suggest that the early Miocene
   browser-rich communities may reflect higher levels of primary
   productivity in Miocene vegetation, compared with equivalent present-day
   vegetation types. The observed decline in species richness may represent
   a gradual decline in primary productivity, which would be consistent
   with one current hypothesis of a mid-Miocene decrease in atmospheric CO2
   concentrations from higher mid-Cenozoic values.}},

Abstract = {{The preservation of the floristic diversity of natural ecosystems and
   the maintenance of extensive livestock grazing are two of the major
   priorities of European Union agricultural and environmental policies.
   Temperate natural and seminatural grasslands are among the most
   threatened ecosystems in Europe. In order to establish the most
   appropriate management practices that prevent degradation and maintain
   the richness of these ecosystems, detailed analyses of the mechanisms
   that regulate biodiversity of the communities are particularly
   necessary. In this study we make a comparative analysis of the species
   richness and the diversity of the main rangeland communities in a
   widespread, heterogeneous area located in the Western Spanish Pyrennees.
   The nature and the contribution of perennials and annuals to the
   diversity patterns encountered are studied and related to the mechanisms
   suggested to regulate diversity in each case. Higher diversity values
   were reported in more environmentally stressed, xeric and moist
   communities. High spatial and temporal heterogeneity and low rates of
   competitive displacement related to the scarcity of basic resources are
   among the factors suggested to regulate the diversity of these
   communities. In areas where environmental factors are more favorable,
   such as perennial-dominated mesic rangelands, the enhancement of the
   diversity seemed more dependent on biotic disturbances, such as
   herbivory, that decreased the cover of perennials and favored the
   recruitment of short-lived species. Dispersal processes related to
   traditional nomadic grazing allow a flow of species from one rangeland
   to another but also enhance the establishment of species coming from
   lowland habitats. Most of the annuals enhancing the diversity of the
   mesic community were ruderals. The consideration of ruderals as exotics

Abstract = {{Degradation of land in vulnerable areas can be significantly reduced by
   the maintenance or establishment of plant cover and diversity. Animals
   can facilitate plant diversity by grazing, by dispersing seeds or by
   contributing, through excreta, to the heterogeneous distribution of
   nutrients in soil. We investigated the latter property by examining the
   effects of rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus L.) dung deposition on soil
   properties in three adjacent plant communities at a semi-arid site in
   south-east Spain. Rabbit: faecal pellets had concentrations of total N
   and P comparable to dung of stock animals, with K and Mg somewhat lower,
   although decomposition rates at this site are evidently very low. There
   was no significant difference in pH, but conductivity and concentrations
   of organic C, N (as NH4+ and NO3-), K, P and Mg in soils from rabbit
   latrines were significantly greater relative to controls in each
   community. Barley plants grown as a bioassay of soil fertility had
   significantly greater total biomass, and lower root:shoot ratios in
   latrine compared to control soils. There were differences among
   communities in conductivity and concentrations of N, P and organic C
   under latrines which were reflected in the bioassay. Although latrines
   only comprised approximately 0.1\% of the ground surface area in each
   community, they make significant localised contributions to soil
   fertility and may therefore be important in establishing and maintaining
   plant cover.}},

Abstract = {{Just as long-term nitrogen loading of grasslands decreases plant species
   richness and increases plant biomass, we have found that nitrogen
   loading decreases insect species richness and increases insect
   abundances. We sampled 54 plots that had been maintained at various
   rates of nitrogen addition for 14 years. Total insect species richness
   and effective insect diversity, as well as herbivore and predator
   species richness, were significantly, negatively related to the rate of
   nitrogen addition. However, there was variation in trophic responses to
   nitrogen. Detritivore species richness increased as nitrogen addition
   increased, and parasitoids showed no response. Insect abundances,
   measured as the number of insects and insect biovolume (an estimate of
   biomass), were significantly, positively related to the rate of nitrogen
   addition, as were the abundances of herbivores and detritivores.
   Parasitoid abundance was negatively related to the rate of nitrogen
   addition. Changes in the insect community were correlated with changes
   in the plant community. As rates of nitrogen addition increased, plant
   species richness decreased, plant productivity and plant tissue nitrogen
   increased, and plant composition shifted from C-4 to C-3 grass species.
   Along this gradient, total insect species richness and effective insect
   diversity were most strongly, positively correlated with plant species
   richness. Insect biovolume was negatively correlated with plant species
   richness. Responses of individual herbivores varied along the nitrogen
   gradient, but numbers of 13 of the 18 most abundant herbivores were
   positively correlated with their host plant biomass. Although insect
   communities did not respond as strongly as plant communities, insect
   species richness, abundance, and composition were impacted by nitrogen
   addition. This study demonstrates that long-term nitrogen loading
   affects the entire food chain, simplifying both plant and insect
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Succession is one of the most studied processes in ecology and
   succession theory provides strong predictability. However, few attempts
   have been made to influence the course of succession thereby testing the
   hypothesis that passing through one stage is essential before entering
   the next one. At each stage of succession ecosystem processes may be
   affected by the diversity of species present, but there is little
   empirical evidence showing that plant species diversity may affect
   succession. On ex-arable land, a major constraint of vegetation
   succession is the dominance of perennial early-successional (arable
   weed) species. Our aim was to change the initial vegetation succession
   by the direct sowing of later-successional plant species. The hypothesis
   was tested that a diverse plant species mixture would be more successful
   in weed suppression than species-poor mixtures. In order to provide a
   robust test including a wide range of environmental conditions and plant
   species, experiments were carried out at five sites across Europe. At
   each site, an identical experiment was set up, albeit that the plant
   species composition of the sown mixtures differed from site to site.
   Results of the 2-year study showed that diverse plant species mixtures
   were more effective at reducing the number of natural colonisers (mainly
   weeds from the seed bank) than the average low-diversity treatment.
   However, the effect of the low-diversity treatment depended on the
   composition of the species mixture. Thus, the effect of enhanced species
   diversity strongly depended on the species composition of the
   low-diversity treatments used for comparison. The effects of
   high-diversity plant species mixtures on weed suppression differed
   between sites. Low-productivity sites gave the weakest response to the
   diversity treatments. These differences among sites did not change the
   general pattern. The present results have implications for understanding
   biological invasions. It has been hypothesised that alien species are
   more likely to invade species-poor communities than communities with
   high diversity. However, our results show that the identity of the local
   species matters. This may explain, at least partly, controversial
   results of studies on the relation between local diversity and the
   probability of being invaded by aliens.}},

   markedly different from that of domestic cattle, it is particularly
   important to evaluate response of ecosystem elements near water sources
   to horse use. To assess this response, we performed live-trapping; of
   small mammals and 2-tiered vegetative sampling in 2 mountain ranges in
   central Nevada in the interior Great Basin. USA. At low elevations,
   plots around horse-excluded springs exhibited notably greater plant
   species richness. percent cover, and abundance of grasses and shrubs. as
   well as more small mammal burrow entrances than plots at horse-grazed
   springs. At high elevations. meadows protected from grazing exhibited
   maximum vegetation heights 2.8 times greater than vegetation grazed by
   horses only and 4.5 times greater than vegetation grazed by horses and
   cattle. Species richness in quadrats was most different between the
   horse and-cattle-grazed meadow and its ungrazed counterpart suggesting
   the possibility of synergistic effects of horse and cattle grazing in
   the same location. This study, the first in the Great Basin to
   investigate quantitatively ecosystem consequences of feral horse use

Abstract = {{The species composition of grazing lands can be influenced by livestock
   and grazing pressure. A study on manure seed bank was conducted in
   Ghinchi highland Research Site in Ethiopia between 1995 and 1997. The
   data on species composition and life-form of the plants germinating in
   pots receiving air dried manure were compared with species composition
   of experimental plots in natural grassland subjected to varying grazing
   intensity. There was significant difference among the species
   composition of grazed and non-grazed grasslands and the manure seed bank
   (p = 0.01). The life-forms of the species also showed variation. There
   were more families and species in the natural grassland vegetation than
   indicated in the manure seed bank. The manure seed bank had more annuals
   than the natural grassland vegetation. The species composition and
   life-forms in the manure seed bank showed variation with time and this
   corresponded with the seasonal Variation in the grassland, which had a
   direct relationship with the rainfall pattern. The study showed that
   livestock play a major role in maintaining the biodiversity of grassland
   vegetation by spatial and temporal dispersion of readily germinating
   seeds in their manure. The use of manure to improve soil fertility
   should be weighed cautiously against the introduction of weeds into crop
   fields, although weeds are important feed resource for livestock in
   land-constrained areas. There is therefore the need for developing
   manure management practices so that the benefits can be optimised and
   the undesirable effects can be minimised. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Abstract = {{We examined the dynamics of cryptogamic soil crusts in a derived
   (disclimax) grassland near Orange in south-eastern Australia. Changes in
   the cover of cryptogamic crusts and floristics and abundance of the
   constituent species were measured on four treatments with two levels
   each of grazing and cultivation. Twenty-two lichens, mosses and
   livenworts were found at the study site and, of these, 13 were collected
   in the quadrats. Three moss species (Barbula calycina, Eccremidium
   arcuatum and Bryum pachytheca) and one lichen species (Cladonia
   tessalata) accounted for 67\% of total cover-abundance scores.
   Generally, cover-abundance was significantly higher in the unvegetated
   microsites than in the vegetated microsites. Species richness was not
   significantly different between the four grazing-cultivation treatments
   but, on average, there were significantly more species in the
   unvegetated microsites (mean = 3.2 species) than in the vegetated
   microsites (0.54 species). Grazing and cultivation resulted in
   significantly greater cover of bare ground and consequently
   significantly greater crust cover. Averaged across all treatments,
   approximately half of the area of unvegetated soil was occupied by
   cryptogams. Overall, the results indicate that lichens and bryophytes
   are important components of derived temperate grasslands, surviving in
   even densely vegetated swards. This study suggests that strategics which
   disturb the soil surface (e.g. grazing and cultivation) will stimulate
   the abundance and cover of soil crust organisms by increasing the
   availability of unvegetated microsites.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing (without modern fertilizers), mowing, and other

   suppressed by humans. There is indirect evidence that livestock grazing
   and mowing have made possible the continued existence of many species
   threatened by the human overkill of megaherbivores and other large
   herbivores. Many species that were dependent on natural fires and floods
   may have benefited from grazing and mowing, which also may be effective
   tools for mitigating the negative effects of eutrophications. As partial
   surrogates, traditional grazing and mowing have obscured the importance
   of natural disturbances to European biodiversity. Thus, the end of
   traditional animal husbandry, together with the suppression of natural

Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{746-757}},

Abstract = {{Because of changes in land use, the quantity of extensively grazed or
   mown calcareous grasslands and their successional stages have
   drastically declined over the last few decades in Central Europe. Old
   fallow land has decrease most. It is often afforested or converted into
   extensively cultivated grassland because extensive cultivation is
   believed to be favorable for diversity and rare species conservation.
   The relative importance of fallow calcareous grasslands, however, has
   not been investigated fully and might be much underestimated. To
   evaluate the relative importance of extensively grazed pastures, early
   and old fallow land, and young forest, we examined populations of
   diurnal butterflies from 14 sites in the Swiss Jura Mountains. We used
   univariate, multivariate, and qualitative methods to compare the
   successional stages. The first 2-3 years of succession had little
   influence on the butterfly fauna. Therefore, pastures and early fallow
   land were treated as a single ``early stage.{''} Old fallow land had
   significantly higher species richness (+32\%) and heterogeneity (+65\%)
   and hosted more Red List species (+48\%) than the early stage. Young
   forest was depauperate in butterfly species. Further, cluster analysis
   and correspondence analysis showed a close resemblance of the sites of
   the early stage to each other and a clear difference from the sites of
   old fallow land. All differences were best explained by the successional
   age of the sites. Both early stage and old fallow land showed a high
   proportion (>25\%) of stage-specific species, but more threatened
   species were specific to old fallow land. We conclude that up to now the
   importance of old fallow land has been underestimated in conservation
   efforts in Central Europe. Contrary to the prevailing opinion, it is at
   least as important for butterflies as extensively cultivated grassland.
   Further conversion into forest, a common habitat in the region, should
   be prevented. Because old fallow land has become exceedingly rare, its
   inclusion in management plans is urgently needed. Otherwise, we may soon
   lose a valuable but often overlooked part of our biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Seed predation by rodents had major direct and indirect impacts on
   experimental plantings of 16 species of herbaceous dicots of the
   prairie/savanna interface in southwestern Wisconsin. We broadcast seeds
   in the autumn of 1997 on 18 2 X 2 m plots surrounded by rodent-proof
   fencing. Experimental treatments included: (I) continuous rodent
   exclusion, (2) rodent access from December to April, and (3) rodent
   access from May to November. Highly selective seed predation by meadow
   voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) during the winter directly reduced
   densities of the aggressive, large-seeded composite Silphium
   integrifolium by 59\%. Indirectly, this suppression of Silphium resulted
   in 24-132\% compensatory increases in the abundance of small-seeded
   species not eaten by voles, and a 33\% increase in diversity of plant
   species as estimated by Simpson's D. Vole herbivory and granivory during
   the spring and summer had no influence on overall plant abundance or

   suppression of Silphium integrifolium and the compensatory response of
   small-seeded composites and legumes not eaten by voles may foretell a

Abstract = {{Dairy cattle grazing has become popular to dairy farmers in the
   Northeast looking for management schemes to cut production costs.
   Carabidae (ground beetles) and Staphylinidae (rove beetles) are
   indicators of habitat disturbances, such as drainage of wetlands, or
   grassland for grazing animals, and their monitoring could provide one
   measure of ecosystem sustainability if intensive grazing management
   systems expand or intensify in the future. Our objective was to assess
   the abundance and species richness of these two beetle families under
   intensive grazing throughout Pennsylvania, southern New York and
   Vermont. We collected 4365 ground beetles (83 species) and 4,027 rove
   beetles (79 species) by pitfall traps in three years in Pennsylvania.
   Nine ground beetle species, Amara aenea, Poecilus chalcites,
   Pterostichus melanarius, Bembidion quadrimaculatum oppositum, Amara
   familiaris, Poecilus lucublandus, Agonum muelleri, Bembidion obtusum and
   Bembidion mimus represented 80\% of the Carabidae collected.
   Five other species were new to Pennsylvania. Four rove beetle species,
   Philonthus cognatus, Meronera. venustula, Amischa analis, and Philonthus
   various = (carbonarius), comprised 74\% of the total Staphylinidae
   collected. Yearly distributions of the dominant species did not change
   significantly in the three years with A. aenea and P cognatus being most
   abundant every year. A parasitic rove beetle, Aleochara tristis, was
   recovered for the first time in Pennsylvania and Vermont since its
   release in the 1960's to control face fly, Musca autumnalis.
   Similar results were found in New York and Vermont. We collected 1,984
   ground beetles (68 species). Pterostichus melanarius was most abundant.
   Pterostichus vernalis was detected for the first time in the United
   States (Vermont). It was previously reported from Montreal, Canada. We
   collected 843 rove beetles (45 species). Philonthus cognatus was the
   most abundant rove beetle. In addition, Tachinus corticinus, previously
   known only from Canada, was discovered for the first time in the United
   States in Vermont.
   Pastures in Pennsylvania were diverse, containing 14 species of forage
   plants and 17 weed species. Botanical composition was similar in New
   York and Vermont. Sixteen species of grasses and legumes made up 90\% of
   the plant composition and 36 species of weeds made up the remainder.
   This diverse plant ecosystem may explain the richness of ground and rove
   beetles in northeastern U.S. pastures because the heterogeneity in the
   plant population provided additional resources which can support a rich
   assemblage of beetles. Monitoring richness and abundance of Carabidae
   and Staphylinidae over three years in Pennsylvania suggests intensive
   grazing systems are ecologically sustainable.}},

Title = {{Effects of grazing by free-ranging cattle on vegetation dynamics in a
   continental north-west European heathland}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{415-431}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Abandonment and eutrophication are major threats to traditional
   pastoral landscapes and their wildlife in Europe. Social and economical
   developments have rendered traditional pastoralism impracticable. More
   knowledge is needed about the effects of grazing with free-ranging
   herbivores, which is increasingly used as a substitute for the
   traditional herding system.
   2. We studied the effects of free-ranging cattle on the recovery of
   Calluna heather, tree encroachment and plant species richness in six
   habitats in a grass-rich Dutch heathland during a 10-year period. The
   habitats differed in soil fertility, initial heather-grass ratio and
   developmental stage of Calluna.
   3. Despite preferential grass defoliation, cattle grazing neither
   reduced grass cover in grass heath nor prevented grass invasion in
   heather. Grass invasion failed only in a nitrogen-poor turf-stripped
   Calluna heath. Grazing induced a substantial Calluna recovery in grass
   heaths on podzolic soils, but its recovery failed in grass heath on a
   phosphorus-rich medieval arable field. As a consequence, the
   grass-heather mosaics generated by free-ranging cattle were restricted
   to habitats of intermediate soil fertility.
   4. Grazing did not prevent encroachment by pine and birch. Removal by
   the site manager prevented conversion of 10-20\% of the open heathland
   to forest.
   5. During the first 5 years, grazing induced a significant increase in
   species richness in all habitats. During the second 5 years, species
   richness stabilized in grass heath and heather-grass mosaics and it
   declined in the pioneer Calluna heaths.
   6. We found indications of various nutrient-mediated grazing effects on
   the competitive balance between grass and woody pioneers. These suggest
   that nutrient-mediated feedback might be an important explanatory
   mechanism for the described vegetation mosaic cycling in heathlands.
   7. Free-ranging grazing did not remove the high atmospheric nutrient
   inputs of the whole area. Substantial amounts of nutrients were
   redistributed from the grass lawns to the forest.
   8. Free-ranging grazing combined with tree cutting appeared to be a
   suitable management regime for the maintenance of species-rich open
   heathlands with dynamic grass-heather mosaics.
   9. Without tree cutting, free-ranging grazing would have created dynamic
   tree-grass-heather mosaics in open heathland. Wood-pasture landscapes
   are fundamentally different from the open heather-dominated heathlands
   produced by the traditional sedentary farming system. Integrated grazing
   of heathland, nutrient-rich farmland and forests accelerates this
   change. Alternative grazing regimes are discussed.}},

Title = {{Restoration of alvar vegetation on Oland, Sweden}},
Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{65-72}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{. Alvars in the Baltic region, particularly on the Swedish islands of
   Oland and Gotland and in western Estonia, are well-known for their plant
   species richness and extensive populations of rare species. Grasslands
   make up most of alvar vegetation. The extent of these grasslands
   decreases because of bush enchroachment which takes place in most alvars
   when traditional land use practice changes, notably when grazing is
   ceased. The main threat for the alvar grassland is formed by the rapid
   expansion of Juniperus communis and Potentilla fruticosa in dry and wet
   sites, respectively. Applied research has been carried out during
   several years in order to develop plans for the restoration of alvar
   grassland. Thus it was shown that species richness in areas with a
   mixture of grassland and shrubland decreases in relation to the
   increased cover by shrubs. In the case of Juniperus there is a distinct
   drop in species number as soon as the cover exceeds 75-80\%, while the
   decrease is more gradual with increased cover of Potentilla. The seed
   banks under dense stands of these shrubs only contain ca. 20\% of the
   species found in dry and wet alvar meadows. This was confirmed by
   clearing experiments. Long-term recordings have shown that establishment
   of juniper seedlings takes place mainly in half-open areas between
   already existing junipers. Intermediate-sized junipers expanded faster
   than old and big shrubs. Potentilla shrubs recover fast from cutting or
   burning. After 2-4 yr they have almost attained their former size. This
   recovery can be prevented when cattle grazing is introduced. In the
   framework of a local alvar restoration project on Oland, covering 7000
   ha, grazing regimes are re-established, fences erected and large-scale
   clearings carried out. Recently established juniper shrubs are being
   cleared, intermediate sized junipers (30-50 yr old) are selectively
   removed while creating a mosaic landscape with high biological
   diversity. Older dense juniper stands are left alone or are only partly
   cleared. Potentilla stands in moist areas are cut to create moist
   meadows which are breeding grounds for waders, and to establish
   corridors between remaining open areas. Three items are discussed (1)
   the importance of the Stora Alvar area; (2) re-introduction of grazing
   and (3) re-introduction of species. The outstanding importance of the
   area regarding species richness and endemism should be recognized
   through a golden list to be used along with red and blue lists.}},

Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{243-253}},

Abstract = {{Characteristics used to categorize plant species into functional groups
   for their effects on ecosystem functioning may also be relevant to
   higher trophic levels. In addition, plant and consumer diversity should
   be positively related because more diverse plant communities offer a
   greater variety of resources for the consumers. Thus, the Functional
   group composition and richness of a plant community may affect the
   composition and diversity of the herbivores and even higher trophic
   levels associated with that community. We tested this hypothesis by
   sampling arthropods with a Vacuum sampler (34531 individuals of 494
   species) from an experiment in which we manipulated plant Functional
   group richness and composition. Plant manipulations included all
   combinations of three functional groups (forbs, C-3 graminoids, and C-4
   graminoids) removed zero, one, or two at a time from grassland plots at
   Cedar Creek Natural History Area. MN. Although total arthropod species
   richness was unrelated to plant Functional group richness or
   composition, the species richness of some arthropod orders was affected
   by plant Functional group composition.
   Two plant characteristics explained most of the effects of plant
   functional groups on arthropod species richness. Nutritional quality, a
   characteristic related to ecosystem Functioning, and taxonomic
   diversity, a characteristic not used to designate plant Functional
   groups, seemed to affect arthropod species richness both directly and
   indirectly. Thus, plant functional groups designated For their effects

   diversity and abundance.}},

   manipulations of stocking rates (moderate, heavy and very heavy) and
   grazing regimes (continuous vs. seasonal), in a factorial design.
   3. The herbaceous community was rich in species, with 166 species
   recorded at the site, of which 74\% were annuals. Plant cover was
   dominated by 10 species that accounted for 75\% of the total cover.
   4. Inter-seasonal rainfall variation was a dominant factor in the
   expression of different grazing treatments on the structure of the plant
   community. Grazing effects were stronger in wet years than in dry years.
   5. Paddocks under continuous grazing were higher in number of species
   compared with paddocks subjected to seasonal grazing, independently of
   grazing intensity.
   6. Functional group analyses showed that reduction in cover of tall
   grasses was correlated with an increase in cover of prostrate annual
   legumes and less palatable groups such as annual and perennial thistles,
   crucifers and forbs.
   7. Cover of functional groups composed of hemicryptophytic species was
   less variable (lower coefficient of variation) in response to grazing
   treatments and inter-annual variation in climatic conditions compared
   with functional groups with annual species.
   8. The persistence of the dominant species and the relatively small
   amplitude of change in plant cover of the functional groups suggest that
   the community was rather stable in spite of wide variation in grazing
   regimes and climatic conditions. East-Mediterranean grasslands appear to
   be adapted to grazing due to their long history of human association.}},

Abstract = {{While there has been a rapidly increasing research effort focused on
   understanding whether and how composition and richness of species and
   functional groups may determine ecosystem properties, much remains
   unknown about how these community attributes affect the dynamic
   properties of ecosystems. We conducted an experiment in 540
   mini-ecosystems in glasshouse conditions, using an experimental design
   previously shown to be appropriate for testing for functional group
   richness and composition effects in ecosystems. Artificial communities
   representing 12 different above-ground community structures were
   assembled. These included treatments consisting of monoculture and two-
   and four-species mixtures from a pool of four plant species; each plant
   species represented a different functional group. Additional treatments
   included two herbivore species, either singly or in mixture, and with or
   without top predators. These experimental units were then either
   subjected to an experimentally imposed disturbance (drought) for 40 d or
   left undisturbed. Community composition and drought both had important
   effects on plant productivity and biomass, and on several below-ground
   chemical and biological properties, including those linked to the
   functioning of the decomposer subsystem. Many of these compositional
   effects were due to effects both of plant and of herbivore species.
   Plant functional group richness also exerted positive effects on plant
   biomass and productivity, but not on any of the below-ground properties.
   Above-ground composition also had important effects on the response of
   below-ground properties to drought and thus influenced ecosystem
   stability (resistance); effects of composition on drought resistance of
   above-ground plant response variables and soil chemical properties were
   weaker and less consistent. Despite the positive effects of plant
   functional group richness on some ecosystem properties, there was no
   effect of richness on the resistance of any of the ecosystem properties
   we considered. Although herbivores had detectable effects on the
   resistance of some ecosystem properties, there were no effects of the
   mixed herbivore species treatment on resistance relative to the single
   species herbivore treatments. Increasing above-ground food chain length
   from zero to three trophic levels did not have any consistent effect on
   the stability of ecosystem properties. There was no evidence of either
   above-ground composition or functional group richness affecting the
   recovery rate of ecosystem properties from drought and hence ecosystem
   resilience. Our data collectively point to the role of composition
   (identity of functional group), but not functional group richness, in
   determining the stability (resistance to disturbance) of ecosystem
   properties, and indicates that the nature of the above-ground community
   can be an important determinant of the consistency of delivery of
   ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation records from 1963-66 and 1990 were compared in eight
   semi-permanent plots from continuously managed, semi-natural hay-meadows
   from five sites in southern Sweden to find out whether changes in plant
   communities could be detected in these grasslands over a period of ca.
   25 years in spite of unchanged management. It was found that species
   richness, ct-diversity and species frequency distribution remained
   fairly constant over the period, while there was considerable species
   turnover. However, it was also found that the total cover of vascular
   plants increased as well as the proportion of graminoids, both in cover
   and in species number, with a corresponding decrease of forbs. The
   number of species favoured by mowing also decreased as well as the
   number of typical grassland species. The detected changes are
   interpreted partly as effects of increased loads of atmospheric nitrogen
   deposition, and partly related to small changes in management intensity
   (changed frequency of mowing and/or aftermath grazing). It is possible
   that the significant land use changes in adjacent areas resulting in
   large landscape changes (increase of forests and woodlands) might have
   negatively influenced the interchange of grassland species, leading to
   an increase in the number of non-typical grassland species in the
   meadows. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands in alluvial systems are studied in 12 valleys and
   intermontane basins in south-eastern New Zealand. Vegetation patterns
   and their environmental determinants are described overall, and in five
   different valley groups ({''}clusters{''}). Data from grazing-exclosures
   are used to examine effects of the cessation of grazing on vegetation,
   and long-term plots and management-induced contrasts at fencelines are
   used to examine grazing effects. Climate (minimum temperature of the
   coldest month and rainfall) and landscape position are the determinants
   of the primary vegetation gradient. A secondary vegetation gradient
   represents vegetation modification (i.e., the degree of exotic species
   dominance) in alluvial systems. Exclosures indicate post-pastoral
   decreases in exotic species dominance, in terms of abundance, in two
   alluvial sites, and increased exotic dominance in three alluvial sites.
   In terms of species numbers, a decrease in exotic proportion is
   indicated at one site, and an increase is indicated at four sites.
   Differences between the exclosed and continually grazed vegetation in
   native species richness, and in the amount and proportion of native
   biomass, are negatively related to the biomass of exotic species present
   in the ungrazed vegetation, and are not related to the environmental
   characteristics of the sites. Historic data are insufficient to identify
   general trends in grazed alluvial grasslands. In three sites for which
   data are available, the dominance of exotic species had increased, and
   the proportional contributions of all native species, and of native
   grasses, had decreased with time. In terms of species number, however,
   proportions of native species had increased at two sites, and decreased
   at one site. Widespread and well established exotic grasses appear to
   have reached their potential environmental range in the alluvial systems
   studied, but the more recent invader, Hieracium pilosella, may not yet
   occupy its potential range. The practicability of post-pastoral
   conservation of native vegetation in alluvial systems might be indicated
   by the identification of modification thresholds. However, threshold
   identification requires data from a greater number of long-term plots
   than presently exists in southern alluvial grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{I studied competition and coexistence of three tall clonal perennial
   plant species, Calamagrostis epigejos (L.) Roth, Solidago canadensis L.,
   and Tanacetum vulgare L. along a gradient of soil productivity over five
   years. A replacement series field experiment was conducted with high,
   moderate and low fertility levels in 1mx1m plots. There were significant
   effects of soil type on ramet density (P < 0.001), mean height (P <
   0.01), and total biomass (P < 0.01). Ramet density, mean height, and
   total biomass increased with increasing soil fertility. There were also
   significant effects of mixture on ramet density (P < 0.01), but not on
   mean height and total biomass for all species. Significant neighbor
   effects on ramet density and total biomass (P < 0.01) were found for
   Solidago, showing that it is important whether Tanacetum or
   Calamagrostis is its neighbor within mixtures. During the five years
   there was only one case of competitive exclusion: Calamagrostis excluded
   Solidago on the most fertile substrate in the fifth growing season. In
   most cases species coexisted over the five years. Each of the three
   species was able to dominate in at least one combination of substrate
   type and mixture. The experiment showed that asymmetric competition for
   light on substrates of high fertility, symmetric competition for
   nutrients on nutrient-poor soil and positive interactions especially on
   substrates of intermediate fertility played a role. A founder effect was
   evident in aggregated mixtures of Calamagrostis and Solidago on the
   nutrient-rich substrate. A conceptual model of the relative importance
   of root competition for soil nutrients, shoot competition for light, and
   positive interactions along the fertility gradient is presented. The
   model emphasizes that positive interactions play an important role over
   a broad range of the productivity scale with a peak at intermediate
   levels of fertility. On the substrate of high productivity shoot
   competition for light is more important than positive interactions and
   root competition for soil nutrients as well. The competitive superiority
   of Calamagrostis on the most productive substrate was evident only in
   the long run. Rare events like extreme summer drought or selective
   herbivore pressure caused a switch in dominance in mixtures with
   Solidago, respectively Tanacetum. The guerrilla growth strategy of
   Calamagrostis and interference competition through a dense cover of
   aboveground biomass and litter could further cause competitive
   exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation changes in a semi-natural grassland of wooded meadow type
   that had been grazed for centuries are described following the
   introduction of various management regimes: mowing each year, mowing
   every third year, bunting, mechanical removal of woody plants, chemical
   treatment of woody plants, continuous gazing and abandonment. The
   experiment was established in southern Sweden in 1972 and has been in
   progress for 15 years. In 1972, 1980 and 1986 the botanical composition
   in these plots was investigated in permanent subplots. The study clearly
   demonstrates that mowing or grazing is necessary to preserve community
   structure and that mowing is to be preferred in cases where maintaining
   species richness is of primary concern. Mowing every third year delayed
   Vegetation change and prevented woody species from spreading. Therefore,
   periodic mowing might be an alternative way to preserve the flora. In
   contrast, yearly burning does not seem to be a viable management in this
   type of semi-natural grassland. To preserve the open landscape
   regeneration of woody plants has to be prevented. However, in plots
   where woody plants were removed the typical grassland flora declined.
   Abandonment resulted in closed forest.}},
