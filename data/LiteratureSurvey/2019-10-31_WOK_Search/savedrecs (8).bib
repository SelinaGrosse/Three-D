Abstract = {{The study of vegetation dynamics in tallgrass prairie in response to
   fire has focused on dormant season fire in late successional prairies.
   Our objective was to determine if late season fire of varying frequency
   results in divergent successional patterns in an early successional
   tallgrass prairie disturbed by grazing and cultivation. Specifically, we
   evaluated the influence of late-summer fires of varying frequency on
   community composition and species richness. We collected vegetation and
   environmental data on two sites burned in the late growing-season at
   varying frequencies. These communities differed in composition depending
   primarily on edaphic factors, time since the last burn, and year-to-year
   variation. We interpret the time effect as related to changes in species
   composition accompanying plant succession that followed disturbance
   either from cropping and heavy grazing on the loamy site or heavy
   grazing on the shallow site. Other unidentified factors also have a role
   in vegetation dynamics on this prairie. Community composition and
   species richness were not consistently responsive to frequency of
   growing-season fires.}},

Abstract = {{The Norwegain mountains have had a central role in the subsistence
   agroecosystems by providing vast biological resources for humans and
   their livestock since 4000-3500 BP as indicated by paleoecological
   records. Later with the development of the summer farming system the use
   of the mountains was intensified. This long-term use of the mountains
   has shaped a montane cultural landscape by livestock grazing, mowing for
   hay, fuel collection and a variety of other uses. The result is a
   significant increase of the grassland areas at the expense of the
   forest. Those semi-natural grasslands and heathlands with specific
   biological diversity have until recently dominated the mountains but are
   today decreasing due to forest invasion - which in turn is a result of
   changes in human land use. The present paper focuses on changes in
   landscape pattern and differences in landscape development in two
   mountain valleys with summer farming activities, in Mid-Norway, over the
   period 1960s-1990s, and seeks to interpret the changes in relation to
   differential land use and environmental factors. This study contributes
   examples from human shaped ecosystems in mountains where the
   fragmentation of semi-natural habitats is addressed. A set of landscape
   pattern indices commonly used in landscape ecological studies is also
   used here, and their ecological relevance in the present context is
   dealt with. The implications of changed land use for biodiversity
   conservation in those mountains and the relationships to future
   sustainable agriculture is also briefly discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term agricultural experiments such as the Temperate Pastures
   Sustainability Key Program (TPSKP) present significant challenges in the
   areas of planning and design, conduct, analysis and reporting. This
   paper concentrates on 2 aspects, namely, the experimental design and the
   statistical analysis.
   For long-term agricultural experiments which examine the effects of
   management strategies over time, an enumeration of the initial
   biodiversity is essential and permits the allocation of treatments to
   plots in such a way that potential bias in the estimation of treatment
   effects due to lack of uniformity in experimental units (plots) is
   reduced in the covariate analysis. Spatial replication is considered
   essential and the design should include at least 2 starting dates for
   management strategies so that the possible interaction between the year
   of start and the management strategy can be described.
   The data resulting from repeated measurement of herbage mass of major
   individual species or species groups represent a longitudinal data set
   with complexity due to the staggered commencement of treatments and also
   in part due to the nature of some of the strategies (closure and cuts).
   The analysis presented is the cubic smoothing spline approach of Verbyla
   et al. (1999) which integrates cubic splines, random coefficients,
   covariance modelling and estimation of systematic deviation. This
   approach, based on linear mixed models and using residual maximum
   likelihood (REML) has the flexibility to cope with the staggered
   imposition of management strategies and permits the partitioning of
   trends into smooth and non-smooth components, thereby quantifying
   species persistence and seasonal influence under each management
   strategy.}},

Journal = {{FOLIA GEOBOTANICA}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{125-141}},
Abstract = {{Dispersal limitation is often involved when the species composition of a
   dry abandoned grassland shows a slow response to resumed regular mowing.
   A seed-addition experiment, using 32 species which do not belong to the
   local species pool, was performed on Monte San Giorgio (southern
   Switzerland) to test whether the low recruitment success was due to
   dispersal limitation or due to unfavourable microsite conditions. In
   October 1997, 20 species were individually sown in six 3 x 4 m blocks of
   a 2 x 2 factorial ``partial{''} split-plot design with treatments of
   abandonment vs, mowing and undisturbed vs. root-removed soil, this last
   being applied in small naturally-degradable pots. Moreover, 12 species
   were sown only in the treatments on undisturbed soil. Seedlings of sown
   and spontaneously germinating seeds were observed on 16 occasions over
   one 12-month period.
   Seeds of 31 out of the 32 species germinated. Twenty-four species showed
   germination rates higher than 5\% and different seasonal germination
   patterns. Established vegetation, especially the tussocks of Molinia
   arundinacea, reduced the quality of microsites for germination. Whereas
   a few species germinated better under the litter of Molinia arundinacea,
   many more germinated better under the more variable microsite conditions
   of a mown grassland.
   Only a few seedlings of 25 species out of the 31 germinated species
   survived until October 1998. Seedling survival was negatively affected
   by litter, unfavourable weather conditions (frost and dry periods
   followed by heavy rains) and herbivory (slugs and grasshoppers).
   Tussocks of Molinia arundinacea, however, tended to protect seedlings.
   The poor establishment success of ``new{''} species observed in
   abandoned meadows on Monte San Giorgio after resumed mowing is due to
   dispersal and microsite limitations.}},

Abstract = {{Disjunct populations of the perennial herb Gypsophila fastigiata L.
   (Caryophyllaceae) on the Baltic island of bland were monitored during a
   thirteen-year study. The main objectives were to analyze the dynamic
   features of G. fastigiata within and among sub-populations in shorter
   and longer time perspectives, and to relate this to habitat
   characteristics and patterns in local weather variation. The total
   number of individuals decreased and the proportion of reproductive
   individuals increased throughout the study period. Recruitment and
   mortality on a fine spatial scale (0.25 m(2)) were negatively correlated
   to species richness and vegetation cover. Rapid changes in population
   sizes were observed during and after summers with low precipitation. The
   highest mortality rates were found in pre-reproductive stages whereas
   relatively many of the adult plants survived the droughts. The long-term
   trend of population decline in G. fastigiata could be a result of
   changes in vegetation structure due to changing grazing regimes. It
   might also be an effect of more frequent dry summers during the second
   half of the observation period or of an interaction between weather and
   changes in management. Another interpretation is that dynamic processes

Abstract = {{Somalia has the longest national coastline (3025 km) in Africa with an
   estimated shelf area (depth 0-200 m) of 32500 km(2). The country is
   divided into the northern coastal plain of Guban, which has a semi-arid
   terrain; the northern highlands with rugged mountain ranges containing
   the country's highest peak (2407 m); and the Ogaden region which
   descends to the south from the highlands and which consists of shallow
   plateau valleys, wadis and broken mountains. The latter region continues
   to the Mudug plain in central Somalia.
   From Ras Caseyr to the Kenya border, the coast runs north-east to
   south-west, coinciding with the displacement caused by the Mesozoic
   marginal subsidence. This general structure is complicated by
   sedimentary troughs crossing the Horn of Africa, and by large
   sedimentary basins, cutting the coastline and extending inland into
   Southern Somalia and Northern Kenya (Juba-Lamu embayment, Mogadishu
   basin). Offshore, the western Somali Basin extends from Socotra to the
   Comores. The open shelf environments developed along the Somali coast
   are a consequence of an extensive marine transgression, connected to
   coastal subsidence or inland uplift.
   The rocks along the southern coastal belt are Pliocene-Pleistocene, and
   are characterized by a sequence of both marine and continental deposits
   of skeletal sands, coral build-ups, eolian sands and paleosols. As well
   as eolian and biogenic sedimentary processes, sea-level fluctuations,
   Holocene climatic changes and neotectonic movements have combined to
   produce the modern coastline. A notable feature is an ancient dune ridge
   complex, known as the Merka red dune, which rims the coast extending
   beyond the Kenyan border and which separates the narrow coastal belt
   from the Uebi Shebeli alluvial plain. Two features of note are the
   Bajuni Archipelago, which consists of islands, islets and skerries,
   forming a barrier island separated from the coast by a narrow marine
   sound, and a braided, channelized coastal area, which originated from
   the drowning of a paleofluvial net.
   The southern Somali coast, with that of Kenya and Tanzania, forms part
   of the Somali Current Large Marine Ecosystem, encompassing 700 000
   km(2), and extending 800 km between Dar es Salaam and Ras Hafun.
   Abundant biomass develops here due to upwelling. The shelf area has a
   wide variety of coral reefs, mangroves, seagrass meadows, beaches and
   estuaries. In shallow water areas the abraded flats are colonized by
   scattered coral communities with variable cover. A true fringing reef is
   achieved in places only in the Bajuni archipelago. All along the
   southern Somali coastal shelf there are spreading meadows of
   Thalassodendron seagrass, and benthic communities typical of mobile
   sandy substrates are limited to beach ridges and shoals developed along
   the coastline. Around the Bajuni barrier island and the channelized area
   there is more diversity. Mangroves grow on the tidal belts of the
   channels, and there are expanses of salt flats.
   Large-scale alteration produced by man on the Somali coast is relatively
   recent, but has accelerated in the last few decades, especially around
   major cities. This alteration affects especially backshore areas where
   the Pleistocene coral reefs are quarried. At present, the continental
   shelf is not adequately monitored or protected, so coastal habitats are
   being degraded, living marine resources are overexploited, and pollution
   levels are increasing, all of which affect natural resources and
   biodiversity.
   Somalia is one of the world's poorest and least developed countries,
   with few resources and devastated by civil war, but since 1993 it has
   been part of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA).
   This will affect fisheries and aquaculture in terms of the investment,
   production, trade and fish consumption of the member states. There are
   currently no marine protected areas and no legislation concerning their
   establishment and management, although the World Conservation Monitoring
   Centre (WCMC) Protected Areas Database lists Busc Busc Game Reserve as
   an MPA. In 1992, The WCMC also listed the following coastal sites as
   proposed protected areas: Zeila (important sea bird colonies on offshore
   islets), Jowhar-Warshek, Awdhegle-Gandershe. The area from Kisimayo to
   Ras Chiambone is probably of highest priority, as it is important for
   coral reefs, marine turtles, and mangrove resources, although it is
   still poorly known. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fragments of kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides) forest provide a major
   opportunity for conservation of indigenous biodiversity in the heavily
   deforested landscape of the Waikato Basin, New Zealand. However, there
   is little documented information on what indigenous fauna survives in
   these fragments. Using Malaise traps set 20 m and 50 m into fragments
   and 20 m and 50 m into the adjacent pasture, we analysed the beetle
   (Coleoptera) assemblages associated with two such kahikatea forest
   fragments in the south Waikato Basin in order to determine the scope of
   biotic invasion by adventive species and use of the surrounding pasture
   by indigenous species. A total of 3706 beetles were caught, encompassing
   37 families and 206 recognisable taxonomic units. The forest fragments
   had a sharply defined edge, and were dominated by indigenous beetle
   species, with only a few adventive species present. Beetle assemblages
   sampled in the surrounding pasture were numerically dominated by
   adventive species. Despite no indigenous plant species being present in
   the pastures, 55 indigenous beetles species (61\% of total species
   sampled in the pasture) were recorded in this habitat. Traps in the
   pasture of greatest floral diversity caught the most indigenous beetle
   species. Beetles of the detritivore guild dominated the samples from
   forest, but in samples from pasture, detritovores and predatores were
   co-dominant. Indigenous herbivore species were poorly represented in
   samples from pasture compared to other guilds. The kahikatea fragments
   have a rich indigenous beetle fauna and represent important refuges in
   the pastoral landscape of the Waikato. Many indigenous species are
   utilising the pasture to some degree, although their abundance and
   species richness declines with distance from the forest edge. This may
   have implications for successful dispersal to new patches. Species that
   could potentially be used as indicators of kahikatea forest fragment
   community structure and its resistance to invasion are suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The objectives are to relate species distributions among 110
   non-fertilized grassland ('dry meadow') sites in southeastern Sweden to

   conditions, water-retaining properties, soil texture and contents of
   organic matter, as well as degree of grazing, total cover of the
   vegetation and exposure (inclination and orientation) of the sites, to a
   variable extent are able to account for the intersite distribution of
   vascular plant species. Frequent enough to consider separately were 64
   species. A majority of them displayed significant relationships, either
   positive or negative, to soil acidity. At least 10 species were related
   to both soil acidity and grazing and/or exposure, and another 10 species
   mainly (always positively) to grazing and/or exposure. The distribution
   of 8-10 species was closely positively related to the phosphorus status
   of the soils, mainly plants which are even more abundant in fertilized
   pastures or abandoned fields. Magnesium appeared important to the
   distribution of at least 6 species and K to a few. Many variables tested
   including those related to water-retaining properties and soil texture,

Journal = {{NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},

Abstract = {{A period without management had transformed the vegetation of a
   species-rich fenmeadow, with no external change in the hydrological
   regime, into three communities: alder thicket (unmanaged 15 years), tall
   herb and sedge dominated communities (unmanaged 11 years). Following
   reintroduction of management (felling of alder thicket, mowing and
   grazing) the vegetation development was monitored and species cover was
   measured along a permanent transect before and during 12 years of
   restoration succession. Management increased the density of fenmeadow
   species and made the three communities more similar. The appearance of
   new fen species and the increase in species density followed immediately
   after the introduction of management. Thereafter, only a few new species
   appeared and the turnover index stabilised. Management by mowing and
   grazing both increased species density of herbs and promoted
   establishment of biennials and hemicryptophytes. Other plant groups
   responded differently to management: mowing increased total cover, the
   cover of grasses, and promoted phanerophytes and chamaephytes; grazing
   reduced the influence of these groups and promoted `sedge \& rush' and
   geophytes. Restoration was particularly successful in the felled alder
   thicket, but the success was caused by spreading of species from the
   pool of species within the site and establishment of species having
   persistent seed bank, i.e. inherent good potential for restoration. The
   results are discussed in relation to use of functional plant groups and
   Ellenberg N- and L-indices as response indicators for monitoring
   restoration progress.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of habitat fragmentation on species diversity and
   herbivore-parasitoid interactions were analyzed using the insect
   community of seed feeders and their parasitoids in the pods of the bush
   vetch (Vicia sepium L.). Field studies were carried out on 18 old
   meadows differing in area and isolation. The area of these meadows was
   found to be the major determinant of species diversity and population
   abundance of endophagous insects. Effects of isolation were further
   analyzed experimentally mentally using 16 small plots with potted vetch
   plants isolated by 100-500 m from vetch populations on large old
   meadows. The results showed that colonization success greatly decreased
   with increasing isolation. In both cases, insect species were not
   equally affected. Parasitoids suffered more from habitat loss and
   isolation than their phytophagous hosts. Minimum area requirements,
   calculated from logistic regressions, were higher for parasitoids than
   for herbivores. In addition, percent parasitism of the herbivores
   significantly decreased with area loss and increasing isolation of Vicia
   sepium plots, supporting the trophic-level hypothesis of island
   biogeography. Species with high rates of absence on meadows and isolated
   plant plots were not only characterized by their high trophic level, but
   also by low abundance and high spatial population variability. Thus
   conservation of large and less isolated habitat remnants enhances
   species diversity and parasitism of potential pest insects, i.e., the
   stability of ecosystem functions.}},

Journal = {{PLANT AND SOIL}},
Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{220}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{35-47}},
Abstract = {{Restoration of wet grassland communities on peat soils involves
   management of nutrient supply and hydrology. The concept of nutrient
   limitation was discussed as well as its interaction with drainage and
   rewetting of severely drained peat soils. Different methods of assessing
   nutrient limitation were compared and the type and extent of nutrient
   limitation were determined for several wet grassland communities. It was
   concluded that a full-factorial field fertilisation experiment is the
   most preferable method. Plant tissue analyses and soil chemical analyses
   were considered less suitable, although they may provide helpful
   additional information. Fertilisation experiments in the laboratory
   using sods or using test plants appear to be the proper means to study
   mechanisms or processes, but have a restricted predictive value for
   field situations. Generalising the results, it seems that many
   relativily undisturbed grassland plant communities on peaty soils are
   characterised by N limitation. Phosphate limitation for vegetation on
   peat soils is mainly observed in specific circumstances such as extreme
   calcium richness, high concentrations of Fe or as a result of drainage
   or long-term hay cropping. The latter two may also cause K limitation.
   Rewetting is regarded as a prerequisite in restoring wet grassland
   communities. Further restoration measures to influence nutrient
   availability depend on aims of the management and the individual site
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Tropical and subtropical forests once covered large areas of Central and
   South America. An important member of forests of the southern hemisphere
   is the genus Araucaria. Because of clear cutting only small remnants of
   Araucaria angustifolio forests still exist in Southern Brazil. Attempts
   at reforestation have had only limited success because of lack of
   knowledge about the environmental requirements of this species. This is
   especially true with respect to the root/fungus symbiosis (mycorrhiza)
   which is necessary for enhanced water and nutrient uptake and present in
   more than 90\% of land plants. Analysis of the root systems of Araucaria
   trees from forest and grassland (campo) sites revealed mycorrhizal
   structures (appressoria, penetration and coiled hyphae, vesicles,
   arbuscules, spores) which are characteristic for the arbuscular
   mycorrhiza (AM) type. The spores of AM fungi at both sites - forest and
   campo - were identified. The biodiversity at the forest site was much
   higher, with 13 species, whereas only 6 different species could be
   identified at the campo site. Glomus and Acaulospora were the only
   genera present at the campo. The forest, however, also contained spores
   of Entrophospora and Scutellospora. In addition to the greater
   biodiversity, the spore number in soil as well as the percent
   mycorrhizal colonization in roots were significantly higher at the
   forest site than at the campo site. Because of the low frequency of
   hyphal coils and the dominating intercellular growth of hyphae, these
   mycorrhizas can be classified as an Arum-type, which is the first report
   of this kind in gymnosperms.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of cattle grazing on ant diversity, species composition and

   of the Northern Territory, using distance from water as a surrogate of

   Kidman Springs (5 plots), the other on black cracking clay at Mount
   Sanford (6 plots). Sites were sampled in April (both sites) and October
   (Kidman Springs only)1998. The two sites supported distinctly different
   ant communities, with 70 species at Kidman Springs and 36 at Mount
   Sanford. Species richness and total abundance did not change
   significantly with distance from water, although species richness was
   always greatest at the most distant plot. However, multivariate analysis
   showed that ant species composition changed markedly. Despite large
   changes in species composition, the abundance of only six of the 24 most
   common species (two at Kidman Springs and four at Mount Sanford) were
   significantly correlated with grazing intensity. The abundance of
   Bassian taxa was promoted by grazing, whereas the species richness of
   Torresian taxa and the abundance and species richness of Widespread taxa
   were suppressed. Ant functional group analysis showed community
   organisation was resilient, with slight changes being primarily driven
   by Hot Climate Specialists and dependent on the season. However, the
   relative richness of five functional groups correlated significantly
   with grazing intensity, all negatively. Ant variables suppressed by
   grazing were positively associated with patch cover variables and
   litter, and negatively correlated with annual grass and bare ground, and
   may serve as indicators of rangeland condition.}},

Abstract = {{Tree clearing to improve pasture production for beef cattle is becoming
   more commonplace in the rangeland zone in Queensland. In parts of the
   Desert Uplands region of Central Queensland, current clearing rates are
   among the highest in Australia. The state government, in granting
   permits for clearing, has to balance the improved production benefits,
   accruing mostly to pastoralists, against the biodiversity losses, which
   are borne more widely by Australian society. In the current debate over
   clearing restrictions, little information exists about the values that
   society may hold for the preservation of rangelands. To address this
   deficiency, a choice modelling study was undertaken to provide estimates
   of the benefits of retaining remnant vegetation that are appropriate for
   inclusion in a benefit cost analysis of tighter clearing restrictions.
   Attributes included in the choice model were reductions in the
   population size of non-threatened species and unique ecosystems, the
   number of endangered species lost to the region, and changes in regional
   income and employment. The benefits estimated for individual attributes,
   and for some more restrictive policy settings are reported.}},

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{257-266}},

Abstract = {{. In an experiment in a limestone grassland on the Baltic island of
   Oland, SE Sweden, nutrient and water supply, light intensity and grazing
   regime were altered in 10 combinations during four years in 10 plots of
   0.25 m2 with subplots of 0.01 m2 and 0.0004 m2. Only the combined
   application of fertilizer and shade led to a strong decrease in average
   species richness (S1) at all scales. When comparing species numbers
   summed up over all 10 replicates of each treatment (Sn) at the three
   quadrat sizes, differences in effect of these treatments were much
   smaller, and were so already at the finest scale. a-diversity, measured
   as (Sn - S1 was quite constant over different scales for most
   treatments, i.e. diversity did not increase with an increase in scale.
   The richness ratioSn/S1 decreased with increasing scale, indicating an
   increasing degree of homogeneity at larger scales. Treatments which only
   included fertilizer or shade, maintained high species richness; this
   high richness was also maintained in combination with grazing and could
   then be explained by the denser packing of vegetation. Patterns of
   species richness were correlated at the large scale, but not at the
   finer scales, indicating a high degree of spatial and temporal
   heterogeneity at the finer scales. With increasing quadrat size species
   persistence increased which explains the small effect of certain
   treatments. Clearly, a range of scales has to be sampled in this type of
   vegetation to be able to measure different patterns, which may occur
   under different experimental treatments. The finest scale in this study
   can become too small, when certain treatments result in a coarse-grained
   vegetation pattern. The quadrat size of 10 cm x 10 cm should be included
   in the range of scales. It combines accuracy in sampling with efficiency
   in time effort, a reasonably large number of species sampled, and a
   strong differentiation in the effects of the various treatments.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to propose the preservation of buffaloes not
   only as productive livestock, but also as a part of the biodiversity of
   wetlands and especially of the Greek wetlands. The water buffalo used to
   be an integral part of the biodiversity of many Greek wetland
   ecosystems, enriched their landscape, and provided invaluable services
   and products to the rural people and to the economy in general. Its
   total population before the 1950s was over 100,000 animals. presently,
   it is found only in four wetland sites in Macedonia and Thrace and in
   the estuaries of Rivers Gallikos and Axios, with a total population of a
   few hundred animals. These wetlands are Ramsar Sites. Even this small
   population is threatened with immediate extinction because of the
   rapidly changing rural socio-economic conditions and the expansion of
   cultivated fields into wet meadows. Farmers and consumers are rapidly
   losing contact with this mammal and its products. This species possesses
   minimum requirements for treatment and is characterised by the ability
   of utilising roughage of variable nutritional value. These factors are
   promising to render buffalo breeding a valuable branch of the Greek

Abstract = {{Nutrient-poor, serpentinitic soils in the San Francisco Bay area sustain
   a native grassland that supports many rare species, including the Bay
   checkerspot butterfly (Euphydryas editha bayensis). Nitrogen (N)
   deposition from air pollution threatens biodiversity in these grasslands
   because N is the primary limiting nutrient for plant growth on
   serpentinitic soils. I investigated the role of N deposition through
   surveys of butterfly and plant populations across different grazing
   regimes, by literature revives, and with estimates of N deposition in
   the region. Several populations of the butterfly in south San Jose
   crashed following the cessation of cattle grazing. Nearby populations
   under continued grazing did not suffer similar declines. The immediate
   cause of the population crashes was rapid invasion by introduced annual
   grasses that crowded out the larval host plants of the butterfly.
   Ungrazed serpentinitic grasslands on the San Francisco Peninsula have
   largely resisted grass invasions for nearly four decades. Several lines
   of evidence indicate that dry N deposition from smog is responsible for
   the observed grass invasion. Fertilization experiments have shown that
   soil N limits grass invasion in serpentinitic soils. Estimated N
   deposition rates in south San Jose grasslands are 10-15 kg N/ha/year;
   Peninsula sites have lower deposition, 4-6 kg N/ha/year. Grazing cattle
   select grasses over fobs, and grazing leads to a net export of N as
   cattle are removed for slaughter. Although poorly managed cattle grazing
   can significantly disrupt native ecosystems, in this case moderate,
   well-managed grazing is essential for maintaining native biodiversity in
   the face of invasive species and exogenous inputs of N from nearby urban
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{The consequences of permanent loss of species or species groups from
   plant communities are poorly understood, although there is increasing
   evidence that individual species effects are important in modifying
   ecosystem properties. We conducted a field experiment in a New Zealand
   perennial grassland ecosystem, creating artificial vegetation gaps and
   imposing manipulation treatments on the reestablishing vegetation.
   Treatments consisted of continual removal of different subsets or
   ``functional groups{''} of the flora. We monitored vegetation and soil
   biotic and chemical properties over a 3-yr period.
   Plant competitive effects were clear: removal of the C-3 grass Lolium
   perenne L. enhanced vegetative cover, biomass, and species richness of
   both the C-4 grass and dicotyledonous weed functional groups and had
   either positive or negative effects on the legume Trifolium repens L.,
   depending on season. Treatments significantly affected total plant cover
   and biomass; in particular, C-4 grass removal reduced total plant
   biomass in summer, because no other species had appropriate phenology.
   Removal of C-4 grasses reduced total root biomass and drastically
   enhanced overall shoot-to-root biomass ratios. Aboveground net primary
   productivity (NPP) was not strongly affected by any treatment,
   indicating strong compensatory effects between different functional
   components of the flora.
   Removing all plants often negatively affected three further trophic
   levels of the decomposer functional food web: microflora,
   microbe-feeding nematodes, and predaceous nematodes. However, as long as
   plants were present, we did not find strong effects of removal
   treatments, NPP, or plant biomass on these trophic groupings, which
   instead were most closely related to spatial variation in soil chemical
   properties across all trophic levels, soil N in particular. Larger
   decomposer organisms, i.e., Collembola and earthworms, were unresponsive
   to any factor other than removal of all plants, which reduced their
   populations. We also considered five functional components of the soil
   biota at finer taxonomic levels: three decomposer components
   (microflora, microbe-feeding nematodes, predaceous nematodes) and two
   herbivore groups (nematodes and arthropods). Taxa within these five
   groups responded to removal treatments, indicating that plant community
   composition has multitrophic effects at higher levels of taxonomic
   resolution. The principal ordination axes summarizing community-level
   data for different trophic groups in the soil food web were related to
   each other in several instances, but the plant ordination axes were only
   significantly related to those of the soil microfloral community. There
   were time lag effects, with ordination axes of soil-associated
   herbivorous arthropods and microbial-feeding nematodes being related to
   ordination axes representing plant community structure at earlier
   measurement dates. Taxonomic diversity of some soil organism groups was
   linked to plant removals or to plant diversity. For herbivorous
   arthropods, removal of C-4 grasses enhanced diversity; there were
   negative correlations between plant and arthropod diversity, presumably
   because of negative influences of C-4 species in the most diverse
   treatments. There was evidence of lag relationships between diversity of
   plants and that of the three decomposer groups, indicating multitrophic
   effects of altering plant diversity.
   Relatively small effects of plant removal on the decomposer food web
   were also apparent in soil processes regulated by this food web.
   Decomposition rates of substrates added to soils showed no relationship
   with treatment, and rates of CO2 evolution from the soil were only
   adversely affected when all plants were removed. Few plant
   functional-group effects on soil nutrient dynamics were identified.
   Although some treatments affected temporal variability (and thus
   stability) of soil biotic properties (particularly CO2 release)
   throughout the experiment, there was no evidence of destabilizing
   effects of plant removals.
   Our data provide evidence that permanent exclusion of plant species from
   the species pool can have important consequences for overall vegetation
   composition in addition to the direct effects of vegetation removal, and
   various potential effects on both the above- and belowground subsystems.
   The nature of many of these effects is driven by which plant species are
   lost from the system, which depends on the various attributes or traits
   of these species.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that phytophagous insects would have a strong
   top-down effect on early successional plant communities and would thus
   alter the course of succession. To lest this hypothesis, we suppressed
   above-ground insects at regular intervals with a broad-spectrum
   insecticide through the first 3 years of old-field succession at three
   widely scattered locations in central New York State. Insect herbivory
   substantially reduced total plant biomass to a similar degree at all
   three sites by reducing the abundance of meadow goldenrod, Solidago
   altissima. As a result, Euthamia graminifolia dominated control plots
   whereas S. altissima dominated insecticide-treated plots by the third
   year of succession. S, altissima is the dominant old-field herbaceous
   species in this region but typically requires at least 5 years to become
   dominant. Past explanations for this delay have implicated colonization
   limitation whereas our data demonstrate that insect herbivory is a
   likely alternative explanation. A widespread, highly polyphagous insect,
   the xylem-tapping spittlebug, Philaenus spumarius, appeared to be the
   herbivore responsible for the reduction in standing crop biomass at all
   three sites. Insect herbivory typically caused little direct leaf tissue
   loss for the ten plant species we examined, including S. altissima.
   Consequently, the amount of leaf area removed was not a reliable
   indicator of the influence of insect herbivory on standing crop biomass
   or on early succession. Overall, we found a strong top-down effect of
   insect herbivores on biomass at several sites, so our results may be
   broadly applicable. These findings run counter to generalizations that
   top-down effects of herbivores, particularly insects, are weak in
   terrestrial systems. These generalizations may not apply to insects,
   such as spittlebugs, that can potentially mount an effective defense
   (i.e., spittle) against predators and subsequently reach relatively high
   abundance on common plant species. Our results suggest that insect
   herbivory may play an important but often overlooked role during early
   old-field succession.}},

Volume = {{87}},

Abstract = {{We studied the spatial pattern of species richness in the mountain
   grasslands of central Argentina, where three distinct vegetation types
   occur: shortgrass in shallow soils. tallgrass in deeper soils and Het
   turf in moist depressions. The shortgrass community had the highest
   vascular plant species richness on different scales. the maximal number
   of vascular plant species per m(2) was 89. The richness within the
   shortgrass vegetation was not related to spatial location or soil depth.
   Small-scale species richness was significally positively related to the
   size of the community species pool. Within shortgrass and tallgrass
   communities, the floristic similarity between stands was higher when
   they were located closer to each other. This pattern was interpreted as
   showing the internal diaspore limitation. The number of species in
   shortgrass vegetation was significantly positively dependent on the
   proximity of tallgrass stands. Also, floristic similarity between
   shortgrass and other communities (tallgrass and wet turf) was
   significantly higher when stands were located closer in space. This
   pattern was interpreted as showing the external diaspore limitation,
   called also spatial mass effect - other communities act as seed donors
   and increase the number of species coexisting in the shortgrass
   community. The mean height of the predominating species was lower in the
   shortgrass than in the tallgrass or wet turf communities. In communities
   with a tall canopy, species composition and richness were not dependent
   on surrounding communities, which may he explained by the relatively
   more significant competition for light there. In the shortgrass
   community, where the canopy is lower, the pattern of species richness
   was related to the vicinity of potential diaspore sources, which
   indicates the relative significance of internal and external diaspore
   limitation. The proportion of exotic species in the community was not
   related to the richness of native species. The highest proportion of
   exotics was observed in the wet turf community. which was also the one
   most heavily grazed.}},

Abstract = {{Ley cultivation by ploughing and fertilising constitute a severe impact
   on plant community patterns in semi-natural subalpine communities. Since
   the 1950ties, such cultivation have been an important part of the
   agroecosystem in subalpine areas in Norway, and regularly practised.
   Today, several former leys are left for grazing management. Plant
   species diversity and heterogeneity was studied in subalpine grasslands
   in Valdres, southern Norway (ca. 950 m a.s.l.) at different successional
   phases after ploughing. Fourteen sites (100 m(2)) varying from recently
   ploughed grasslands (3-5 years at phase 1) to unploughed sites were used
   to construct a temporal gradient by a space for time substitution.
   Small-scale species diversity (0.25 m(2)) of vascular plants increased
   continuously with the time since last ploughing, while the variation in
   gamma-diversity was minor among late successional phases 3-5 (> 23-28
   years, 32-39 years and unploughed sites) after an evident increase from
   phase 1-3. The number of exclusive species peaked within unploughed
   sites (10), and included perennial herbs (Antennaria alpina, Hieracium
   auricula, Viola canina), spore-producing species (Botrychium lunaria,
   Selaginella selaginoides) and woody life-forms. Species diversity of
   cryptogams was low at both a small and large scale within successional
   phases 1 and 2 (< 12 years). Small scale cryptogam diversity peaked at
   the unploughed sites, while gamma diversity peaked at phase 3 (23-28
   years). This intermediate phase 3 also had the highest number of
   exclusive species (12) which exceeded unploughed sites (8). A coarse
   spatial structure of cryptogams at phase 3 was indicated by a low mean
   of species distribution. The soil of uncultivated grasslands (phase 5)
   was, at the end of the growing season (mid August), quite base-rich with
   a higher content for all measured nutrients as compared to intermediate
   phases of continuity (phase 3 and 4) The exception was nitrate which was
   not detectable from phase 3 to 5, and available phosphate which peaked
   at an intermediate phase of succession (phase 3 and 4). Heterogeneity of
   vascular plants reached a minimum value at the intermediate phase (3)
   while cryptogam heterogeneity peaked at this phase. Differences in
   heterogeneity cycles among these species groups implies that structuring
   processes act on different temporal scales for vascular plants as
   compered to cryptogams along the successional gradient in grasslands
   after ploughing. The importance of continuity in management for plant
   biodiversity in subalpine grasslands is finally discussed from a
   conservation point of view.}},

Abstract = {{To more effectively manage remaining native grasslands and declining
   populations of prairie passerine birds, linkages between disturbance
   regimes, vegetation, and bird abundance need to be more fully
   understood. Therefore, we examined bird-habitat relationships on
   mixed-grass prairie at Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in
   northwestern North Dakota, where prescribed fire has been used as a
   habitat management tool since the 1970s. We sampled bird abundance on
   upland prairie at 310 point count locations during 1993 and 1994
   breeding seasons. We also measured vegetation structure and composition
   at each location. Complete fire histories were available for each point,
   with over 80\% having been burned one to four times in the previous 15
   years. Post-fire succession generally transformed vegetation structure
   from short, sparse, and grassy with few forbs and low litter immediately
   after fire, to increasing and moderate:amounts of forbs, litter, and
   shrubs two to eight years postfire, to tall, dense, shrubby prairie with
   little forb, grass, or litter understory when fire was absent (>80
   years). Most grassland birds (six of nine species examined) at Lostwood
   NWR were absent from prairie untreated with fire. Species richness and
   abundances of Baird's Sparrows (Ammodramus bairdii), Bobolinks
   (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), Grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum), Le
   Conte's Sparrows (A. leconteii), Sprague's Pipits (Anthus spragueii),
   and Western Meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta) were positively related to
   an index of amount of fire, and these species were absent from unburned
   units. In contrast, Common Yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) and
   Clay-colored Sparrows (Spizella pallida) both reached highest abundance
   on unburned prairie. To provide maximum grassland bird diversity,
   managers of mesic, mixed-grass prairie generally should provide areas
   with short (2-4 year), moderate (5-7 year), and long (8-10 year, or
   more) fire return intervals. Because long-term rest may create habitat
   unfavorable for most species of grassland passerines in mesic, northern
   mixed prairie, periodic defoliations by disturbances such as fire should
   be considered essential to restore and maintain native biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{We compared species diversity of plants and insects among grazed and
   ungrazed areas of Ponderosa pine-grassland communities in Arizona. Plant
   species richness was higher in two of three grassland communities that
   were grazed by native elk and deer and domestic cattle than in ungrazed
   areas inside a series of three large (approximately 40-ha) grazing
   exclosures. Similarly, plant species richness was higher in grazed areas
   relative to ungrazed areas at one of two series of smaller
   (approximately 25-m(2)) and short-term exclosure sites. Evenness of
   plant distribution, however, was greater inside ungrazed long-term
   exclosures but was reduced inside ungrazed short-term exclosures
   relative to grazed areas Relative abundances of forbs, grasses, trees,
   and shrubs, and native and introduced plants did not differ between the
   long- and short-term grazing exclosures and their grazed counterparts.
   Relative abundances of some plant species changed when grazers were
   excluded however. In contrast, insect species richness was not different
   between grazed and ungrazed habitats, although insect abundance

Abstract = {{Pollen analyses were carried out at two sites with contrasting land-use
   histories (in-field and out-land) within a single estate. The aim was to
   distinguish the relative importance of natural processes and cultural
   influence on the development of vegetation and biodiversity. The estate
   lies in the boreo-nemoral zone of southern Sweden, and attention is
   focused on the distribution of coniferous and deciduous trees. The
   in-fields, which lie close to the estate buildings, are currently
   dominated by deciduous trees, and have a documented history as fields
   and hay meadows. The more distant out-lands were primarily used as
   grazing land in the past, and support coniferous forest at present. The
   study covers the last 4000 yr. 2000-1000 BC: the out-lands site
   supported natural, dense forests consisting of Quercus, Betula, Tilia,
   Alnus and Corylus. 1000 BC-AD 1100: several events are best interpreted
   as an increased cultural activity in the area. Agriculture was based on
   animal husbandry and the recorded cereals probably originate from a kind
   of shifting cultivation. AD 1000-1800: agriculture intensified on the
   in-fields with cereal cultivation of increased importance, while the
   out-fields were used for slash-and-burn agriculture and forest grazing.
   The forests became more open in structure but the composition remained
   unchanged. An increase in Calluna was a possible consequence of
   over-exploitation. AD 1800 onwards: the out-field deciduous forests were
   rapidly replaced by Picea-Pinus coniferous forests during the 1800's.
   The in-fields retained deciduous forest with a continuity of Quercus and
   other species.
   There is a close, positive relationship between floristic diversity and
   cultural influence during the last 4000 yr. A comparison is made with a
   similar investigation on another estate in the region, revealing small
   differences between the estates, but striking similarities in the
   effects of land-use types on the development of vegetation. The
   significance of former in-fields for nature conservation is discussed,
   particularly as a potential source for increasing the deciduous
   component in commercial forestry practice.}},

Abstract = {{Serpentine meadows in Northern California supported higher species
   richness at the 1-m(2) scale than adjacent nonserpentine meadows, and
   had a considerably higher proportion of native species. Within each soil
   type, total species richness (natives plus aliens) was unrelated to
   biomass, cover, soil depth, or soil characteristics (N, P, Ca++, Mg++,
   water-holding capacity). However, the proportion of native species on
   serpentine was higher in meadows with lower levels of phosphorus and a
   lower calcium/magnesium ratio; the proportion of native species in
   nonserpentine meadows was higher on cool (north to northeast facing)
   slopes. At a regional scale, some of these effects were partly reversed;
   the rate at which new species accumulated with the addition of new
   sites, or beta diversity, was highest for native plant species in
   nonserpentine meadows. All of the above effects were independent of
   whether grazing by cattle was absent (removed 13 years ago) or present.
   The status of low-productivity serpentine soils as a refuge for native
   grassland species appears to be the result of their abiotic resistance
   to alien species, but not of a negative relationship between

Abstract = {{The wide variety of landforms, as well as climatic, and edaphic
   diversity have given rise to an heterogeneous landscape configuration,
   formed by finely fragmented habitats. This situation is enhanced by a
   long history of human occupation, specially on plain and undulating
   terrain. The environmental heterogeneity becomes apparent in the
   vegetation, which consists of an intricate aggregation of physiognomic
   types, representing stales and transitions triggered by human
   intervention An 18\% of Falcon State is occupied by desert vegetation,
   25\% by open, woodlands, and only 29\% of the terrain is covered by
   closed vegetation types. The remaining 28\% comprises the converted
   lands, mostly pasturelands, where desertification is in process. The
   main activity is extensile goat herding in the driest portions and
   cattle raising in the subhumid zones. Fine timber harvesting and
   column-cacti handcrafted furniture compete with goal raising for the
   native pasture. The latter is the main economic activity in Falcon
   Slate, first national producer of goals meat and milk.
   Extreme, or low probability events ale common in these highly
   diversified landscapes. The occurrence of various vegetation types in
   such varied edaphic and climatic situations as well as the uniform
   tendency towards deterioration through indiscriminated grazing
   (overexploitation or replacement of the native flora by undesirable
   species), calls for intelligent information gathering on landuse and
   evolution within the various environmental situations in the world. This
   should be a priority if global natural biodiversity is to be protected.
   The thorough interpretation of biodiversity changes occurring at
   species, plant physiognomy and spatial levels, during the varied and
   shifting landuse patterns in an area with such a long history of human
   occupation, should guide in the understanding of ecosystem functioning
   and in the selection of sustainable management approaches.
   With this frame of references in mind, we report on a vast (11.632
   km(2)), diverse (41 physiognomic types) and rich (974 species) set of
   ecosystems in the dry lands of Falcon State. We analyze the
   relationships between vegetation structure, physiognomy and
   biodiversity, as well as the consequences of human activity on these
   plant variables. This eco-evolutionary basis is expected to become a
   framework for a set of experiments which, if properly planned, should
   allow an intelligent and harmonious intervention in a short rime, not
   only to increase productivity but to enhance the ecosystem's dynamic
   stability.
   It is stated that biodiversity increases as structure becomes more
   complex, however, in Falcon species diversity of the primary structural
   groups shows two contrasting tendencies depending on available
   environmental humidity, as assessed by the Bailey's moisture index.
   Another usual statement is that productivity increases with increasing
   biodiversity; however, in the arid lands of Falcon the maximum
   biodiversity is achieved in conditions of high species richness and low
   total plant cover.
   The relationship between the Shannon index (H) and the Beard's system of
   formation series shows a tendency cowards an increase in H with a
   decrease in seasonal gradient; the lower the water str ess and the
   higher the structural complexity, the higher the biodiversity. In the
   edaphic plant formations, H is higher in and lower in the riparian
   forests dominated by a single plant cover is very high, and evenness and
   richness are very low. In the dry evergreen series, represented in
   Falcon by only one formation, biodiversity is intermediate.
   The tendency towards an increase in richness and H with the increase in
   humidity in the range from semiarid to subhumid, is apparent in all the
   communities regardless of tree layer density, tree species, where high,
   and evenness The desertic forests show lower H and richness than the
   closed forests within the arid end; but the relationship is reversed in
   the subhumid end of the humidity gradient.
   This results show that it is not possible to establish generalized
   assertions regarding the behaviour of biodiversity and richness, since
   these depend on the particular environmental situations, and on the
   variable used to quantify biodiversity (H or richness). Biodiversity is
   an heuristic tool for an approximation, from a little exploited angle,
   to the study of the record of strategies developed in the natural
   environment by the energy transducers that keep organized our Planet
   Earth.}},

Abstract = {{Aim: To identify biogeographical boundaries which are obscured by faunal
   overlap and habitat modification.
   Location: KwaZulu-Natal in south-east, South Africa beyond the southern
   tip of the Mocambique Coastal Plain.
   Methods: Species abundance data for dung beetles (Scarabaeidae:
   Scarabacinae) were collected at six levels from the coastal escarpment
   (30 degrees 16'S - 500 m) to the top of the nearby Drakensberg (29
   degrees 35'S - 2850 m). Cross-altitudinal boundaries were identified
   using clustering techniques, beta-diversity indices, and range edge
   analysis. Biogeographical data for the species were drawn from an
   extensive reference collection and used to classify the biogeographical
   affinities of the assemblages.
   Results: Three discrete communities are defined (<10\% similarity) from
   species abundance distributions. These communities occur in coastal
   forest (500 m), coastal to highveld grassland (500-1500 m), and montane
   grassland (1900-2850 m). Two of these communities are biogeographically
   homogeneous comprising >89\% east coast endemics (coastal forest) or
   >84\% South African montane endemics (montane grassland) in terms of
   abundance. The third community in coastal to highveld grassland is
   biogeographically more heterogeneous. Predominant biota of this
   community comprise both South African highveld endemics and elements
   with distributions extending into the tropics. At highveld levels (1500
   m), there are proportionately more highveld endemics whereas at lowland
   levels (500 m), there are proportionately more tropical elements. At
   1000 m, there was a change in the balance between these two groups
   across an anthropogenic gradient due to a decline in the proportion of
   endemics in favour of temperate/tropical generalists. This gradient from
   a natural grassland fragment to improved pastures of Kikuyu grass also
   parallels a decline in species richness and abundance. Species turnover
   analyses showed three different cross-altitudinal patterns. Range-edge
   analysis showed a trimodal pattern of species turnover (peaks in forest
   and the Drakensberg foothills as in the community analysis but also at
   (1000 m). Five beta-diversity indices showed either a bimodal pattern of
   turnover (forest/grassland and foothills/middle Drakensberg slopes) or a
   trimodal turnover pattern (forest/grassland, highveld Drakensberg
   foothills, Drakensberg peaks).
   Main conclusions: Clear altitudinal zonation is revealed by community
   and biogeographical analysis but one natural biogeographical boundary
   may be obscured by the process of habitat modification. This boundary at
   1000 m is revealed by range-edge analysis and is supported by findings
   for plant communities. Beta-diversity, species turnover patterns
   diverged slightly from those suggested by the community and range-edge
   analyses.}},

Abstract = {{Chronic overgrazing in the central Andes alters vegetation and may cause
   erosion and loss of productivity, but quantitative studies are lacking.
   We measured the relative influence of environmental factors and sheep
   grazing on local plant species composition, diversity, and soil organic
   matter in a remote site in northwestern Argentina. Using redundancy
   analysis, we found that environmental variables explained 22\% of
   variation in species composition between sites, while grazing-related
   variables explained 24\% of variation. The complete model, incorporating
   all significant variables, explained 33\% of variation. Aspect, season
   of grazing (wet vs, dry) combined with total vegetative cover, and soil
   type formed the basis for the first 3 ordination axes. Unpalatable or
   toxic species and very low-growing species were significantly more
   abundant on heavily grazed sites compared to relatively protected sites.
   Stocking rate in wet season pastures was negatively correlated with
   total cover, forage volume, soil organic matter, and species richness.
   Season of grazing had a more dramatic effect on total cover, forage
   volume, species diversity and soil organic matter, which were all
   significantly lower in wet season pastures compared to dry season
   pastures. Season of grazing and aspect interacted strongly: wet season
   pastures on north aspects appear more susceptible to degradation and
   changes in species composition than south-facing sites, Our results
   suggest that protecting pastures during the summer rainy season may be
   an important complement to traditional management efforts to reduce
   stocking rates.}},

Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{120}},

Abstract = {{We used data from a 15-year experiment in a C-4-dominated grassland to
   address the effects of community structure (i.e., plant species
   richness, dominance) and disturbance on invasibility, as measured by
   abundance and richness of exotic species. Our specific objectives were
   to assess the temporal and spatial patterns of exotic plant species in a
   native grassland in Kansas (USA) and to determine the factors that
   control exotic species abundance and richness (i.e., invasibility).
   Exotic species (90\% C-3 plants) comprised approximately 10\% of the
   flora, and their turnover was relatively high (30\%) over the 15-year
   period. We found that disturbances significantly affected the abundance
   and richness of exotic species. In particular, long-term annually burned
   watersheds had lower cover of exotic species than unburned watersheds,
   and fire reduced exotic species richness by 80-90\%. Exotic and native
   species richness were positively correlated across sites subjected to
   different fire (r = 0.72) and grazing (r = 0.67) treatments, and the
   number of exotic species was lowest on sites with the highest
   productivity of C-4 grasses (i.e., high dominance). These results
   provide strong evidence for the role of community structure, as affected
   by disturbance, in determining invasibility of this grassland. Moreover,
   a significant positive relationship between exotic and native species
   richness was observed within a disturbance regime (annually burned
   sites, r = 0.51; unburned sites, r = 0.59). Thus, invasibility of this
   C-4-dominated grassland can also be directly related to community

   The bird communities of these two regrowth forest types were sampled at
   six sites (9-13 years old) using mist-nets and observations. Bird
   species richness was similar between the two forest types. Cecropia
   regrowth, however, was richer for strictly forest bird species than was
   Vismia regrowth. Mixed-flock species and ant-following birds were
   significantly more abundant in the Cecropia second growth, whereas
   nonforest insectivores and omnivores were more common in Vismia
   regrowth. The type of regrowth was found to influence bird species

Abstract = {{Conservation of biodiversity in semi-natural pastures of Sweden is based
   mainly on management prescriptions to increase botanical values (i.e.,
   species richness of vascular plants confined to pastures), assuming
   plants to be good indicators of overall biodiversity We compared species
   richness and abundance of 29 species of farmland birds breeding in 88
   semi-natural pastures of different conservation value as evalutated by a
   nation-wide inventory of semi-natural pastures in Sweden. We tested
   whether there was an association Between existing measures of
   conservation value based mainly on the species richness and rarity of
   vascular plants, and three species richness subsets of farmland birds.
   Species richness of all farmland birds decreasing farmland birds, and
   dry pasture birds were not associated with the botanical conservation
   value of pastures. Pastures surrounded by open farmland contained
   significantly more farmland bird species and more decreasing farmland
   species than pastures located at forest-field edges within the same
   landscape. In addition, richness of all farmland bird species,
   decreasing farmland species, and decreasing dry pasture species
   increased significantly with increasing pasture area and increasing
   proportion of a short field layer (reflecting grazing intensity). The
   species richness of decreasing dry-pasture species of birds was also
   weakly positively correlated with the proportion of the field layer
   being artificially fertilized. Our results suggest that there are only
   weak relationships if any between species richness in birds and vascular
   plants at the local scale (2-15 ha), so using vascular plants as
   indicators of overall biodiversity may be unreliable. The present
   management prescription of intensive grazing to increase overall
   biodiversity is not supported by the literature on invertebrates, birds,
   and plants. We suggest that future management of semi-natural pastures
   should be revised to include a relaxed grazing intensity, which may
   increase heterogeneity of field layer height, allowing larger areas to
   be grazed with a given stock size, and may increase meat and milk
   production due to a higher quality of grazing.}},

Abstract = {{The impact of domestic livestock on soil properties and perennial
   vegetation is greatest close to water points and generally decreases
   exponentially with distance from water. We hypothesized that the impact
   of livestock on annual-plant communities would be similar to that on
   perennial vegetation. We used multivariate analysis and semivariograms
   to locate boundaries and to determine the number and width of different
   annual-plant zones (referred as biotic zones) on long-term livestock
   disturbance gradients in the northern Chihuahuan Desert, New Mexico. We
   estimated abundance of annuals in 0.5-m(2) quadrats placed at 30-m
   intervals on 10 livestock disturbance gradients originating at water
   points. Tansy mustard, Descurainia pinnata, was abundant in severely
   disturbed areas and also in area:; that art: known to have high soil
   nitrogen content. Amaranthus palmeri was abundant in half of the
   transects in the zones nearest the water points. The relationships of
   annual-plan; abundance and species richness with distance from water
   points and with perennial-plan: cover were not significant (R-2 < 0.1).
   The number of boundaries and sizes of zones varied with distance from
   water points, with seasons, and with duration of grazing. The first
   biotic zone (most severely impacted by cattle) ranged from 75 to 795 m
   radius for winter-spring annuals and from 165 to 1065 m radius for the
   summer annuals. Variability in the number and size of biotic zones along
   grazing gradients was spatially correlated with the frequency and
   intensity of disturbance, with landscape position, and with patchiness
   of soil features. There were fewer and larger zones of summer annuals
   than of winter-spring annuals. Boundary analysis of livestock
   disturbance gradients provided a method with replication for assessing
   the impact of long-term livestock grazing on annual-plant communities.
   Livestock create nutrient-rich patches near water points by mixing dung
   with soil by hoof action. These nutrient-rich patches support species of
   annuals that are rare or absent in areas where soils are subjected to
   low-intensity disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{In order to understand the variation of Estonian calcareous thin-soil
   grasslands on Ordovician or Silurian lime stone (alvars), 58 stands,
   distributed over the whole alvar region of Estonia, were described and
   clustered numerically using TABORD. Alvars are characterized by a high
   species richness. These mainly semi-natural communities have mostly
   developed after clear-cutting of forests. Grazing by domestic animals
   and removal of woody plants is needed for their maintenance. Primary
   (natural) alvar grasslands are found in a few places in coastal regions
   or in areas with thin-soil on monolithic bedrock. In data processing a
   whole stand, described by several small releves, was used in the
   classification as one description, including species frequencies as a
   quantitative measure. Seven clusters were separated and their
   configuration checked in a PCA-ordination. The resulting classification
   agreed with the previous `rough' classification. Both geographical and
   ecological factors were related with the clustering and the ordination.
   The broad classification units, suggested for Estonian alvar grasslands,
   were quite similar to the ones described earlier for alvar vegetation on
   Oland, Sweden. Clusters differed in their species richness,
   environmental conditions and life-form spectra. Differences in species
   richness were defined by regional species pools. Compared to earlier
   surveys, only a small fraction of alvars still remains in Estonia.
   Active conservation, i.e. suitable manage ment is needed to protect the
   still surviving valuable plant communities. The present study can
   provide guidelines on how to protect and manage different types of
   alvars in Estonia.}},

Abstract = {{There is much interest in the development of agricultural land
   management strategies aimed at enhancing reliance on ecosystem
   self-regulation rather than on artificial inputs such as fertilisers and
   pesticides. This study tested the usefulness of measures of soil
   microbial biomass and fungal:bacterial biomass ratios as indicators of
   effective conversion from an intensive grassland system, reliant mainly
   on fertilisers for crop nutrition, to a low-input system reliant mainly
   on self-regulation through soil biological pathways of nutrient
   turnover. Analysis of soils from a wide range of meadow grassland sites
   in northern England,along a gradient of long-term management intensity,
   showed that fungal:bacterial biomass ratios (measured by phospholipid
   fatty acid analysis; PLFA) were consistently and significantly higher in
   the unfertilised than the fertilised grasslands. There was also some
   evidence that microbial biomass, measured by chloroform fumigation and
   total PLFA, was higher in the unfertilised than in the fertilised
   grasslands. It was also found that levels of inorganic nitrogen (N), in
   particular nitrate-N, were significantly higher in the fertilised than
   in the unfertilised grasslands. However, microbial activity, measured as
   basal respiration, did not differ between the sites. A field
   manipulation trial was conducted to determine whether the reinstatement
   of traditional management on an improved mesotrophic grassland, for
   years, resulted in similar changes in the soil microbial community. It
   was found that neither the cessation of fertiliser applications nor
   changes in cutting and grazing management significantly affected soil
   microbial biomass or the fungal:bacterial biomass ratio. It is suggested
   that the lack of effects on the soil microbial community may be related
   to high residual fertility caused by retention of fertiliser N in the
   soil. On the basis of these results it is recommended that following the
   reinstatement of low-input management, the measurement of a significant
   increase in the soil fungal:bacterial biomass ratio, and perhaps total
   microbial biomass, may be an indicator of successful conversion to a
   grassland system reliant of self-regulation.}},

Abstract = {{We used a bird and mammal exclosure design on plowed ground to rest for
   the effects of granivory and herbivory by small vertebrates on early
   stages of tallgrass prairie succession. Seed predation by birds and
   browsing by rodents had major and additive impacts. In high- and
   low-density plantings, respectively, seed-eating birds reduced plant
   densities by 20\% and 23\% and grass biomass by 24\% and 34\%. Meadow
   voles did not affect plant numbers but reduced forb biomass by 35\% in
   high- and 57\% in low-density plantings. In high- and low-density plots,
   respectively, birds reduced species richness by 3\% and 17\% without
   influencing diversity; selective browsing by voles on two legumes and
   one coneflower left species number unaffected but reduced diversity by
   4\% and 25\% by accentuating dominance of already-prominent species.
   Bird effects were more pronounced in high-density plantings, while vole
   effects were most pronounced in low-density plantings.
   Results suggest that opportunistic finches and doves that seek out high
   seed concentrations depress tallgrass plant densities on open ground,
   while voles, which selectively forage on emerging vegetation, alter
   community structure, especially when their home ranges include

Abstract = {{The overwhelming majority of bird species in the Great Basin region are
   found in riparian habitats. However, most previous research on the
   impact of change in habitat condition through degradation on these bird
   communities failed to account for the large intersite differences in
   both habitat type and extent of degradation. We examined songbird
   communities in 4 riparian habitat types (meadows, willow-, birch-, and,
   aspen-dominated forest stands) during summers 1994 (last year of a 7-yr
   drought) and 1995 (following the 6th wettest winter recorded) in the
   Toiyabe Mountain Range of central Nevada. Habitat degradation
   significantly influenced bird species richness in riparian areas, but
   the impact was dependent upon habitat type. While meadow bird
   communities were affected adversely by habitat degradation, with
   significant drops in species richness on degraded sites, bird species
   richness in forested riparian habitats was consistently greater on
   degraded sites. Data for the 6 most common species seen during our study
   indicated that degradation may have influenced distribution of American
   Robins (Turdus migratorius) and Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia),
   but habitat type was the best predictor of abundance for House Wrens
   (Troglodytes aedon), Red-naped. Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis),
   Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus), and Brewer's Blackbirds (Euphagus
   cyanocephalus). Avian species diversity in meadow habitats may be linked
   to moisture levels during specific times of the year. Diversity
   increased during the pre-migratory period of the dry year (1994) when
   compared with that of the breeding season, but was unchanged in the wet

Abstract = {{This study investigates the effects of field manipulations of local
   climate to determine the potential impact of climate change on plant
   community dynamics in a calcareous grassland. The experimental site is
   located in a grassland at the Wytham estate, Oxfordshire, UK. The one
   hectare study area is within a 10 ha abandoned arable field on Jurassic
   corallian limestone. Two climate change scenarios were used: warmer
   winters with increased summer rainfall and warmer winters with summer
   drought. Plant cover and species richness were significantly increased
   in plots receiving supplemented summer rainfall, while the amount of
   litter was significantly reduced. Litter formation was significantly
   increased by winter warming and drought. The responses of the plant
   community to the climate manipulations were related to the life-history
   attributes of the dominant species. Seedling recruitment was limited by
   microsite availability, which also varied in the different climate
   manipulations. The results are discussed in terms of successional
   dynamics. They suggest that warmer winters may delay succession, as gap
   formation in the sward will provide sites for colonisation of annuals,
   thereby enabling their persistence in the sward. Under wetter conditions
   during summer, perennial grasses tend to close the sward, thereby
   inhibiting the establishment of later successional species.}},

Abstract = {{A seed rain study in semi-arid central Tanzania was conducted with the
   objective of providing guidelines on how to rehabilitate the degraded
   vegetation on the hillslopes of the Kondoa Irangi. The seed rain
   included predominantly wind-dispersed diaspores which accounted for 78\%
   of the species (45 out of 57) and 97\% of the diaspores, The density
   ranged from 230 to 1667 seeds m(-2) over an 8-month period. Both species
   richness and seed density were negatively correlated with vegetation
   cover. The increasing seed densities with decreasing vegetation cover
   signifies the importance of anemochory in areas undergoing regeneration
   succession. Cluster analysis of the seed rain data based on squared
   Euclidean distances produced a dendrogram with three distinct clusters,
   representing anemochorous seeds, epi-zoochorous seeds and a mixture of
   both, but dominated by seeds with no obvious dispersal appendages.
   Management including controlled re-introduction of livestock to the
   hills to increase nitrogen mineralization, species diversity and to
   reduce grass biomass, and hence the severity of fires, may be an
   appropriate solution to speed up the vegetation recovery process.}},

Abstract = {{Habitat fragmentation can leave formerly widespread habitat types

   these remnants is frequently compromised by ongoing disturbance. In
   northern Victoria, grazing of woodland remnants by sheep and cattle has
   profound effects on the vegetation structure of the woodland by removing
   understorey and ground vegetation. To investigate the effects of grazing
   pressure on remnant grey box Eucalyptus microcarpa woodland in northern
   Victoria, we surveyed the ground invertebrate fauna in ungrazed woodland
   remnants, grazed woodland remnants, and grazed pasture. The number of
   invertebrates caught increased from ungrazed woodland to grazed woodland
   to pasture, but this increase was due primarily to the most abundant
   orders (Hymenoptera, Coleoptera and Aranaea), and two abundant taxa
   characteristic of pasture (Orthoptera and Dermaptera). In contrast, most
   of the less abundant orders followed the opposite pattern, and were
   caught in higher numbers (and as a higher proportion of the total catch)
   in ungrazed woodland. Ungrazed woodland had a more diverse ground
   invertebrate fauna, most likely due to the greater diversity of food and
   habitat resources provided by the less disturbed vegetation. The
   differences in invertebrate communities corresponded to differences in
   vegetation and litter layers. The reduction in biodiversity of remnants
   due to grazing has implications for conservation management of remnant
   woodland in agricultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity of European floodplains is seriously threatened mainly due
   to (1) modifications of river courses such as channelisation or
   embankments, and (2) changes in traditional agricultural practices (i.e.

   fertilisation. A upstream-downstream survey of the Saone floodplain
   (France) has been done to identify the contribution of habitats to the
   floodplain biodiversity. Selected taxa were aquatic and terrestrial
   vegetation, Odonata, Coleoptera, Amphibians, and birds. The taxa were
   sampled in different habitat types that were: forests, grasslands and
   aquatic habitats. Tributary confluences with the river and cut-off
   channels contributed greatly to the floodplain diversity according to
   their invertebrates and aquatic vegetation communities. The abundance of
   rare species (benefitting of a national or regional protection status)
   was the highest in hygrophilous grasslands. Moreover, we demonstrated
   that diversity of breeding bird communities was correlated with the size
   of these habitats. We demonstrated also that alluvial forests
   contributed to maintain some particular species as Middle-spotted
   Woodpecker (Dendrocopus medius), while new plantations were colonized by
   openland bird communities sensible to the edge effect. Grassland
   fragmentation for agriculture appeared to be a major cause in
   biodiversity loss. Any alteration of the floodplain dynamics must be

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Only a small proportion of land can realistically be protected as nature
   reserves and thus conservation efforts also must focus on the ecological
   value of agroecosystems and developed areas surrounding nature reserves.
   In this study, avian communities were surveyed in 11 habitat types in
   central Panama, across a gradient from extensive forest to intensive
   agricultural land uses, to examine patterns of species richness and
   abundance and community composition. Wooded habitats, including
   extensive and fragmented forests, shade coffer plantations, and
   residential areas supported the most species and individuals.
   Nearctic-Neotropical migratory species were most numerous in lowland
   forest fragments, shade coffee, and residential areas. Introduced Pinus
   caribbea and sugar cane plantations supported the fewest species
   compared to all other habitats. Cattle pastures left fallow for less
   than two years supported more than twice as many total species as
   actively grazed pastures, such that species richness in fallow pastures
   was similar to that found in wooded habitats. Community similarities
   were relatively low among all habitat types (none exceeding the observed
   65\% similarity between extensive and fragmented lowland forests), bur
   communities in shade coffee and residential areas were 43\% and 54\%
   similar to lowland forest fragments, respectively. Fallow pastures and
   residential areas shared 60\% of their species. Bird communities in
   shade coffee and residential areas were characterized by higher
   proportions of frugivorous and nectarivorous species than in native
   forests. These same guilds also were better represented in fallow than
   in grazed pastures. Raptors and piscivorous species were most prevalent
   in cattle pastures and rice fields. These results, though based upon
   only species richness and abundance, demonstrate that many human-altered
   habitats have potential ecological value for birds, and conservation
   efforts in tropical areas should focus greater attention on enhancement
   of agricultural and developed lands as wildlife habitat. To understand
   the true conservation value of these modified lands will require
   examination not only of numbers but also of the types of species
   supported by these habitats, their reproductive output and survival
   rates.}},

   implications for ruminant livestock systems}},
Journal = {{GRASS AND FORAGE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{99-115}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Data on total, seasonal and between-year variability in the productivity
   and nutritional quality of cut forages obtained from a range of lowland
   semi-natural grasslands are reviewed.
   Dry-matter production, as hay, from unfertilized species-rich
   semi-natural grasslands ranged from less than 20\% to about 80\% of the
   production that might be expected from agriculturally improved and
   intensively managed grasslands. Unfertilized species-rich grasslands had
   lower growth rates, reflecting low nutrient availability in spring and
   early summer. Low soil phosphorus availability appears to be a key
   factor allowing high species-richness to be maintained.
   The in vitro digestibilities of herbage cut for hay from semi-natural
   grasslands were 20\%, or more, below values for conserved forages from
   intensively managed grassland. When losses incurred during the
   hay-making process were taken into account, then the nitrogen content of
   hays from many semi-natural grasslands appear to be sub-optimal for
   productive livestock. Metabolizable energy values of herbage cut for hay
   were 10-40\% below values for intensively managed conserved grass.
   Phosphorus content of forages from most species-rich grasslands was
   either below the metabolic requirement of livestock or inadequate to
   sustain high individual animal performance. Potential problems
   associated with supplementation of the diet with phosphorus, and with
   high calcium-to-phosphorus ratios, are discussed. Although potassium
   content of most of the herbage cut for hay was adequate for productive
   ruminant livestock, exceptions arise with hay cut after July. The
   magnesium content of cut herbage from some semi-natural grasslands was
   below an adequate level for productive livestock. Most cut herbage
   appeared to contain adequate amounts of sodium. Inadequacy of the
   mineral content of hays from semi-natural grasslands for ruminant
   livestock will be exacerbated by nutrient losses incurred during the
   hay-making process and particularly so when haymaking is prolonged by
   wet weather.
   Few feeding studies using hays from semi-natural grasslands of high
   nature conservation interest have been conducted. Lack of such data
   makes it difficult to plan any integrated use of these hays in ruminant
   feed budgets for livestock systems.}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{1. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that (i) abundance and
   related demographic parameters of small mammal populations would decline
   after clear-cutting of northern spruce-fir forest, and (ii) prescribed
   burning, following clearcutting, an approach to emulating natural
   disturbance, would enhance the species richness and diversity of the
   small mammal community relative to unharvested and clearcut forests.
   2. Intensive live-trapping of small mammal populations was conducted in
   replicated forest (uncut), clearcut and clearcut-burned sites from 1988
   to 1992 in west-central British Columbia, Canada.
   3. Mean abundance of southern red-backed voles Clethrionomys gapperi was
   significantly higher on forest sites (11.74 ha(-1)) than on clearcut
   (0.60 ha(-1)) or clearcut-burned (0.02 ha(-1)) sites. Mean numbers of
   deer mice Peromyscus maniculatus were significantly higher on the
   clearcut-burned sites (16.88 ha(-1)) than on forest sites (9.04 ha(-1)).
   Demographic parameters of reproduction, survival and body weight of deer
   mice were similar across all sites.
   4. The long-tailed vole Microtus longicaudus had a strong annual
   fluctuation in abundance, particularly on clearcut sites (14.04 ha(-1)),
   where there were significantly more animals than on either forest (1.53
   ha(-1)) or clearcut-burned (2.67 ha(-1)) sites. Meadow voles M.
   pennsylvanicus were relatively uncommon but occurred more often on
   clearcut and clearcut-burned sites than on forest sites.
   5. The north-western chipmunk Tamias amoenus occurred at significantly
   higher numbers on clearcut (4.16 ha(-1)) and clearcut-burned (3.88
   ha(-1)) sites than on forest sites, where it was rarely captured. Shrews
   Sorer spp. were at similar numbers across forest, clearcut and
   clearcut-burned sites. Weasels Mustela spp. were captured more often on
   clearcut and clearcut-burned sites than on forest sites. A rare species,
   the western jumping mouse Zapus princeps, was captured on clearcut and
   clearcut-burned sites only.
   6. Mean species richness of small mammals was significantly higher on
   clearcut sites (3.51) than on forest (2.73) or clearcut-burned (2.72)
   sites. Species diversity was similar over all sites. Although species
   composition was altered by clearcutting, abundance of all species,
   except C. gapperi, was the same or higher than that in uncut forest.
   7, Prescribed burning of clearcuts may not be necessary to mimic natural
   disturbance regimes. Clearcutting of northern spruce-fir forest may
   provide diverse habitats for small mammals through different stages of
   succession (along with old growth forest) much as wildfires formerly
   did.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{36}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. The patterns of arthropod diversity were investigated in 24 montane
   wetlands in Switzerland. These differed in altitude, management regime
   (cattle-grazing vs. mowing), vegetation structure (index combining
   vegetation height and density) and degree of habitat fragmentation.
   2, The general arthropod diversity was determined by net sampling at 10
   sampling points per site. The diversity of grasshoppers and butterflies
   was measured by counting species richness at the site and species
   density (species richness per unit area) on transects. The species
   richness of grasshoppers and butterflies was found to be more sensitive
   to the geographical attributes of the site whereas species density was
   more affected by the habitat quality.
   3. Grasshopper diversity decreased within the observed altitudinal range
   (800-1400 m) and was higher at grazed sites, whereas butterfly diversity
   was higher at mown sites. Arthropod diversity but not abundance of
   arthropods was positively related to the vegetation structure.
   4. The species richness of butterflies was negatively influenced by the
   degree of habitat fragmentation: both the size of habitat as well as the
   area of wetland habitats within 4 km were related positively to the
   number of specialist wetland butterflies.
   5. Late mowing as well as low-density cattle-grazing are appropriate
   management actions to maintain arthropod diversity in montane wetlands.
   In order to establish site-specific management plans? the biology of the
   present target species as well as the historical context should be

Title = {{The conservation management of Imperata cylindrica grassland in Nepal
   with fire and cutting: an experimental approach}},

Abstract = {{1. Imperata cylindrica dominated grassland in the Nepal Teral supports a
   number of threatened species including swamp deer Cervus duvauceli,
   hispid hare Caprolagus hispidus and Bengal florican Eupodotis
   bengalensis. It is also the main source of thatch material for local
   communities. Current widespread cutting and burning of the grasslands is
   deleterious to cover-dependent vertebrates which would benefit from
   patches of grassland remaining unmanaged.
   2. In Royal Bardia National Park, a randomized block experiment with
   four treatments (cutting, burning, cutting and burning, and no
   management) was established to examine the effects of these treatments
   on plant species abundance, species richness and grassland structure.
   The grassland was dominated by Imperata cylindrica, with Saccharum
   spontaneum, Vetiveria zizanioides, Desmostachya bipinnata and
   Schizachytrium brevifolium the other abundant species.
   3. In year 3, 2 years after the first treatment, Imperata cylindrica
   remained the dominant grass species under all treatments. It increased
   in abundance in unmanaged plots and declined in abundance in managed
   plots. Desmostachya bipinnata showed the opposite response. Plant
   species richness was significantly higher in managed plots, which were
   structurally more heterogeneous.
   4. The effects of cutting alone, burning alone, and cutting and burning
   combined on the structure and composition of the grassland were similar,
   despite additive effects on total grass cover, total forb cover and forb
   species richness in cut and burned plots. This allows the effects of
   cutting and burning to be reduced to a single treatment (cutting and
   burning) in future experiments to investigate the impacts of patch
   harvesting on community dynamics. Simpler factorial experiments can be
   designed than if cutting and burning had to be considered as separate
   treatments.
   5. There was no difference in the establishment of tall grass species or
   woody species between managed and unmanaged plots.
   6. Results suggest that patches of grassland could be left unmanaged on
   a 2-year rotation without significantly altering the composition of the
   plant community, thereby providing refugia for cover-dependent faunal
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty three camel calves (1.5-3.0 years) we re divided into 2 groups.
   Group 1 of 6 camel calves (3 males, 3 females) was stall-fed on ad
   libitum ration of dry groundnut (Arachis hypogea) guna/chara while group
   II of 17 camel calves (10 males and 7 females) sent for grazing in
   3-tier silvi-pasture for 7 hours a day. The average daily gain (g/d) was
   significantly (p<0.01) higher in group (0.427+/-0.03) than in group II
   (0.237+/-0.03). The nutritive value of groundnut guna was 2.89\% DCP and
   8.72 MJME/kg DM and that of groundnut chara was 3.78\% DCP and 8.60
   MJME/kg DM in stall-fed group. Both Groundnut guna and chara had low Ca
   contents and thus its GIT absorption was less (-27.74 and -0.97\%).
   Plant vigour and chemical composition of groundnut crop at different
   growth stages revealed continuous increase in per cent units of DM
   (11.67), CF (4.00) and NFE (4.39) with concomitant decrease in per cent
   units of CP (6.36), EE (1.88) and P(0.17). The annual sustainability of
   groundnut crop from 11.25 hectares was worked out to be 0.35 ACU (adult
   camel unit of 500 kg body weight). Cultivation of groundnut crop
   resulted in depletion of soil nutrients of available phosphate (29.69\%)
   and potash (20.75\%) but increase in per cent carbon (+454.90\%). Plant
   biodiversity of 3-tier system consisted of 51.4\% edible and 48.6\%
   non-edible species besides ground cover of various grass species. The
   results indicated that although growth was higher in stall feeding
   system, better camel growth can be achieved from 3-tier system by way of
   plant biomass enrichment through introduction of better bushes/shrubs,
   trees, grasses and supplementation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{75-84}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing concern about the conservation of dung beetles which
   are threatened by several peculiar dangers worldwide, both at the
   population and community level. A noticeable threat in Europe is the
   dramatic reduction in the number of cattle and sheep grazing in the
   open, which is associated with both intensive agriculture and the
   progressive reforestation of previously pastured areas. We studied dung
   beetle habitat and resource preferences at La Mandria Park (north-west
   Italy) which is a mosaic of open and wooded patches where domestic (cows
   and horses) and wild ungulates (deer and wild boar) co-exist.
   Scarabaeidae were numerically dominant, accounting for 61.5\% of the
   approximately 3000 individuals sampled (Aphodiidae accounted for 32.5\%
   and Geotrupidae for only 6\%). However, when species richness was
   considered, Aphodiidae were dominant, with 17 of the 27 species found
   (Scarabaeidae with eight and Geotrupidae with two). Assuming a null
   hypothesis of equal probability of colonizing any habitat or faeces, we
   found that most species were significantly associated with one of the
   four dung types or with one of the two habitats considered. On average,
   Scarabaeidae preferred cattle dung and open habitats whereas most
   Aphodiidae used deer lumps and wooded habitats. In spite of the precise
   ecological choices observed at La Mandria, surveys from other European
   areas suggest that both habitat and food selection are quite flexible.
   From a conservation viewpoint, the ability of coprophagous beetles to
   choose herbivore faeces according to their availability and to select
   habitats that satisfy their own microclimate requirements may certainly
   be useful in preserving biodiversity. Agroecology, which implies some
   woodland and hedgerow management practices associated with pastoralism,
   could be the right approach to the management of the agricultural
   landscape. Conversely, in reforested areas, while wild ungulate
   populations should be preserved, some form of human disturbance,
   particularly clearings used for pastoralism, should also be maintained.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{61-70}},

Abstract = {{. Common reed (Phragmites australis Trin.) has spread in fen meadows on
   the Swiss Plateau during the last decades. An increased dominance of
   this tall grass may reduce the plant species richness and displace rare
   or endangered species because of the additional shade. To investigate
   whether this has actually happened and whether shading by Phragmites was
   likely to be responsible for the reduction, the plant species
   composition was surveyed in 241 plots (4 m2) with differing above-ground
   biomass of Phragmites (ABP). Species richness and the occurrence of
   characteristic fen species were negatively related to site productivity
   (total above-ground biomass), but correlations with ABP were generally
   weaker. The main change associated with increasing ABP within
   species-rich fens (alliances Molinion and Caricion davallianae) was an
   increase of species characteristic of the more species-poor alliance
   Filipendulion. Thus, Phragmites did apparently not play a
   disproportionate role in the reduction of species richness in the plant
   communities studied. Selective clipping experiments and light
   measurements also indicated that shading by Phragmites does not have a
   strong effect upon the performance of other species in the community, at
   least in the short term. The reason appeared to lie in the later
   seasonal growth of Phragmites compared with the other species. These
   results suggest that the direct impact of shading by Phragmites on the
   species richness of fen meadows is probably lower than has been assumed.
   However, possible long-term or indirect effects still need to be
   investigated.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{. Sustainability is an important quality of the types of agriculture
   nowadays promoted in central Europe, notably biological agriculture and
   integrated production. Agronomists, decision-makers and the public
   generally assume that this agricultural sustainability implies the
   maintenance of species diversity. However, this assumption often does
   not hold true. This is shown in a case study of moderately ferti-lized
   Arrhenatheretum meadows in northern Switzerland. Earlier and more
   frequent mowing, simultaneous harvesting of all the grasslands in a
   region, and ecological changes in surrounding arable fields, hedges and
   other ecosystems often cause a decline in plant and animal species
   richness, while agricultural yield does not noticeably change. To
   emphasize the distinction the concept of biocenotic sustainability is
   proposed for describing the capability of a community to maintain its
   species composition and structure. For maintaining or attaining
   biocenotic sustainability. results of modern ecology have to be taken
   into account, e.g. the theories of island biogeography, minimum viable
   populations, dispersal, and metapopulations. There is evidence that
   biocenotic sustainability always implies sustainability of agricultural
   yield.}},

   its density is positively correlated with grazing intensity. There are
   two assemblages of grassland bird species that appear to be indicative

Abstract = {{This paper argues that, at present, ecotourism can contribute to
   safeguard biodiversity and ecosystem functions in developing countries,
   even though meeting the requirements for ecotourism is extremely
   difficult. A cost-benefit analysis of those ecosystems richest in
   species diversity, i.e. tropical rainforests, leads to the conclusion
   that non-use values often outweigh the values of conventional uses
   (clear-cutting, pasture, etc.), but are hardly considered in development
   decisions. Therefore, tourism and its high direct use value can play an
   important role as an incentive for protection. As tourism causes
   significant emissions, e.g. by flying, the concept of Environmental
   Damage Costs is introduced and integrated into the calculations.
   Further, international tourism development is analyzed and related to
   protection goals. Visitation rates of sensitive areas need to be
   limited; education, management, and control measures have to be
   integrated; and the proportion of money captured from tourists has to be
   increased. In the long run, tourism needs to undergo substantial
   changes. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Savanna woodlands and their associated species diversity and endemism
   are widely seen as declining through human impacts. Alternative views
   suggest that savanna ecosystems vary with a large number of biophysical
   factors, among which human impacts may be of relatively minor
   importance. This paper examines the debate with respect to Mkomazi Game
   Reserve in Northern Tanzania, where biodiversity has been inventoried
   and local resource use studied. It sets out the history of land use in
   Mkomazi and examines the available data on the area's plant, bird and
   invertebrate diversity. Comparative analysis is complicated by the
   paucity of data for other savannas in the same biogeographic zone, and
   by differences in sampling effort and methodology. Conservation
   literature and Tanzanian government documents present Mkomazi as one of
   the richest savannas in Africa, as a centre of endemism: and as
   threatened by deleterious impacts of human land use. Available data do
   not substantiate such statements. The paper examines implications of
   those perceptions for management, particularly eviction of resident
   pastoralists from the Reserve in 1988, and subsequent exclusion of
   reserve-adjacent dwellers. Conservation relies increasingly on
   reserve-adjacent people, and on prioritizing the allocation of scarce
   resources. There is an ur ent need for rigorous studies of the
   implications of human land use in savannas, for better data on
   biodiversity, and for rigorous standards in the way those data are
   applied.}},

Abstract = {{We aimed to explore the farm scale effects of three landuse types,
   communal grazing, wildlife management and commercial cattle farming, on
   the woody vegetation of a semiarid savanna.
   Location The study farms were located within a single bioclimatic zone
   in semiarid savanna, South Africa.
   Methods The species composition and structure of woody vegetation on
   three farms of each of three landuse types were sampled.
   Results We found that communal grazing land sites were classified
   outside the topland-bottomland vegetation dichotomy characteristic of
   this region. Comparisons of size class distributions showed the communal
   grazing lands had fewer small and large individuals; suggesting both
   lower levels of regeneration and regenerative capacity in the communal
   grazing lands. The species richness and biomass of woody plants was
   lower on communal grazing lands than on private game reserves and
   commercial cattle farms. The longevity of tree species explains the
   observed lag between changes in abundance and species loss; we
   consequently predict that there will be future losses of species in the
   communal grazing lands. By classifying species into a range of
   use-categories we showed that utilization and species loss was not
   limited to certain plant use categories. Higher levels of wood
   harvesting measured in the communal grazing lands are likely to be
   responsible for the observed differences.
   Main conclusions It is concluded that communal grazing management at
   this study site has substantially changed the composition and structure
   of woody plant communities, and that these changes have reduced the
   current availability of natural resources and will reduce resource
   production in the future.}},

Abstract = {{A 10-year riparian grazing study was conducted on a cold, mountain
   meadow riparian system in central Idaho in response to cattle
   grazing-salmonid fisheries conflicts. Six pastures were established
   along Stanley Creek to study the effects on riparian habitat of no
   grazing, light grazing (20-25\% utilization), and medium grazing
   (35-50\%) during late June. Stream channels narrowed, stream width-depth
   ratios were reduced, and channel bottom embeddedness decreased under all
   3 grazing treatments as the area responded to changes from heavier
   historic grazing use. Streambank stability increased and streamside
   willow communities (Salix spp. L.) increased in both height and cover
   under all 3 treatments. Plant species richness increased on both
   streamside and dry meadow areas during the years of grazing and moderate
   drought. The numbers of species receded to near original levels in the
   ungrazed and light grazed pastures in 1996, a wet post-grazing year,
   primarily due to a decrease in forb species. Streamside graminoid height
   growth was similar among treatments after 1 year of rest. Most
   measurements of streamside variables moved closer to those beneficial
   for salmonid fisheries when pastures were grazed to 10 cm of graminoid
   stubble height; virtually all measurements improved when pastures were
   grazed to 14 cm stubble height, or when pastures were not grazed. Many
   improvements were similar under all 3 treatments indicating these
   riparian habitats are compatible with light to medium late spring use by
   cattle.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed vegetation surveys were made at three East Sussex ancient chalk
   grassland sites, and soil nutrient and light levels were compared within
   and outside dominant stands of tor grass Brachypodium pinnatum. The
   presence of B. pinnatum had a detrimental effect on species diversity
   with forbs most sensitive to its dominance, followed by cryptogams and
   graminoids. Within each group, low growing species were generally most
   vulnerable to high B, pinnatum cover but certain species, typical of
   more productive habitats, were able to persist. Although the general
   response in the three communities was similar, there were important
   differences, with forb diversity affected less, and coarse grasses
   reaching higher cover values under B. pinnatum at a previously
   under-grazed site than at the other two sites. The levels of soil
   nitrate, but not other nutrients, were significantly higher under B.
   pinnatum stands than under the surrounding community. This may have
   significant implications for the control of B. pinnatum, as elevated

Abstract = {{In many species-rich hay meadows in Central Europe, the traditional
   extensive (low input, low output) management is no longer economical and
   meadows are either fertilized or abandoned. Both these practices lead to
   changes in species composition and usually to a loss in species
   diversity. The response of a species-rich meadow plant community to
   fertilization, mowing and removal of dominant species was studied in a
   manipulative factorial experiment over four years. Both species richness
   and seedling recruitment were positively influenced by mowing and to a
   lesser extent by removal of the dominant species, Molinia caerulea, and
   were negatively influenced by fertilization. Fertilization caused an
   immediate increase in community biomass. Response to removal of the
   dominant species was delayed by one season, continued over the whole
   period, and by the fourth year the biomass reached a similar value as in
   the plots with Molinia present. Changes in species composition were
   evaluated by RDA for repeated measurements. The best and only
   significant predictor of species response to fertilization was plant
   height. This shows that with increased nutrient availability, nutrient
   limitation weakens and competition for light becomes the decisive
   factor. Competition for light appears to be more asymmetric than
   competition for nutrients, and consequently, it is more likely to drive
   inferior species to extinction. This is, together with seedling
   recruitment limitations, the most important cause of a decrease in
   species richness under high nutrient levels.}},

Abstract = {{The landscape history of the largest calcareous seminatural alvar site
   (ca. 700 ha) in Estonia, is described with the help of a historical map
   from 1705 and aerial photographs from 1951, and recent vegetation
   mapping from 1991-1996. The seminatural, species rich alvar grasslands
   originate and are maintained by grazing of domestic animals. Three
   hundred years ago the area was mainly open grassland with sparse shrubs
   and some fields. Forty years ago the vegetation pattern was similar,
   with some smaller forests and forest clear-cut areas present. Now, since
   grazing has ceased for ca. 40 years, only 30\% of the area remains as
   open grassland and 70\% as forest. Identification of clusters of field
   layer vegetation using the program TABORD resulted in 8 clusters, which
   agreed with the empirically determined community types. The field layer
   within the young pine forest (up to 20 year old pines) is similar to the
   open alvar grassland. In older forests, the field layer has already
   changed. There were no phytosociological differences found between
   ancient grasslands and grasslands on former arable fields or forest
   clear-cut areas. Decrease in species richness, compared to open
   grassland. was most drastic in forests of age 20-40 years where the
   canopy was most closed. Forests have spread more extensively in areas
   with deeper soil. The continuation of traditional management (grazing
   and tree cutting) in alvar grasslands is urgently needed in order to
   keep seminatural alvar grasslands open. The possibility to restore open
   grasslands remains as long as there is a pool of grassland species
   available, especially in younger forests.}},

Abstract = {{Sub-alpine, semi-natural grasslands induced by mountain summer farming
   in Budalen, central Norway, can be divided into two main habitats: small
   enclosures at each summer farm site, and the pastures surrounding them.
   Enclosures are exposed to different land-use regimes including grazing,
   mowing, fertilisation and soil disturbance. Pastures have never been
   fertilised or ploughed and the current grazing pressure is moderate. All
   investigated pastures are former haymaking areas. Higher conservation
   values of pastures compared to enclosures is reflected both in patterns
   of species richness and the occurrence of vulnerable species. Higher
   species richness in pastures is related to lower nutrient levels, lower
   loss of ignition in the soil, and higher levels of pH. Vulnerable
   species are concentrated in species-rich pastures, and have tow local
   abundance and regional distribution. Enclosures reflect a complexity in
   land-use, were the effects of mowing, fertilising and ploughing on plant
   community patterns could not be separated. Tree and shrub species are
   common in both habitats, and indicate a successional invasion of woody
   species. Maintenance of land-uses that have created semi-natural
   grasslands in the long term perspective (grazing, cutting of trees and
   shrubs, and mowing) is necessary to prevent forest succession, and a
   prerequisite for future conservation of sub-alpine, semi-natural
   grasslands. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Species richness of six pasture arthropod assemblages (total arthropod
   species, total herbivore species, sucking and chewing herbivores, total
   predatory species and spiders) were regressed against several
   geographical variables (area, distance fern thc nearest mainland,
   maximum elevation and geological age of the islands) of three Azorean
   islands (S. Maria, Terceira and Pico). The species were sampled by the
   fixed-quadrat size sampling method and the results obtained are
   consistent with the geological age hypothesis, i.e. the species richness
   of the six indigenous arthropod assemblages increases with the
   geological age of the islands, both at local and regional scales. Higher
   values of indigenous and endemic species richness were consistently
   found on the older island (S. Maria), and the lowest values on die most
   recent island (Pico). Moreover, when considering the age of Faial (an
   older island probably once connected with Pico) as a estimate of the age
   of Pico, correlations between species richness and island age were
   improved: thereby strengthening the relationship. The older island (S.
   Maria) has more specialized herbivores and a greater proportion of
   herbivores in relation to predatory arthropods. Ecological and
   biogeographical studies in the Azores should take into account the
   effects of the time each island has been available for colonization and

Abstract = {{Floristic differences between cattle-grazed and macropod-grazed sites

   While macropod-grazed sites have had a lower incidence of fire than the

   the major differences between these treatments. One dominant
   (Capillipedium parviflorum) and another common (Sehima nervosa) native
   perennial grass in the macropod-grazed treatment were not recorded
   within the cattle-grazed treatment. There was generally a lower species
   richness and Shannon-Weaver diversity of perennial forbs in the
   cattle-grazed treatment compared to the macropod-grazed treatment. There
   was higher richness, diversity, and abundance of annual grasses in the
   cattle-grazed treatment compared to the macropod-grazed treatment. The

Abstract = {{Free-ranging large grazers, such as cattle and horses, are increasingly
   reintroduced to former agricultural areas in Western Europe in order to
   restore natural and diverse habitats. In this review we outline
   mechanisms by which large grazers induce and maintain structural
   diversity in the vegetation (mosaics of grasslands, shrub thickets and
   trees). This variation in vegetation structure is considered to be
   important for the conservation of biodiversity of various plant and
   animal groups. The process of spatial association with unpalatable
   plants (associational resistance) enables palatable plants to establish
   in grasslands maintained by large grazers. In this way, short
   unattractive (thorny, low quality or toxic) species facilitate taller
   unattractive shrubs, which facilitate palatable trees, which in turn
   outshade the species that facilitated their recruitment. Established
   trees can, therefore, not regenerate under their own canopy, leading to
   cyclic patch dynamics. Since this cyclic dynamic occurs on a local
   scale, this contributes to shifting mosaics. The mechanisms involved in
   creating and maintaining the resulting shifting mosaics are described
   for temperate floodplain and heathland ecosystems, including the effects
   on nutrient transport within grazed landscapes. How grazing leads to
   shifting mosaics is described in terms of plant functional types,
   allowing potential generalisation to other ecosystems. The resulting
   interaction web of grasses, unpalatable forbs and shrubs, palatable
   light-demanding trees and shade-tolerant trees is discussed, and was
   found to contain various interesting direct and indirect effects. The
   key process contributing to spatial diversity in vegetation structure is
   the alternation of positive (facilitation) interactions between plant
   species at one life cycle stage, and competitive displacement at another
   stage. Crazing thus causes directional successional sequences to change
   to shifting mosaics. The implications of this theory for nature
   conservation are discussed, including the relevant management problems,
   possible choices and practical solutions. We conclude that the
   theoretical framework outlined in this review provides helpful insights
   when coping with nature conservation issues in temperate woodland
   habitats.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{We used multiscale plots to sample vascular plant diversity and soil
   characteristics in and adjacent to 26 long-term grazing exclosure sites
   in Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, and South Dakota, USA. The exclosures
   were 7-60 yr old (31.2 +/- 2.5 yr, mean +/- 1 SE). Plots were also
   randomly placed in the broader landscape in open rangeland in the same
   vegetation type at each site to assess spatial variation in grazed
   landscapes. Consistent sampling in the nine National Parks, Wildlife
   Refuges, and other management units yielded data from 78 1000-m(2) plots
   and 780 1-m(2) subplots. We hypothesized that native species richness
   would be lower in the exclosures than in grazed sites, due to
   competitive exclusion in the absence of grazing. We also hypothesized
   that grazed sites would have higher native and exotic species richness
   compared to ungrazed areas, due to disturbance (i.e., the
   intermediate-disturbance hypothesis) and the conventional wisdom that
   grazing may accelerate weed invasion. Both hypotheses were soundly
   rejected. Although native species richness in l-mz subplots was
   significantly higher (P < 0.05) in grazed sites, we found nearly
   identical native or exotic species richness in 1000-m(2) plots in
   exclosures (31.5 +/- 2.5 native and 3.1 +/- 0.5 exotic species),
   adjacent grazed plots (32.6 +/- 2.8 native and 3.2 +/- 0.6 exotic
   species), and randomly selected grazed plots (31.6 +/- 2.9 native and
   3.2 +/- 0.6 exotic species). We found no significant differences in
   species diversity (Hill's diversity indices, N1 and N2), evenness
   (Hill's ratio of evenness, E5), cover of various life-forms (grasses,
   forbs, and shrubs), soil texture, or soil percentage of N and C between
   grazed and ungrazed sites at the 1000-m(2) plot scale. The species lists
   of the long-ungrazed and adjacent grazed plots overlapped just 57.9 +/-
   2.8\%. This difference in species composition is commonly attributed
   solely to the difference in grazing regimes. However, the species lists
   between pairs of grazed plots (adjacent and distant 1000-m(2) plots) in
   the same vegetation type overlapped just 48.6 +/- 3.6\%, and the
   ungrazed plots and distant grazed plots overlapped 49.4 +/- 3.6\%.
   Differences in vegetation and soils between grazed and ungrazed sites
   were minimal in most cases, but soil characteristics and elevation were
   strongly correlated with native and exotic plant diversity in the study
   region. For the 78 1000-m(2) plots, 59.4\% of the variance in total
   species richness was explained by percentage of silt (coefficient =
   0.647, t = 5.107, P < 0.001), elevation (coefficient = 0.012, t = 5.084,
   P < 0.001), and total foliar cover (coefficient = 0.110, t = 2.104, P <
   0.039). Only 12.8\% of the variance in exotic species cover
   (log(10)cover) was explained by percentage of clay (coefficient =
   -0.011, t = -2.878, P < 0.005), native species richness (coefficient =
   -0.011, t = -2.156, P < 0.034), and log(10)N (coefficient = 2.827, t =
   1.860, P < 0.067). Native species cover and exotic species richness and
   frequency were also significantly positively correlated with percentage
   of soil N at the 1000-m(2) plot scale.
   Our research led to five broad generalizations about current levels of
   grazing in these Rocky Mountain grasslands: (1) grazing probably has
   little effect on native species richness at landscape scales; (2)
   grazing probably has little effect on the accelerated spread of most
   exotic plant species at landscape scales; (3) grazing affects local
   plant species and life-form composition and cover, but spatial variation
   is considerable; (4) soil characteristics, climate, and disturbances may
   have a greater effect on plant species diversity than do current levels
   of grazing; and (5) few plant species show consistent, directional
   responses to grazing or cessation of grazing.}},

Volume = {{69}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Some theories and experimental studies suggest that areas of low plant
   species richness may be invaded more easily than areas of high plant
   species richness. We gathered nested-scale vegetation data on plant
   species richness, foliar cover, and frequency from 200 1-m(2) subplots
   (20 1000-m(2) modified-Whittaker plots) in the Colorado Rockies (USA),
   and 160 1-m(2) subplots (16 1000-m(2) plots) in the Central Grasslands
   in Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and Minnesota (USA) to test the
   generality of this paradigm.
   At the 1-m(2) scale, the paradigm was supported in four prairie types in
   the Central Grasslands, where exotic species richness declined with
   increasing plant species richness and cover. At the I-m: scale, five
   forest and meadow vegetation types in the Colorado Rockies contradicted
   the paradigm; exotic species richness increased with native-plant
   species richness and foliar cover. At the 1000-m(2) plot scale (among
   vegetation types), 83\% of the variance in exotic species richness in
   the Central Grasslands was explained by the total percentage of nitrogen
   in the soil and the cover of native plant species. In the Colorado
   Rockies, 69\% of the variance in exotic species richness in 1000-m(2)
   plots was explained by the number of native plant species and the total
   percentage of soil carbon.
   At landscape and biome scales, exotic species primarily invaded areas of
   high species richness in the four Central Grasslands sites and in the
   five Colorado Rockies vegetation types. For the nine vegetation types in
   both biomes, exotic species cover was positively correlated with mean
   foliar cover, mean soil percentage N, and the total number of exotic
   species. These patterns of invasibility depend on spatial scale, biome
   and vegetation type, spatial autocorrelation effects, availability of
   resources, and species-specific responses to grazing and other
   disturbances. We conclude that: (1) sites high in herbaceous foliar
   cover and soil fertility, and hot spots of plant diversity land
   biodiversity), are invasible in many landscapes; and (2) this pattern
   may be more closely related to the degree resources are available in
   native plant communities, independent of species richness. Exotic plant
   invasions in rare habitats and distinctive plant communities pose a
   significant challenge to land managers and conservation biologists.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the vegetation composition of a remnant Themeda triandra
   Forsskal grassland in southeastern Australia were documented following
   the replacement of stock grazing with intermittent burning at 3-11-year
   intervals. The vegetation was initially sampled in 1986, 1 year after
   stock were removed, and then 10 years later in 1996. Most frequently
   encountered grassland species were abundant in both surveys, although
   there was little correspondence between species richness at the quadrat
   scale in 1986 and 1996. Total floristic richness increased slightly over
   the 10-year period, owing to the proliferation of tall forbs with
   wind-blown seeds, including exotic thistles and colonising native forbs.
   Unfortunately, most native `increasers' were `weedy' species which are
   not typical or common components of species-rich temperate grassland
   remnants in southern Victoria. Thus, replacing grazing with intermittent
   burning has not resulted in the flora becoming more similar to that of
   high-quality, species-rich grassland remnants, but instead, has promoted
   a group of ruderal colonisers. The ability to identify factors
   contributing to particular botanical changes was hampered by the design
   of the management regimes implemented over the past decade. Suggestions
   are provided to overcome these difficulties, incorporating principles

   plant and vegetation change resulting from disturbance or restoration
   efforts. Ant community composition, relative abundances of species, and
   species richness were the same on disturbed and undisturbed sites. None
   of the metrics based on hypothesized responses of ants to disturbance
   clearly distinguished between disturbed and undisturbed sites. Ant
   communities on sites where restoration efforts have resulted in distinct
   differences in vegetative cover and composition were similar to the ant
   communities on degraded unrehabilitated sites on the same soil type. Ant
   communities in riparian cottonwood gallery forests in Arizona and New
   Mexico were similar but differed from the assemblages in exotic salt
   cedar and native ash riparian woodlands. Ant species exhibited
   remarkable resistance to human-induced disturbances in these rangeland
   areas. In grasslands dominated by the South African grass, Eragrostis
   lehmanniana Nees, large seed harvesting ants, Pogonomyrmex spp., were
   greatly reduced in abundance compared to native grasslands. Other ant

   significantly at elevated CO2 in the 2nd (+20\%, P = 0.05), 3rd (+21\%,
   P = 0.02) and 4th years (+29\%, P = 0.02). There were no detectable
   differences in root biomass in the top 8 cm of soil between CO2
   treatments on eight out of nine sampling dates. There were significant
   differences in CO2 responsiveness between functional groups (legumes,
   non-leguminous forbs, graminoids) in the 2nd (P = 0.07) and 3rd (P <
   0.001) years of the study. The order of CO2 responsiveness among
   functional groups changed substantially from the 2nd to the 3rd year;
   for example, non-leguminous forbs had the smallest relative response in
   the 2nd year and the largest in the 3rd year. By the 3rd year of CO2
   exposure, large species-specific differences in CO2 response had
   developed. For five important species or genera the order of
   responsiveness was Lotus corniculatus (+271\%), Carex flacca (+249\%),
   Bromus erectus (+ 33\%), Sanguisorba minor (no significant CO2 effect),
   and six Trifolium species (a negative response that was not
   significant). The positive CO2 responses in Bromus and Carex were most
   closely related to increases in tiller number. Species richness was not
   affected by CO2 treatment, but species evenness increased under elevated
   CO2 (modified Hill ratio; P = 0.03) in June of the 3rd year, resulting
   in a marginally significant increase in species diversity (Simpson's
   index; P = 0.09). This and other experiments with calcareous grassland
   plants show that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations can
   substantially alter the structure of calcareous grassland communities
   and may increase plant community biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Soil and vegetation development on surface-mined coal sites in a mixed
   grass prairie region were studied as (a) naturally revegetated
   chronosequences of 1, 7, 17, 30 and 45-year old sites, and (b) on sites
   that were regraded, received topsoil, and were fertilized and seeded. In
   both cases, vegetation and soils of adjacent, relatively undisturbed
   areas were also studied for comparison. Species richness was lowest (26
   species) at the 1-year old site and highest (114 species) at unmined
   sites; species richness increased youngest to the oldest sites. Stand
   ordinations revealed that the site age was the most important factor
   influencing species richness and abundance. On the younger sites, the
   environment was characterized by unleached parent materials high in
   electrical conductivity, SO4, Mg, Ca, and Na and plants growing there
   were non-native, annual pioneers. At about 30 years, the edaphic
   conditions had moderated somewhat, and the species complex had a greater
   number of native species. However, even after 45 years, there were clear
   differences among mined and unmined sites both in species composition
   and edaphic conditions. Rates of nutrient accumulations over the 45-year
   time gradient were as follows: organic C 131 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), N 25 kg
   ha(-1) yr(-1), P 0.1 kg ha(-1) yr(-)1, and K 4.9 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). C/N
   ratios showed the widest range for 1-year old sites (5-40), but 70\% of
   the 45-year old sites showed values below 15, comparable to unmined
   sites. Distributional diagrams of plant species revealed their
   topographic and habitat preferences which may be helpful in formulating
   species prescriptions for revegetation. Stand-environmental complex
   ordinations with 53 variables in the matrix showed topographic variables
   to be the most important, followed by site age. This study attempted to
   evaluate simultaneously two major environmental factors-time and
   topography, as these influence the development of soils and vegetation
   concomitantly. The use of canonical correspondence analysis facilitated
   the resolution of these two major environmental factors in illustrating
   the relationships between the species and the environments in which they
   grow. Simulations with the CENTURY model of C and N dynamics on north-
   and south-facing slopes provided useful insights into the recovery time
   of mined systems. All carbon pools (except passive) were larger on the
   north-facing slopes than on the south, as was the accumulation of
   organic N. Rehabilitation of mined areas is now required by law and
   regulations applicable in the region under discussion mandate the
   following steps: regrading of ridges to blend in with the surrounding
   topography, spreading topsoil, fertilizing and seeding. The course of
   vegetation and soil development of such sites was studied intensively
   for four years and revealed that the first year vegetation, irrespective
   of desirable species seeded, was dominated by the pioneer forb, Kochia
   scoparia. Its replacement by seeded grasses was quick. The rapid
   replacement of Kochia by grasses appears to be related to the production
   of allelochemics by Kochia and its acting as a nurse crop in the first
   year. Although allelochemics may be produced by Kochia as a defense
   mechanism for herbivory, the compounds seem to produce ionic imbalances
   (P, Mn, Zn) which hasten its own demise through autotoxicity. Like the
   abandoned mined sites, dispersal of seeds in space (immigration) seemed
   to be more important than from seeds in the topsoil (seed banks-
   dispersal in time).
   But in contrast to abandoned mined sites, the managed sites showed (a) a
   very rapid replacement of pioneers, (b) three to five times faster rates
   of leaching of ions capable of diminishing plant growth, (c) 5-8 times
   faster rates of mineralization of ions that promote growth, and (d)
   successional trends followed the facilitation and auto-inhibition
   pathways. A comparison of abandoned and managed systems clearly shows
   that by following the legal mandates, the rehabilitation process can be
   achieved many decades sooner with human assistance.}},

Title = {{Influence of landscape structure on kangaroo abundance in a disturbed

Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{1999}},
Volume = {{21}},

Pages = {{104-134}},
Abstract = {{This paper develops a hierarchical landscape approach for investigating
   how landscape structure influences the abundance of eastern grey
   kangaroos, red kangaroos and common wallaroos on properties in a
   partially cleared semi-arid woodland of Queensland. This approach is
   applied to examine the extent to which a mosaic of spatial factors at a
   hierarchy of scales influences kangaroo abundance at the property level,
   the level of management interest. The analysis concludes that the
   structure of the property habitat mosaic, coupled with pasture
   productivity, is the most important influence for each species. Access
   to water was not a limiting factor, although it may be important
   locally. Grey kangaroos prefer an even mosaic of all habitat types on
   properties with productive grass-dominated pastures. Red kangaroos are
   positively associated with run-on areas and large-shrub regrowth
   patches, reflecting their foraging preferences for forbs and short
   grasses and their ability to use more open habitats. Wallaroos have a
   clumped density distribution associated with a heterogeneous mosaic of
   open habitats interspersed with fragmented forest patches and small to
   medium-grained shrub-regrowth patches.
   The research, while not replicated, identifies linkages between tree
   clearing practices at the property level and increased large kangaroo
   abundance in the region. These linkages have been previously overlooked
   in the kangaroo management debate. Therefore, any tree clearing
   guidelines developed at the property level need to be sensitive to key
   ecological processes influencing kangaroo populations at both the
   landscape and property levels. If not, the sustainable management of
   total grazing pressure (livestock plus kangaroos) biodiversity
   conservation will never become a reality.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we quantify the density, cover and obstruction width of
   vegetation patches, the roughness of landscape surfaces, and the
   diversities of plants and grasshoppers with distance from cattle
   watering-points. We used distance from water as a surrogate for a
   gradient in grazing pressure. Fourteen study sites were located in the
   Victoria River District of northern Australia, seven from a water point
   on Kidman Springs Station on calcareous red loam soils and seven from a
   water point at Mount Sanford Station on cracking-clay black soils. At
   each study site transect lines were oriented within the landscape to run
   downslope (i.e. in the direction of flows of run-off). We measured the
   intercept length and obstruction width of perennial vegetation patches
   along these lines. Plant diversity was measured in quadrats positioned
   along each line and grasshopper diversity was determined by species
   counts on each site. We also surveyed the roughness of the landscape
   surface along each line. A rough surface will tend to slow run-off,
   hence increase time for water infiltration and soil-water storage.
   Surface roughness declined near water, as did the density, cover and
   obstruction width of perennial vegetation patches. Grasshopper and plant
   species richness also declined near water. These declines suggest strong
   linkages between landscape function, biodiversity and impacts of cattle
   grazing and trampling. Cattle will always create `sacrifice zones:
   around watering-points. However, the area of this impact on function and
   diversity can be minimised by managing the timing and intensity of
   paddock use.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural landscapes can be defined as mosaics of landscape elements
   which are affected by farming practices. Woodland habitats, even though
   they are managed, are amongst the most stable elements of agricultural
   landscapes and can play a key role in the maintenance of biodiversity.
   This study of the ground beetle (carabid) communities of woodlands and
   woody linear features in a Scottish agricultural landscape shows that
   these habitats contribute significantly to the overall landscape
   diversity of these beetles. Communities in woods and hedgerows display
   the same species diversity and are both characterized by the presence of
   forest species. The main factors constraining carabid communities in
   both environments are the grazing intensity and, to a lesser extent, the
   type of soil. Heavily grazed locations are characterized by the
   occurrence of grassland species while forest species are restricted to
   ungrazed locations. At the landscape scale, the distribution of the
   forest species is limited by spatial isolation, indicating that there
   are insufficient functional links between woodland habitats in the study
   area. Isolation could be compensated for either by a better control of
   grazing so that linear features can be used as dispersal corridors for
   forest carabids or by planting more linear features and woods in the
   area.}},

Abstract = {{To test the hypothesis that the impacts of grazers on plant species
   richness reverse under contrasting nutrient richness, we analyzed
   unpublished and published data from lake, stream, marine, grassland, and
   forest ecosystems. We analyzed data from 30 studies providing 44
   comparisons of plant species richness under low vs. high grazing
   pressure in enriched or nutrient-rich and non-enriched or nutrient-poor
   ecosystems. All 19 comparisons from non-enriched or nutrient-poor
   ecosystems exhibited significantly lower species richness under high
   grazing than under low grazing. In contrast, 14 of 25 comparisons from
   enriched or nutrient-rich ecosystems showed significantly higher species
   richness under high grazing than under low grazing. However, nine of
   these 25 comparisons showed no significant impact of grazers on species
   richness, while two comparisons showed declines in species richness
   under high grazing. Based on all the comparisons, plant species richness
   decreases with high grazing in nutrient-poor ecosystems, while it
   increases with high grazing in nutrient-rich ecosystems. Although
   nutrient-rich ecosystems seemed to produce more variable responses to
   grazers than did nutrient-poor ecosystems, in rare cases high grazing
   produced a decline in species richness in nutrient-rich environments. We
   suggest that species richness declines with high grazing in
   nutrient-poor ecosystems because a limitation of available resources
   prevents regrowth of species after grazing, which may not be the case in
   nutrient-rich ecosystems. It is also possible that an increase in
   species richness under high grazing in nutrient-rich ecosystems may be
   due to an increase in the dominance of inedible species. Our observation
   of a grazer reversal of plant species richness under contrasting
   nutrient richness may have important implications for management of

Abstract = {{1. From an ecological and environmental point of view, livestock
   husbandry plays a very important role as there is a valuable interaction
   between livestock and natural resources. The objective of this paper is
   to demonstrate the implications of livestock production systems of
   mountain areas of Greece for conservation ecology and pastureland
   biodiversity.
   2. Overgrazing of some mountain pastures and undergrazing of others, due
   to the depopulation of these environmentally difficult areas, have
   resulted in degradation of these areas. The relationship between
   livestock production and nature conservation is, by its nature, complex,
   delicate and sensitive to local conditions. The particular combination
   of farming practices used can be crucial in determining the biological
   richness of different sites. Low-intensity livestock systems - with low
   use of nutrient and agrochemical inputs, relative abundance of
   semi-natural vegetation and relative stability of good management
   practices - can make a positive contribution to the nature resource base
   by enhancing soil quality and increasing biodiversity. Ecological
   studies to determine optimum stocking densities in each region should be
   carried out with parallel adjustment in pastureland management
   regulations and in incentives given to farmers, in order to facilitate
   sustainability, biodiversity and nature conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Methods for monitoring and survey of plant species abundance which do
   not account for variation in scale are often insensitive and imprecise.
   In monitoring, repeated observations are usually made within a fixed
   unit. Counts of species' presence must be made in a range of subunit
   sizes to accommodate the range of scales at which different species
   occur. A method comprising a rectangular fixed unit containing an 8 x 4
   grid of square subunits has been developed and tested. Each subunit
   comprises a series of nested cells of increasing size, within which
   species are recorded cumulatively. Using this method, the concept of
   optimum scale is introduced. The optimum scale for a species is that for
   which its frequency count is closest to the midpoint. Two
   characteristics, sensitivity (absolute change detected) and blindness
   (failure to detect change in a species) were calculated for 24 plots
   from lowland grazing marsh which had been partially flooded between the
   time of two surveys. Optimum scale had greater sensitivity and lower
   blindness than any single scale in the majority of plots. Combining
   sensitivity and blindness, optimum scale was always superior. For the
   whole sample, optimum scale was less likely to cause Type I or Type II
   errors. The method is recommended for monitoring grasslands and allied
   plant communities in large geographical areas.}},

Abstract = {{Short-term field experiments are often used to predict and evaluate
   long-term management effects. Based on a mowing experiment in two
   calcareous fens near Lake Neuchatel, Switzerland, we investigated
   whether shea-term treatment effects (i.e. during the first four years)
   were confirmed by longterm results (13 - 14 yr). Plots were mown in
   summer or in winter or left unmown. The main long-term trends in overall
   species composition (based on percentage cover estimates) were already
   observable in the first four years: mown and unmown plots diverged,
   whereas summer-cut and winter-cut plots remained similar. At the
   individual species level, however, short-term and long-term treatment
   effects differed considerably: many species whose abundance seemed
   affected by treatments during the first four years showed no response in
   the long term, and vice versa. These discrepancies were similar when
   based on cover estimates or on counts of shoots. Species responses did
   actually depend on the time scale considered. Short-term and long-term
   treatment effects on species richness were similar (i.e. a decrease in
   unmown plots), although only long-term effects were significant.
   Treatment effects on the above-ground biomass varied considerably, and
   short-term trends (lower biomass in unmown plots) differed from
   long-term trends (higher biomass in unmown plots). Our sites showed
   little overall change in species composition during the period
   investigated, and treatment effects were low compared with other similar
   experiments. if study sites are less stable or treatment effects more
   drastic, a short-term evaluation is expected to be even less reliable.
   Knowledge on species dynamics at a site may help to choose the adequate
   spatial and temporal scale of investigation, and thus increase the
   efficiency of management experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing control has been reported to be effective for the control of
   desertification in semi-arid regions. However, economic reasons often
   make complete inhibition of grazing (complete exclosure) difficult to
   carry out. Grazing control has been applied to the Kerqin Sandy Lands,
   Inner Mongolia, China, by means of seasonal exclosure, whereby grazing
   is allowed from November to Apt-ii. The harvesting of hay is also
   allowed once during September - October. The aim of the reported study
   was to evaluate the effectiveness of this seasonal exclosure on
   vegetation restoration. Species compositional data were obtained from
   356 quadrats and ordinated by Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA).
   Ordination indicated that landform was the most important factor
   influencing the species composition of the vegetation. Regardless of
   landform and type of grazing control, however, vegetation coverage,
   vegetation height and species richness were higher at sites where
   grazing had been controlled, than at sites lacking any control.
   Perennial species were dominant at the former while annual species were
   dominant at the latter. Both shrub and toe species were quits rare at
   the sites where seasonal exclosure had been carried out. It is concluded
   that seasonal exclosure is sufficient to restore and maintain grassland
   vegetation in and around the study area. When shrubby or tree vegetation
   is needed for reasons such as fixing sands or preventing sand dune
   remobilization, complete exclosure is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of disturbance intensity and herbivory by cattle and
   white grubs, or the larvae of June beetles (including Phyllophaga
   fimbripes), to recovery of shortgrass steppe ecosystems in Colorado,
   U.S.A. were evaluated over a fourteen year time period. Disturbance
   intensity was defined by survival of the dominant grass species
   (Bouteloua gracilis) after an outbreak of root feeding activity by white
   grubs. Sixteen patches of vegetation consisting of four pairs of
   adjacent ungrazed-grazed by cattle locations with two replicates that
   were recently affected by white grubs were selected in 1977. Disturbance
   intensity was determined in 1977 by the area in each patch that
   contained live tillers of B, gracilis. Permanent plots were located both
   within and outside of each patch. Plant basal cover and density by
   species were estimated at time of peak aboveground biomass in six
   different years on each plot.
   Successional dynamics on patches was similar to areas affected by other
   types of disturbances, however, rate of recovery was faster for patches
   affected by grubs. Grazing by cattle was infrequently important to plant
   recovery. a result similar to effects of grazing on other aspects of
   shortgrass steppe ecosystems. Disturbance intensity was important to
   recovery of B, gracilis since tiller survival in 1977 was linearly
   related to cover in each year of sampling. For ungrazed patches. initial
   conditions were important to recovery of B. gracilis for as many as 14
   year. For grazed patches, initial conditions decreased and grazing
   increased in importance through time. Changes in resource quality and a
   more uniform distribution of roots due to grazing likely resulted in
   more complete mortality of plants by grubs under grazed compared to
   ungrazed conditions.
   Persistence of shortgrass ecosystems in spite of disturbances with
   different intensities are determined at least in part by characteristics
   of disturbances interacting with the ability of plants to respond, and
   in part by the evolutionary history of the system. Although white grubs
   affect shortgrass communities infrequently, they have large and
   important effects on plant community structure through time, and
   represent an important class of disturbance defined by intensity.}},

Abstract = {{Because a diversity of resources should support a diversity of
   consumers, most models predict that increasing plant diversity increases
   animal diversity. We report results of a direct experimental test of the
   dependence of animal diversity on plant diversity. We sampled arthropods
   in a well-replicated grassland experiment in which plant species
   richness and plant functional richness were directly manipulated. In
   simple regressions, both the number of species planted (log(2)
   transformed) and the number of functional groups planted significantly
   increased arthropod species richness but not arthropod abundance.
   However, the number of species planted was the only significant
   predictor of arthropod species richness when both predictor variables
   were included in ANOVAs or a MANOVA. Although highly significant,
   arthropod species richness regressions had low R(2) values, high
   intercepts (24 arthropod species in monocultures), and shallow slopes.
   Analyses of relations among plants and arthropod trophic groups
   indicated that herbivore diversity was influenced by plant, parasite,
   and predator diversity. Furthermore, herbivore diversity was more
   strongly correlated with parasite and predator diversity than with plant
   diversity. Together with regression results, this suggests that,
   although increasing plant diversity significantly increased arthropod
   diversity, local herbivore diversity is also maintained by, and in turn
   maintains, a diversity of parasites and predators.}},

Abstract = {{There has been recent interest in the characterization of soil
   biodiversity and its function in agricultural grasslands. Much of the
   interest has come from the need to develop grassland management
   strategies directed at manipulating the soil biota to encourage a
   greater reliance on ecosystem self-regulation. This review summarises
   information on selected groups of soil animals in grasslands, the
   factors influencing their abundance, diversity and community structure
   and their relationships to the functioning and stability of grassland
   ecosystems. Observations on the impacts of agricultural managements on
   populations and communities of soil fauna and their interactions confirm
   that high input, intensively managed systems tend to promote low
   diversity while tower input systems conserve diversity. It is also
   evident that high input systems favour bacterial-pathways of
   decomposition, dominated by labile substrates and opportunistic,
   bacterial-feeding fauna. In contrast, low-input systems favour
   fungal-pathways with a more heterogeneous habitat and resource leading
   to domination by more persistent fungal-feeding fauna. In view of this,
   we suggest that low input grassland farming systems are optimal for
   increasing soil biotic diversity and hence self-regulation of ecosystem
   function. Research is needed to test the hypothesis that soil
   biodiversity is positively associated with stability, and to elucidate
   relationships between productivity, community integrity and functioning
   of soil biotic communities. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the diversity of vascular plants, butterflies, grasshoppers,
   gastropods and carabid beetles in three calcareous grasslands in the
   northwestern Swiss Jura mountains, a habitat type that has decreased
   dramatically during the recent decades. As many as 58 species (ca 22\%)
   of the 266 collected are listed as threatened in northern Switzerland.
   The number of threatened species ranged from 27 to 49 per site, and 26
   species occurred in only one of the three grasslands. The species
   richness of butterflies and vascular plants correlated positively among
   the grasslands, while the species richness of other groups did not
   covary. An index of complementarity indicated that the species
   compositions (including non-threatened species, and spiders and oribatid
   mites) of the groups varied greatly among the grasslands. In addition,
   herbivorous groups were more widely distributed than predators among the
   three grasslands. Due to this variation in species composition none of
   the three sites can substitute for the others, if the biodiversity of
   these grasslands is to be maintained. Furthermore, the taxonomic groups
   studied are poor indicators of each others' diversity. Consequently, we
   support the `shopping basket' approach to conservation evaluation, i.e.
   measuring species richness, species composition and complementarity of
   several groups instead of just one.}},

Abstract = {{Permanent pastures and meadows are species-rich vegetation systems that
   play an important role in the ecology and agriculture of temperate
   climates. Intensive management reduces species diversity and may also
   influence the genetic diversity within individual species and

   variability of meadow fescue, an important component of species-rich
   grasslands, and to determine whether fertilization and defoliation
   frequency influence genetic variability within natural populations.
   Genetic diversity of six natural populations and three cultivars of
   Festuca pratensis was investigated using randomly amplified polymorphic
   DNA (RAPD) markers and agronomic traits. Samples of natural populations
   were taken from two unrelated long-term experiments, where treatments
   had been applied for 11-38 years. RAPD analysis detected a clear genetic
   distinction of the cultivars from the natural populations. Genetic
   variability within cultivars was lower than within natural populations.
   Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed a significant effect of
   management on genetic variability. Fertilization and frequent
   defoliation led to a reduction in genetic variability within natural
   populations. Analysis of agronomic traits was only partially congruent
   with the results of RAPD analysis. This study shows that significant
   genetic variability exists within cultivars and natural populations of
   Festuca pratensis and can be reduced by intensive management.}},

Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{One of the most complex and contentious issues in Australian ecology
   concerns the environmental impact of Aboriginal landscape burning. This
   issue is not only important for the development of a comprehensive
   understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the Australian biota, but
   is central to the formulation of appropriate strategies for the
   conservation of the nation's biodiversity. Ethnographic evidence leaves
   little doubt that Aboriginal burning played a central role in the
   maintenance of the landscapes subsequently colonized by Europeans. Both
   19th century European colonists and anthropologists in the 20th century
   documented the indispensability of fire as a tool in traditional
   Aboriginal economies, which have aptly been described as `fire-stick
   farming'. Aborigines used fire to achieve short-term outcomes such as
   providing favourable habitats for herbivores or increasing the local
   abundance of food plants, but it is not clear whether or not Aborigines
   had a predictive ecological knowledge of the long-term consequences of
   their use of fire. A large body of ecological evidence suggests that
   Aboriginal burning resulted in substantial changes in the geographic
   range and demographic structure of many vegetation types. Aboriginal
   burning was important in creating habitat mosaics that favoured the
   abundance of some mammal species and in the maintenance of infrequently
   burnt habitats upon which the survival of specialized fauna depends.
   Aboriginal fire regimes were probably critical for the maintenance of at
   least one species of tree (Callitris intratropica) in the monsoon
   tropics.
   The question of the original impact of humans on the Australian
   environment is fundamentally speculative because of vague, disputed time
   frames proposed for the waves of colonization and shifting settlement
   patterns of Aborigines in the late Quaternary period. There is an
   inherent circular argument concerning the cause and effect of climate
   change, vegetation change, and burning through the late Quaternary.
   Charcoal and pollen evidence from long sedimentary cores is ambiguous
   and cannot be used to demonstrate unequivocally the initial impact of
   Aboriginal people on the landscapes of Pleistocene Australia. The sparse
   available evidence does not support the hypotheses that Aboriginal
   burning was primarily responsible for the extinction of Pleistocene
   megafauna; was critical for the maintenance of habitats of small mammals
   that have become extinct following European colonization; initiated
   widespread accelerated soil erosion rates in either the Pleistocene or
   Holocene; or forced the evolutionary diversification of the Australian
   biota. Burning may hare caused the extinction of some fire-sensitive
   species of plants and animals dependent upon infrequently burnt
   habitats, and it must have maintained structurally open vegetation such
   as grasslands and also extended the range of fire-adapted species, such
   as Eucalyptus, into environments climatically suitable for rain forest.
   Palaeoecological research concerning prior impacts of Aborigines must
   give way to focused studies of the role of different anthropogenic fire
   regimes in contemporary ecosystems that have not been destroyed by
   European colonization. Such research is crucial for comprehending the
   role of Aboriginal burning in the maintenance of Australia's unique,
   rich biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Domestic herbivores often utilize heterogeneous grasslands unevenly
   which can lead to resource degradation. However, uneven grazing can be
   beneficial for biodiversity. To fulfill multiple land use goals,
   prediction and management of spatial grazing patterns of livestock are
   essential. Simulation models based on optimal foraging theory have been
   useful for quantifying some underlying behavioral mechanisms. Controlled
   behavioral studies have shown that livestock have cognitive abilities
   sufficient to solve complex spatial tasks. Livestock appear to evaluate
   the tradeoffs between travel costs and forage quality and quantity.
   Recent studies of grazing behavior and spatial movement patterns of
   livestock have led to development and reevaluation of management tools
   to modify grazing distribution. Providing water, supplement, salt, shade
   and shelter can attract livestock to underutilized feeding sites.
   Selecting animals that are more willing to climb slopes and travel far
   from water may improve forage use in rugged terrain. To ensure the
   sustainability and productivity of heterogeneous grasslands, managers
   must be able to understand and manipulate livestock grazing patterns.
   Continued research at both theoretical and applied levels is needed. (C)

   Mongolia, China. Canopy cover for each species was recorded 2 and 3
   years after cessation of livestock grazing, as well as in an area with
   continued grazing. Total species richness, alpha diversity, beta
   diversity and canopy cover were analysed. Sixty species were recorded
   during the study; 25 of them were annuals. The total number of species
   was the same, 52, in the grazed and the protected area, but species
   richness and alpha diversity per plot were lower in the area protected
   from grazing. The beta diversity showed little difference between the
   protected area and the grazed control. The total canopy cover was
   highest in the protected area, but the cover of annuals was higher in
   the grazed area. In CA ordination, the difference between treatments
   increased with time of protection. However, in the short period covered

Abstract = {{The relative contribution of different soil organism groups to nutrient
   cycling has been quantified for a number of ecosystems. Some functions,
   particularly within the N-cycle, are carried out by very specific
   organisms. Others, including those of decomposition and nutrient release
   from organic inputs are, however, mediated by a diverse group of
   bacteria, protozoa, fungi and invertebrate animals. Many authors have
   hypothesized that there is a high degree of equivalence and flexibility
   in function within this decomposer community and thence a substantial
   extent of redundancy in species richness and resilience in functional
   capacity. Three case studies are presented to examine the relationship
   between soil biodiversity and nitrogen cycling under global change in
   ecosystem types from three latitudes, i.e. tundra, temperate grassland
   and tropical rainforest.
   In all three ecosystems evidence exists for the potential impact of
   global change factors (temperature change, COP enrichment,
   land-use-change) on the composition and diversity of the soil community
   as well as on various aspects of the nitrogen and other cycles. There
   is, however, very little unequivocal evidence of direct causal linkage
   between species richness and nutrient cycling efficiency. Most of the
   changes detected are shifts in the influence of major functional groups
   of the soil biota (e.g. between microflora and fauna in decomposition).
   There seem to be few data, however, from which to judge the significance
   of changes in diversity within functional groups. Nonetheless the soil
   biota are hypothesized to be a sensitive link between plant detritus and
   the availability of nutrients to plant uptake. Any factors affecting the
   quantity or quality of plant detritus is likely to change this link.
   Rigorous experimentation on the relationships between soil species
   richness and the regulation or resilience of nutrient cycles under
   global change thus remains a high priority.}},

Abstract = {{We synthesized published and unpublished data from long-term grazing
   treatments in North American shortgrass steppe on diversity and
   abundance of plants, lagomorphs, rodents, birds, aboveground and
   belowground macroarthropods, microarthropods, and nematodes. The
   relatively small response of the plant community to grazing provides an
   opportunity to address some broad questions concerning relationships
   among responses of structural and functional aspects of systems in
   general. Are there consistencies in diversity and abundance responses to
   prating among groups of organisms? Are some groups more sensitive than
   others, or do responses mirror that of vegetation? Are the responses in
   terms of biodiversity related to ecosystem-level functional responses?
   Diversity, abundance, dominance, and dissimilarity responses to
   long-term grazing were highly variable across classes of organisms. Some
   groups of consumers displayed large differences among treatments even
   though differences in plant community attributes were relatively minor.
   Some responses were large even when comparing ungrazed to lightly or
   lightly to moderately grazed treatments. Birds appear to be particularly
   responsive to grazing. Differences among treatments in richness within
   groups other than plants and birds were relatively minor, especially
   when compared to large declines in abundance of some groups with
   increasing grazing intensity. For the well-studied groups (plants and
   birds), shifts in species in terms of `quality' factors, such as exotic,
   endemic, and rare, generally suggest that livestock grazing may be more
   similar to conditions in recent evolutionary time in this particular
   system than would conditions resulting from the removal of the exotic,
   domestic grazers that appear to functionally serve as a surrogate to
   bison.
   Trophic structure composition did not vary greatly across grazing
   treatments. Further, large effects of grazing on some consumer groups
   did not translate into similarly large effects on ecosystem processes
   such as primary production or soil nutrient pools and cycling rates.}},

Abstract = {{An early focus on ungulate foraging behavior occurred in the 1940's as
   scientists began quantifying the activities of livestock and wildlife to
   address production goals. Interest resurfaced in the 1970's and
   continued as investigators pondered behavior related hypotheses at
   evolutionary, ecosystem, and plant/animal interface levels. Presently,
   many grazing land environmental concerns are related to the selective
   foraging habits of ungulates and their poor distribution about the
   landscape. These two facets of ungulate behavior serve as the impetus
   for many of today's research efforts. and scientists in the field need
   to develop a theoretical framework to address these problems. The
   theories of optimum foraging and adaptive rumen function were offered to
   explain evolutionary patterns of forego selection among herbivores, but
   they lack the specificity needed by range and pasture managers at
   relevant space and time scales. While post-ingestive feedback mechanisms
   cause aversions to toxic plants, and some species of herbivores have
   developed means of neutralizing harmful compounds, the mechanisms
   stimulating the development of forage preferences in the absence of
   aversive compounds are not clearly understood. Ungulates also exhibit
   selective patterns of spatial use about the landscape. In some
   environments where necessary resources (water, shade, forage. minerals,
   escape topography or cover) are scarcer areas of activity will be
   focused about these limiting elements. Many of the herding ungulates,
   however, repeatedly regraze certain areas and avoid other equally
   suitable portions of the landscape. Research suggests these habits
   elevate the animal's nutritional status by curtailing advances in plant
   phenology and removing the hindrances of cured forage from the grazed
   parches. Such a scenario increases landscape diversity and may enhance
   species richness and accelerate nutrient cycling in the grazed areas by
   maintaining vegetation in an earlier stage of succession. Recent
   investigations suggest that ungulates ran retain and use spatial memory
   to expedite foraging, and can associate shapes and colors with the
   presence or absence of food. These skills have been clearly demonstrated
   in small, well controlled environments, but patterns of behavior and
   distribution in extensive landscape settings are poorly understood. The
   recent advances in geographic information systems and global positioning
   systems will assist us greatly in our analyses of ungulate behavior at
   landscape levels of resolution. Pasture and landscape managers are
   beginning to recognize many of the innate habits and preferences of
   livestock though, and are exploiting these behaviors to affect plant
   succession, control weeds, and manipulate forage quality or structure of
   the plant community. There is much left to learn, but as we make inroads
   in these endeavors, the value of grazing animals can only increase.}},

Abstract = {{Because the quantity, quality, and heterogeneity of resources should
   affect the diversity of consumers, plant productivity, plant
   composition, and plant diversity may influence the diversity of trophic
   levels higher up the food chain ({''}bottom-up{''} control of
   diversity). Increasing plant productivity may increase herbivore
   diversity by: increasing the abundance of rare resources ({''}resource
   rarity hypothesis{''}), increasing herbivore abundance and local
   persistence ({''}consumer rarity hypothesis{''}) or increasing
   intraspecific density dependence ({''}density dependence
   hypothesis{''}). Increasing plant diversity may increase the diversity
   of herbivores because herbivores specialized on these new plant species
   can persist locally. Increasing the diversity of herbivores could
   likewise increase the diversity of predators and parasites, although
   parasite and predator diversity may also respond directly to changes in
   vegetation. Here I use data from a well-replicated grassland experiment
   at Cedar Creek, Minnesota, to analyze the responses of arthropod
   diversity to independent manipulations of (1) plant productivity and (2)
   plant diversity and composition. Long-term nitrogen addition
   ({''}historical treatment{''}) decreased plant diversity and favored C-3
   grasses. Short-term nitrogen addition ({''}modern treatment{''})
   increased plant productivity without appreciably changing plant
   diversity or plant composition. Arthropods were sampled using both sweep
   nets and vacuum samplers.
   Total arthropod species richness and abundance, as well as species
   richness and abundance of every trophic group (detritivores, herbivores,
   parasites, and predators), were significantly greater in plots with
   higher levels of modern fertilization and greater plant productivity.
   Path analysis supported the consumer rarity hypothesis, because modern
   fertilization increased herbivore species richness only indirectly by
   increasing herbivore abundance. Surprisingly, higher levels of
   historical fertilization that lowered plant species richness (but did
   not change plant productivity) significantly increased total arthropod
   species richness, did not affect detritivore or herbivore species
   richness, and significantly increased parasite and predator species
   richness. Direct and indirect effects of historical fertilization on the
   species richness of trophic groups were separated statistically using
   block regression chain modeling. Herbivore species richness was
   decreased through the direct pathway, but this was offset through
   indirect effects so that there was no overall response to historical
   fertilization. In plots with low plant diversity, similar numbers of
   herbivore species supported a greater diversity of parasites and
   predators. These results suggest that the diversity and composition of
   plants control the diversity of consumers not only directly by
   determining available resources, but also indirectly by influencing the
   interactions between herbivores and their parasites and predators.}},

Abstract = {{A challenge facing forest managers is providing habitats for wildlife
   associated with mature or old-growth forests. One approach is to use
   partial cutting which maintains forest cover while still allowing timber
   harvest. We compared small mammal (voles, mice and shrews) and bird
   abundance after two intensities of partial cutting (30\% and 60\% volume
   removal) to clearcuts and uncut natural stands in coast-interior
   transitional forests of British Columbia. The 30\% removal resulted in
   no significant difference in the bird community compared to the uncut
   stands, while southern red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi)
   increased in abundance. Bird and small mammal communities in the 60\%
   removal treatment were closer to the uncut forest than to clearcuts, but
   also included species typical of clearcuts. At least one bird species,
   Yellow-rumped Warbler (Dendroica coronata), was most abundant in the
   60\% removal treatment. Several species such as the meadow vole
   (Microtus pennsylvanicus) and Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis) were most
   abundant in clearcuts, and Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza lincolnii) and
   Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina) were almost exclusively found in
   clearcuts. Scattered aspen and birch trees left in two of the clearcuts
   were used as cavity nest trees by Red-breasted Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus
   ruber), Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus), and Tree Swallows
   (Tachycineta bicolor). We concluded that both of the partial cutting
   treatments provided habitat for small mammals and birds typical of
   mature forest, although the heavy removal began to show a shift towards
   species typical of clearcuts. Because no single treatment was optimal
   for all species, we recommend that partial cutting be part of a
   landscape strategy to provide a range of habitat conditions similar to
   those occurring under natural disturbance regimes.}},

   stocking rates, but decreased in the exclosure. Cover of dwarf shrubs
   did not change in any treatment. Diversity of the community, measured in
   Shannon-Wiener and species richness index, increased in the exclosure,
   and species richness was reduced under high stocking rates. Transitions
   were explored by means of PCA. While all treatments moved along the axes
   of the multivariate space, we detected no thresholds and found no
   indications of having induced transitions to alternate states with the
   grazing treatments imposed.
   The open grasslands at our experimental site could be considered stable
   states induced by a century of domestic grazing, and they withstood 10
   years of grazing at 0.60 sheep ha(-1) without unfavourable transitions.
   Even though, loss of palatable species and diversity could indicate that
   moderate, variable stocking rates (average 0.40 sheep ha(-1)) would be
   closer to `sustainable' in the long-term. Vegetation seems to retain the
   ability to build up cover and diversity after a stocking rate reduction.

Abstract = {{The species richness and abundance of selected xylophagous (Buprestidae,
   Cerambycidae and Lucanidae) and rhizophagous or saprophagous beetles
   (phytophagous Scarabaeidae) were compared between various forest stands
   with different ecotone structures. Window traps and water traps were
   used to sample the beetles. Among the 65 captured species, 13 belonged
   to the Buprestidae, 41 to the Cerambycidae, 8 to the phytophagous
   Scarabaeidae and 3 to the Lucanidae. Forest stand and ecotone type were
   found to have a significant influence on these beetle communities. In
   oak stands, typical species such as Plagionotus arcuatus, Anoplodera
   sexguttata or Anthaxia salicis were found, while in beach forests
   Platycerus caprea was found as a characteristic species. Natural edges
   are characterised by grassland and shrub species such as Agapanthia
   violacea, Phytoecia cylindrica and Anthaxia nitidula. In artificial
   clearings, species living in old stumps such as Corymbia rubra, Prionus
   coriarius, Rhagium bifasciatum, or Anastrangalia sanguinolenta are
   common as well as species living in the small branches left after a
   cutting, the most common of which being Stenurella melanura. In order to
   conserve a high diversity of forest beetles, oaks should be favoured (it
   hosts 9 typical species in our study) and diversified structures such as
   natural edges and artificial clearings must be maintained or created.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread deforestation has led to an increase in secondary forest in
   the tropics. During the late 1940s in Puerto Rico, forest covered only
   6\% of the island, but a shift from agriculture to industry has led to
   the increase of secondary forest. This study focuses on the regeneration
   of forest following the abandonment of pastures and coffee plantations
   located in the karst region of Puerto Rico. Alluvial terraces and
   sinkholes were the principal features used for pastures, shifting
   agriculture, and coffee plantations, whereas mogotes (limestone hills of
   conical shape) were burned periodically or cut for charcoal or wood
   production. Abandoned pasture sites had a greater woody species
   diversity in comparison with coffee sites. The density of woody stems
   was greater in the abandoned pasture sites and Spathodea campanulata was
   the dominant species. In coffee sites Guarea guidonia was the most
   abundant species. There was no difference in basal area between the two
   land uses. Canonical Correspondence Analysis applied separately to
   adults and seedlings clearly separated each community according to land
   use. Seedling composition in coffee sites indicates a resistance to
   change in terms of the dominant species while in the pasture sites the
   composition will change as the dominant species S. campanulata is
   replaced with more shade tolerant species. Patches of forest that
   remained on the steep sides of mogotes and the presence of bats appears
   to have enhanced forest recovery, but the land use history of these
   sites has affected the pattern of regeneration and will continue to
   affect forest dynamics for many years. The karst area is a critical
   environment for water resources and biodiversity and its conservation
   and restoration is essential. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{`Grasshopper assemblages were sampled in 44 plots in each of three
   adjacent sites in a 40-year-old southern tall grassland experimental
   area in South Africa. Specific plots received particular mowing and/or
   burning treatments over the 40-year period. Grasshopper responses to
   vegetation type, and to different burning and mowing practices, were
   site-specific, despite the close proximity of sites. This suggests that
   grasshopper assemblage composition is not entirely deterministic and
   depends on the trajectory of plant succession. Grasshopper species
   richness and abundance decreased from annually to triennially burnt
   plots, and increased in plots mown once per year to plots mown three
   times per year. Burning in the first week of August (winter) was more
   favourable for grasshopper assemblages than burning in autumn or after
   the first spring rains. Mean grasshopper species richness was highest in
   plots mown after the first spring rains, and the mean number of
   individuals was highest in plots mown early in summer. When annually
   burnt plots were compared with annually mown plots, grasshopper
   abundance and species richness were highest in the burnt plots. A
   rotational winter burning programme, which is practical under African
   conditions, is recommended for the conservation of grasshoppers and

Abstract = {{A held experiment was established in the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea
   to test the relative roles of the availability of propagules and light
   competition in the restoration dynamics of a former calcareous grassland
   overgrown by pine (Pinus sylvestlis L.). The treatments were:
   clear-cutting of trees with additional grazing and transplantation of
   sods from an open grassland with all possible sources of propagules.
   Species richness and composition were studied on a small-scale during 7
   years in the transplanted patches of 20 x 20 cm and in their
   surroundings of 50 x 50 cm. In the cut and grazed site the species
   richness increased. Transplantation of sods from an open species-rich
   grassland did not result in higher richness even in their closest
   surroundings. In the forest, transplanted patches lost their high
   species richness by the second year. In the cut and grazed site,
   transplanted patches remained species-rich, but after 3 years, control
   patches reached the same level of species richness. In landscapes where
   former species-rich limestone grasslands are overgrown, but the local
   species pool has not yet changed, restoration of semi-natural grassland
   communities does not require the additional input of diaspores of
   grassland species. Transplantation of sods is potentially important

Abstract = {{An ordination of floristic data from the grassy vegetation of the
   Darling Downs in southern Queensland describes four broad vegetation
   types, red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis/E. tereticornis) woodland
   associated with the flood-plain of the major streams, grassland on
   alluvial clay, poplar box (E. populnea) on clay loam terraces and hill
   woodland dominated by any of E. albens, E. crebra, E. melliodora, E.
   orgadophila. Ten per cent of species proved sensitive to grazing
   intensity categories (derived largely from land tenure) in hill woodland
   compared to 3\% of species in grassland or poplar box woodland. There
   were no clear trends in the relative response of native and exotic
   species, although overall, species richness was greatest in either the
   moderate or heavily grazed treatment for all broad vegetation types. It
   is suggested that the interaction between Themeda dominance and the
   inter-tussock flora may contribute to the importance of grazing as a
   determinant of floristic composition in hill woodland broad vegetation
   type. Mechanical disturbance is implicated as a means of effecting the
   spread of exotic plants. However, there are relatively few exotic
   species that appear to have the capacity to displace native species
   without mechanical disturbance, although a notable exception is Phyla
   canescens in the flood-prone habitat. Moderate domestic stock grazing is
   compatible with nature conservation on the Darling Downs, although it is
   demonstrated that a proportion of the flora is sensitive to grazing.
   Remnants will need to be managed under a range of grazing regimes,
   including light total grazing pressure that excludes domestic stock to
   ensure the survival of the full range of species. (C) 1998 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To investigate long-term effects of land use on the soil seed bank, we
   compared the abundance/density, species richness, life form
   distribution, and species composition of seeds stored in the soil of
   four 15-20 yr-old second-growth stands, two old-growth stands, and two
   previously selectively-logged stands in the Caribbean lowlands of Costa
   Rice. Surface soil (10 cm deep, 4.7 cm diameter) was collected at 10 m
   intervals along three 120-160 m long transects in each stand (44-48 soil
   cores, 22-24 combined seed bank samples per site). Seed density was
   highest but variable in second-growth stands (8331-14535 seeds/m(2)),
   low and homogeneous in old-growth stands (2258-2659 seeds/m(2)), and
   intermediate and highly variable in selectively-logged stands (1165-6854
   seeds/m(2)), which also had contrasting logging intensities. Species
   richness was strongly dependent on seed density, but showed less
   variation. Life form distribution did not differ statistically among or
   within land-use categories. In each stand, herbs-forbs, shrubs, and
   vines dominated the seed bank (> 75\% of the species richness and
   abundance), whereas trees were a minor component (< 20\% of the species
   richness and < 5\% of the abundance) and were predominantly early
   successional. Shrubs and vines were most abundant in second-growth
   stands where regrowth vegetation was repeatedly cut before abandonment,
   whereas grasses and sedges were most abundant in the only forest stand
   that was completely surrounded by pastures. In terms of species
   composition, old-growth stands were more similar to selectively-logged
   stands than to second-growth stands, bur across stands,
   selectively-logged forests were most distinct from the other two forest
   types. An inventory of the standing woody vegetation in each site showed
   little representation of the woody taxa found in the seed bank. We
   discuss these results in the context of the main factors that have been
   postulated to influence the abundance, life form, and species
   composition of tropical forest seed banks, and explore the role of the
   latter during intermediate phases of tropical forest succession and
   regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{In the Jura mountains extensive management created some of the
   species-richest plant communities of central Europe: calcareous
   grasslands of the `Teucrio-Mesobrometum type. Here we summarize evidence
   about the influence of contrasting management on species diversity and
   species abundance in these grasslands. Based on phyto-sociological
   releves (each ca. 0.1 ha) of 72 sites, 46 of which were regularly grazed
   by cattle and 26 were mowed, it is shown that pastures tend to be richer
   in species (on average 59 versus 46 species in meadows). 90\% of all 137
   species recorded occurred in both types of grassland. The higher species
   diversity in pastures is explained by greater spatial heterogeneity due
   to micropatterns of grazing, trampling and dung deposition. We conclude
   that only a minor set of species can be considered to be
   management-specific while the majority of species is equally abundant in
   both types of grassland. Hence, responses of the vegetation to a change
   in management are likely to cause only small alterations in community
   structure, at least for periods of several years to a few decades.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution of free-feeding insect herbivores in Brazilian savanna
   was studied in the National Park of Serra do Cipo. Insect samples were
   obtained with sweep nets across cerrado (savanna), rupestrian field and
   altitudinal grassland vegetation from 800 to 1500 m above sea level. We
   found a low species richness in xeric and mesic habitats during both wet
   and dry seasons. Sap-sucking insects were the most abundant guild
   (53.4\%) with Cicadellidae the most abundant family (27.2\%). The
   hypothesis that taxon richness of free-feeding insects decreases with
   increasing altitude was supported in xeric habitats during the wet
   season only, mainly as a function of mountain summit effect. There was a
   decrease of 65\% in the number of families occurring at 1400 and 1500 m
   compared with lower elevations. The exclusion of sites of rupestrian
   vegetation at mid-elevations from the analysis increased significantly
   the proportion of variance explained by the model. An examination of
   taxon distribution using canonical variate analysis supported this
   result. The hypothesis that mesic habitats are richer in species of
   free-feeding insect herbivores than are xeric habitats was not
   supported. The data indicate that plant sclerophylly may exert a strong
   negative influence on insect species richness, and that variation due to
   particular characteristics of each site strongly affected the studied
   guilds. The present results should inform conservation strategies for
   the National Park Management Plan, which is currently being developed.}},

Abstract = {{The subalpine oligotrophic heath-grasslands, assigned to the
   Pulsatillo-Vaccinietum and Violo-Nardetum, occurring at the upper ridges
   in the Vosges at 1100 - 1300 m a.s.l. are of conservational interest
   because they form natural, mature and stable ecosystems. The
   Pulsatillo-Vaccinietum is particularly rich in endemic plant species and
   subspecies due to a local oceanic-subarctic climate and the continuous
   occurrence of the community throughout the Holocene period, when the
   association was not affected by changes in the prevailing environmental
   conditions.
   After a period of abandonment during and after World War II, agriculture
   was intensified through mineral fertilization and liming, sometimes
   mowing, and even ploughing and sowing.
   Seven pastures were selected to estimate the present plant biodiversity.
   Losses of biodiversity were assessed on the Kastelberg ridge by
   diachronic analysis of the vegetation composition and structure over the
   last 30 years.
   Species diversity changed in both associations through a decrease in the
   abundance of oligotrophic, acidophilic species, typical of the mountains
   of western Europe, and an extension of grassland types of the
   Violo-Nardetum trifolietosum.
   Strategies for a return to more natural conditions include the
   abandonment of fertilization and liming, except locally around farms.
   Regular mowing is needed in order to decrease the nutrient level of the

Abstract = {{After abandonment many limestone grasslands have been overgrown by trees
   and shrubs; as a result, species-rich communities with many regionally
   rare and endangered species are vanishing. Some studies suggest that, in
   cases where grassland is being restored, the species composition and
   rate of change is strongly dependent on the initial conditions, i.e. the
   earlier presence of grassland species and the opportunity for
   colonization of new sites by grassland species. These hypotheses were
   tested in a five-year restoration experiment after the clearing of a
   35-yr-old secondary pine wood developed on abandoned grassland. Tree
   cutting induced rapid changes in the floristic composition and species
   cover. The number of grassland species from the class Festuco-Brometea
   increased significantly in the restored grassland, but their cover was
   much lower than in the old grassland. Canonical Correspondence Analysis
   showed significant differences in species composition between the
   grassland restored in former wood gaps and that developed in former
   closed wood In wood gap sites the cover of species from the class
   Molinio-Arrhenatheretea and tufted perennials was much higher, whereas
   the cover of Festuco-Brometea species was lower. Significantly more
   shrubs, woodland species, ruderal and nitrophilous species as well as
   annual and biennial species occurred in the former dosed wood site. It
   was found that richness and composition of the restored grassland
   depended strongly on the community composition before tree cutting, as
   well as on the presence of grassland species in the neighbourhood.
   Periodical tree cutting enables the maintenance of a temporal-spatial
   mosaic of scrub-grassland communities in isolated habitats and the
   preservation of local species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The seed banks of three grazed and three ungrazed seashore meadows were
   studied on the west coast of Finland. 8486 seedlings (mean 13 669
   seedlings/m(2)) germinated from cold-treated samples (n = 343; depth =
   10 cm). Most seedlings and species were monocots and perennials. The
   seed bank flora included 54 dicots vs. 28 monocots and 66 perennials vs.
   16 annuals. The most abundant species were Juncus gerardii,
   Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, Eleocharis uniglumis, Agrostis
   stolonifera, Juncus bufonius and Carex nigra, which made up 73 \% of the
   seed bank.
   Numbers of species and seedlings differed between elevation classes.
   Species richness was highest in elevation class 50 - 70 cm. The highest
   seed density occurred in class 20 - 50 cm. A model for size and species
   composition of the seed bank in relation to elevation is presented. The
   seed bank was larger and richer in species in the ungrazed than in the
   grazed sites, but not so in the upper elevations and closest to the open
   sea. Grazing reduced the size of the seed bank of Agrostis stolonifera,
   A. capillaris, Calamagrostis stricta, Elymus repens, Juncus bufonius,
   Limosella aquatica and Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani, but increased
   that of J. gerardii. 32 species germinated only from ungrazed samples
   and 11 species only from grazed ones. Multivariate classification
   resulted in nine sample groups. The ordination scatter was best
   explained by the flooding stress variables, elevation, the distance from
   the water line and the number of helophyte species in samples.
   75 species were found both in the seed bank and in the vegetation, but
   there was a significant lack of resemblance (in the Mantel test) due to
   over-representation of some species. Eight species occurring only in the
   seed bank were mainly annuals or biennials (63 \%); those occurring only
   in the established vegetation (86 species) were mainly perennials (86
   \%).}},

Abstract = {{. A small-scale restoration experiment concerning a species-rich
   calcareous grassland was conducted over a 7-yr period. 20 yr of
   abandonment (1971-1990) resulted in both a strong reduction of the
   number of species and an absolute dominance of the shrub Crataegus
   monogyna and the grass Brachypodium pinnatum - which contributed 98\% of
   the above-ground herb phytomass. The plot (3 m x 6 m) was cleared in
   September 1990 and thereafter yearly mown in autumn. Small soil seed
   bank samples were taken immediately after clearing and again in the
   autumn of 1996. The inner part of the plot showed a reduced soil seed
   bank compared to the plot underneath the vegetation outside the plot in
   1990. Six years later an increased number of seeds in the soil in this
   inside area could be recorded mainly in the upper soil layer, although
   the amount was only 40\% compared to the outside or control area. Ca.
   20\% of the species present in the restored vegetation were recorded in
   seed traps during the main seed dispersal period in 1997. Restoration of
   high species richness in the plot was a fast process during the first
   few years: from seven species in 1990 towards 39 three years later. This
   was significantly faster than the restoration process of the calcareous
   grassland at the same slope 20 yr earlier. This was probably due to the
   increased size of the community species pool at the site as a result of
   appropriate management during the last decades. Relative species number
   increase was highest at the largest scale during this experiment, viz.
   at the total plot area. The success of restoration of species-rich, dry
   grassland vegetation largely depends on the interaction between several
   conditions, e.g. seed availability, either originating from the seed
   rain or soil seed bank, favourable germination conditions and a
   successful development to a mature, seed producing individual.
   Germination and establishment strongly depend on suitable vegetation
   structure as a result of sustainable management.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{. Species richness in calcareous grassland is discussed against the
   background of historical dispersal processes associated with traditional
   land-use management such as grazing, but also the artificial
   establishment by hayseed. Important vectors in the traditionally
   man-made landscape were sheep and cattle or other livestock such as
   goats. Calcareous grasslands were not only connected to each other but
   also to other habitats such as villages, forests, arable fields and
   heathlands by these vectors which could cover large distances (e.g.
   transhumance shepherding), which is not the case in the current man-made
   landscape. Species richness after restoration management of abandoned
   and afforested calcareous grasslands was predicted by using characters
   of dispersability in space and time. These were the persistence of the
   species in the vegetation and the diaspore bank after abandonment or
   afforestation and the dispersal capacity through wind and sheep. The
   results reveal that reintroduction of sheep grazing is necessary to
   reestablish the original species richness. The first validation of the
   prediction of the succession on clear-cut sites and a comparison with
   data of species composition in abandoned quarries and the surroundings
   made it obvious that a species' own dispersal capacity in space is very
   low except for some well wind-dispersed species. Therefore, it is
   recommended to include and to simulate dispersal processes in future
   management to be able to restore the original species richness.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{463-477}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Deciduous forests in much of southern Sweden are often located on former
   `in-field' sites close to farms and villages. The more distant
   `out-field' sites are almost always dominated by conifers. Using
   palaeecological methods, we investigate the origin of this forest
   pattern at a small estate in Smaland, southern Sweden that was the
   birthplace of Carl Linnaeus.
   Prior to extensive permanent settlement (c. AD 1100) both in-fields and
   out-fields supported a rich, mixed deciduous forest that was irregularly
   ravaged by forest fire. After AD 1100 the in-field site was transformed
   into a species-rich forest-meadow system with tree composition similar
   to the pre-cultural state with the addition of Fagus sylvatica L. The
   out-field sites were used for grazing and slash-and-burn agriculture,
   but nevertheless maintained a high degree of forest continuity. Forest
   composition however changed from deciduous to coniferous dominance.
   Floristic diversity is closely linked to human activity. Herbaceous
   diversity is greatest during the earliest phase of the forest-meadow
   system. It declines during the late-mediaeval agrarian crisis and again
   during the over-exploitation of the late nineteenth century. Diversity
   returns to pre-cultural levels after the abandonment of the

Abstract = {{Although there is a great deal of concern about the effects of human
   activities on biodiversity, until recently there has been very little
   interest in the effects of ozone on the species that constitute the
   major part of the flora, the diverse herbaceous and shrubby species of
   natural and semi-natural communities. However, many wild species have
   been shown to be at least as sensitive to ozone as crops that show
   significant yield losses, so there is a pressing need for-an evaluation
   of the risk to wild species posed by ozone. This review attempts to
   assess progress and highlight problems. It begins with a comment on
   semantics, discusses the difficulties involved in measuring relative
   ozone resistance and then proceeds to consider the effects of ozone on
   growth and resource allocation. The evidence for evolution of resistance
   is appraised and then the potential effects of several interactions
   (cutting/grazing, competition, soil water deficit and nutrition) are
   considered. The review ends with some remarks on observation of
   oxidant-induced changes in ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Two data sets, one from the 1960s and one from 1990, from continuously
   managed semi-natural meadows (seminatural grasslands used for
   hay-cutting) in Smaland, southern Sweden, were analysed to describe the
   vegetation and in an attempt to characterise changes that have occurred
   in the vegetation. Based on a classification of the data set, nine plant
   communities were recognised. The main vegetational differences, as
   revealed by an ordination, were due to variation in soil moisture, which
   ranged from wet to dry.
   During the investigation period, the amount of hay meadow area
   decreased, particularly the area of wet-moist meadows. In addition, the
   total variation in the vegetation diminished, and three plant
   communities more or less disappeared. The turnover index of species in
   the data set was 36\%, and most of the species that were lost had
   initially been uncommon. Lost species included rare taxa, such as
   Gentianella campestris and Linum cartharticum, while the new species
   tended to be common in the region. Annual and biennial species accounted
   for a greater proportion of the lost taxa than did perennial species.
   The mean cover of species per plot and the relative abundance of
   graminoids per plot increased.
   The recorded changes in the vegetation may be related to the increased
   loads of nitrogen pollutants as well as to a decrease in management
   intensity. The diminished area is related to changes in land-use. The
   meadow sites in Smaland have been part of a landscape rich in
   grasslands, but today they have a more or less relict status. They
   differ from grasslands found elsewhere in Sweden and Scandinavia. In
   Sweden, the majority (68\%) of endangered vascular plants belong to the
   agricultural landscape. To ensure the survival of individual species it
   is important to preserve all types of meadows, not only a few selected
   ones, since no two meadows are alike.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{1998}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Most species-rich grasslands dominated by Themeda triandra in
   southeastern Australia have been ungrazed and frequently burnt for
   decades. The seedling emergence technique was used to determine the size
   and taxonomic composition of the soil seed bank of five grasslands that
   had different fire histories (i.e. burnt at 1 yr, 3 yr and greater than
   or equal to 10 yr intervals) and this was compared to the standing
   vegetation at each sire. A nested sampling design (subplot, plot, site)
   was used to determine the effect of spatial scale on the patterns
   observed in both the vegetation and the seed bank. Temporal variation in
   the seed bank was assessed by repeated soil sampling over a two year
   period. 61 native and 30 exotic species were recorded in the vegetation.
   Richness varied more between sites than within sites. Sites were
   therefore internally homogeneous for species richness. However, no
   correlation between burning frequency and richness was found. DCA
   ordination separated the sites into distinct groups, but sites with
   similar fire history did not necessarily group closely. 60 taxa
   germinated from the soil seed bank, comprising 32 native and 28 exotic
   species; 11 species, mostly therophytes, were restricted to the seed
   bank. The richness of the seed bank was significantly lower than the
   vegetation at all spatial scales. No correlation between seed bank
   richness and fire history was found. The seed bank of species-rich
   grasslands is dominated by a limited number of widespread, highly
   clumped, annual, native and exotic monocots. Most native
   hemicryptophytes, and perennials in general, were represented in the
   soil by a transient seed bank. Only 12 \% of study species, all
   therophytes, were considered to form large, persistent seed banks, the
   size of which was greater in unburnt grasslands at all times of the
   year. The distinct floristic patterns observed in the vegetation are
   less clearly represented in the seed bank. The seed bank represents a
   floristically distinct (and less variable) component of the vegetation
   when compared to the standing flora. The size of the long-term. soil
   seed bank suggests that it has little functional importance for many
   native species and probably contributes little to seedling regeneration
   processes following disturbance. Altering established fire regimes is
   likely to only change the composition and small-scale richness of the
   existing site vegetation and will not re-integrate species previously
   lost from the vegetation due to past management. It is suggested that
   the maintenance of vegetation remnants and processes that encompass a
   range of long-term burning histories will be necessary if the flora is
   to be conserved in situ. Restoration of degraded grasslands cannot rely
   on the soil seed bank but rather, will be dependent on the
   reintroduction of propagules.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on species changes which occured in plots in a

   based on the pioneering work of B. Rosengurtt who sampled 10 plots in

   on rank-frequency, diversity, evenness and multivariate analyses.
   Diversity was measured as species richness S, Shannon's index H and its
   exponential form N = e(H), evenness E = N/S and Gini's coefficient of
   hierarchy G. Species-richness of the plots increased significantly.
   Species which entered the sites are mostly weedy species, while those
   that have decreased are mostly palatable forage species. Evenness,
   however, remained constant. Floristic change was chiefly associated with
   time, and secondarily with plot soil-type. During the 55 yr that elapsed

Abstract = {{In France, the Netherlands and the UK, arable field boundaries were
   extended with four metres of crop edge. Plots with perennial, herbaceous
   vegetation were established by natural regeneration or by sowing grass,
   both annually cut. Vegetation development was monitored in the first
   three years after establishment in the original boundary and in the new
   boundary strip. Species composition, species-richness and biomass
   production in the new strip were related to those in the original
   boundary to examine the potential of predicting vegetation development
   in extended field boundaries from the vegetation composition of the
   original boundary. Within three years species-richness, biomass
   production and monocot:dicot ratio in both the grass and regeneration
   plots converged to the levels of the original boundary in all three
   countries. Species composition in the new strip was not closely related
   to the original boundary, however, since only 20-50\% of the species
   encountered in the original boundary at the onset of the experiment had
   managed to colonise the new boundary strip in the final year. The low
   similarity was mainly due to low establishment rates of annual and
   woodland species in the new strip while mobile, perennial grassland
   species were generally very successful. Sowing grass, which may be
   preferable with respect to weed control, had adverse effects on
   species-richness. These relationships, which were found to apply in a
   broad geographical area and in different boundary types, may aid efforts
   to restore botanical diversity in arable field boundaries. (C) 1998

Abstract = {{Maintaining native plant diversity, detecting exotic species, and
   monitoring rare species are becoming important objectives in rangeland
   conservation. Four rangeland vegetation sampling techniques were
   compared to see how well they captured local plant diversity. The
   methods tested included the commonly used Parker transects, Daubenmire
   transects as modified by the USDA Forest Service, a new transect and
   ``large quadrat{''} design proposed by the USDA Agricultural Research
   Service, and the Modified-Whittaker multi-scale vegetation plot. The 4
   methods were superimposed in shortgrass steppe, mixed grass prairie,
   northern mixed prairie, and tallgrass prairie in the Central Grasslands
   of the United States with 4 replicates in each prairie type. Analysis of
   variance tests showed significant method effects and prairie type
   effects, but no significant method X type interactions for total species
   richness, the number of native species, the number of species with less
   than 1\% cover, and the time required for sampling. The methods behaved
   similarly in each prairie type under a wide variety of grazing regimes.
   The Parker, large quadrat, and Daubenmire transects significantly
   underestimated the total species richness and the number of native
   species in each prairie type, and the number of species with less than
   1\% cover in all but the tallgrass prairie type. The transect techniques
   also consistently missed half the exotic species, including noxious
   weeds, in each prairie type. The Modified-Whittaker method, which
   included an exhaustive search for plant species in a 20 x 50 m plot,
   served as the baseline for species richness comparisons. For all prairie
   types, the Modified-Whittaker plot captured an average of 42.9 (+/- 2.4;
   1 S.E.) plant species per site compared to 15.9 (+/- 1.3), 18.9 (+/-
   1.2), and 22.8 (+/- 1.6) plant species per site using the Parker, large
   quadrat, and Daubenmire transect methods, respectively. The 4 methods
   captured most of the dominant species at each site and thus produced
   similar results for total foliar cover and soil cover. The detection and
   measurement of exotic plant species were greatly enhanced by using ten 1
   m(2) subplots in a multi-scale sampling design and searching a larger
   area (1,000 m(2)) at each site. Even with 4 replicate sites, the
   transect methods usually captured, and thus would monitor, 36 to 66\% of
   the plant species at each site. To evaluate the status and trends of
   common, rare, and exotic plant species at local, regional, and national
   scales, innovative, multi-scale methods must replace the commonly used
   transect methods of the past.}},

Abstract = {{In France the alteration of species-rich grasslands is due mainly to
   agriculture and civil engineering projects (roadways, dams, ski resorts,
   etc.). The restoration of such ecosystems has been tested in many
   regions and after many sorts of degradation. According to the level of
   initial degradation, different responses can be envisioned. Some
   variations are presented of a general model of restoration and
   rehabilitation: (1) rejuvenation of fallow land by grazing with rustic
   animal breeds in wetlands or chalk grasslands in south and northwestern
   France, (2) restoration by recovery of extensive agricultural management
   in intensive agricultural areas such as the Rhone or Meuse Valleys, and
   (3) rehabilitation by appropriate ecological engineering carried out in
   grasslands degraded by intensification, ski-track, or civil engineering
   installations. Despite some positive results, these undertakings have
   not always had the expected effects and therefore should not provide
   alibis for the destruction of natural grasslands. In general, the
   success of such undertakings depends on the maintenance in the
   surrounding areas of protected seed source reservoirs and on the
   persistence of a diversified landscape pattern permitting connectivity
   between these seed sources and the restoration or rehabilitation sites.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Riparian habitats are centers of biological diversity in arid and
   semiarid portions of western North America, but despite widespread loss
   and degradation of these habitats there is little quantitative
   information concerning restoration of native riparian biota. We examined
   the recovery of a riparian meadow system in the context of long-term
   versus short-term release from livestock grazing. We compared the
   structure and dynamics of plant and avian communities on 1.5-ha plots
   inside a long-term (<30 years) livestock exclosure ({''}exclosure
   plots{''}), with adjacent plots outside the exclosure ({''}open
   plots{''}) for 4 years following removal of livestock from open plots.
   Throughout the study, sedge cover, forb cover, and foliage height
   diversity of herbs were greater on exclosure plots; bare ground, litter
   cover, shrub cover, and shrub foliage height diversity were greater on
   open plots. Forb, rush, and cryptogamic cover increased on open plots
   but not on exclosure plots. Grass cover increased, whereas litter and
   bare ground decreased on all plots in conjunction with increased
   availability of moisture. Sedge cover did not change. Avian species
   richness and relative abundances were greater on exclosure plots;
   species composition differed markedly between exclosure and open plots
   (Jaccard Coefficient = 0.23=0.46), with exclosure plots dominated by
   wetland and riparian birds and open plots dominated by upland species.
   The appearance of key species of wet-meadow birds on open plots in the
   third and fourth years following livestock removal signaled the
   beginning of restoration of the riparian avifauna. We interpret the
   recovery of riparian vegetation and avifaunal composition inside the
   exclosure as a consequence of livestock removal, which led to a rise in
   the water table and an expansion of the hyporbeic zone laterally from
   the stream channel. The lack of change in sedge and shrub cover on open
   plots suggests that restoration to a sedge-dominated meadow will not
   happen quickly.}},

Abstract = {{Local and regional distributions of Thymus serpyllum, in the
   southeastern part of Sweden, were examined by combining experimental
   studies of recruitment limitation and germination, and descriptive
   studies of distribution range in relation to habitat and management
   history. The spatial pattern at a regional scale in the county of
   Sodermanland was examined in relation to semi-natural pastures and
   graves from the Iron Age. The distribution of T. serpyllum was also
   examined in two parishes. Thymus serpyllum was exclusively found in
   managed, unfertilized areas, mainly semi-natural pastures and to some
   extent in road verges, and almost always in dry parts. Populations of T.
   serpyllum were found in 32 of the 42 pastures that contained Iron Age
   graves, but only in 5 of 42 pastures without graves. The distribution of
   T. serpyllum was also more or less congruent with the distribution of
   Iron Age graves, in both parishes. The seed sowing experiment showed
   that the germination rate, winter survival and recruitment were
   significantly higher in disturbed (removal of ground cover) plots, for
   both dry and mesic vegetation. Since the establishment of T. serpyllum
   occurred both in dry and mesic parts of semi-natural pastures, whereas
   T. serpyllum is confined to dry parts, the local limitation of
   distribution may be due to poor dispersal or due to effects acting on
   later life cycle stages. The results showed that the regional
   distribution of T. serpyllum is likely to be dispersal limited
   recruitment after seed sowing was equally good al sites with or without
   established populations. Seeds survived and germinated after heat
   treatment, with temperatures at 60 degrees C, 80 degrees C and 100
   degrees C, but germination rates were not higher than in the control.
   The results of this study indicate that the distribution of T. serpyllum
   is dependent on human activities, both for dispersal and for the
   maintenance of established populations. Long, continuous management by
   grazing is obviously important for the maintenance of these populations.
   The association with Iron Age graves may reflect either long continuity,
   or accidental or intentional dispersal by humans.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of ten different management regimes on the abundance and
   species richness of Araneae on pre-existing and newly expanded zones of
   field margins surrounding arable fields are compared in a large-scale
   experiment conducted between 1987 and 1991. Most of the management
   regimes involved varying the timing and frequency with which the field
   margins were cut. There was no evidence of consistent temporal trends in
   the abundance and species richness of Araneae on either the existing or
   expanded zones of the field margins during the first four years of the
   experiment. However, lowest numbers were recorded before expansion of
   the margins in 1987, and highest numbers in the final sample, in 1991.
   Araneae remained less abundant, and less species rich, on the newly
   expanded than on the existing zones of the field margins four years
   after they were `set-aside'. Cutting reduced both abundance and species
   richness. Regimes which included cutting in mid-summer had a greater
   impact which persisted for longer than did those involving cutting in
   spring and autumn. Removal of cut material was associated with lower
   species richness than leaving it in situ. Sowing the margins with a wild
   flower seed mixture was associated with increased abundance and species
   richness of Araneae, Annual spraying with a broad-spectrum,
   non-persistent herbicide reduced the abundance of Araneae but the effect
   was not detectable until several months after the application of the
   spray. Both the species richness and abundance of Araneae were
   positively correlated with a measure of vegetation height made on the
   field margins in September, on both the pre-existing and newly expanded
   zones of the margins. The extent to which management practices which
   benefit Araneae are compatible with both the management requirements for
   various other taxa, and the overriding constraint of effective
   pernicious weed control on field margins, is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The hypothesis that season of defoliation and herbivore selectivity may
   be as important as level of use in determining plant community response
   to grazing was tested in a monsoon grassland in northern Australia.
   Plots, dominated by the tussock grasses Themeda triandra and Chrysopogon
   fallax, were grazed by cattle at low, medium and high rates of
   utilization in either the early wet, late wet or dry seasons. Effects of
   grazing on species composition were greatest in the early wet season
   when high rates of utilization significantly reduced the proportion and
   occurrence of Themeda and increased the proportion of forbs. Grazing in
   the dry season had no significant effect on composition.
   At medium and high levels of utilization in the early wet season, the
   pasture responded negatively to defoliation, only partially compensating
   for plant tissue lost to herbivory. The negative response to defoliation
   can-led over to the next wet season when these same medium and
   high-grazing treatments produced only 80 \% and 60 \% growth,
   respectively, of that in treatments grazed at low levels of utilization
   or those grazed during the dry season. The frequency of Themeda was
   still lower, and that of annual grasses and non-leguminous forbs higher,
   in plots that had been grazed at a high rate of utilization for just
   eight weeks in the early wet season two years previously. Species
   richness and diversity were also significantly affected by this grazing
   disturbance. If species composition is to be maintained in these
   grasslands then stocking rates must be set at low levels to cope with
   the combined effect of undercompensation in response to defoliation in
   the wet season and strong dietary preferences for grazing sensitive
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Two abandoned and two mown adjacently situated semi-natural meadow

   physical conditions between the habitats were compared by categorizing
   the species with two competitive theories for plant strategies: the
   MacArthur-Fretwell scheme and Grime's CSR model. Both calculated
   richness indices and direct species counts indicate that diversity is
   higher in the abandoned meadow patches than in the corresponding managed
   meadows. The evenness values imply that the species dominance pattern is
   similar under both types of management. According to the CCA ordination,
   the differences in nutrient concentration between the sites
   significantly influenced the occurrence of species. The method of
   evaluating the succession stage of a habitat by combining diversity
   measures and counting plant strategy shares, especially with regard to
   competitive species, may help the manager to decide on the urgency of
   restoration. As the MacArthur-Fretwell scheme showed the prevailing
   physical conditions using species life history strategies more
   illustratively, it can be recommended for studies in which it is
   important to define the succession stage that might be fatal to high

Abstract = {{The effect of a dominant species, the litter layer, and the moss layer
   on seedlings and established vegetation was evaluated in two
   manipulative experiments in an oligotrophic wet meadow (Molinion with
   some features of Violion caninae according to phytosociological
   classification). In the first experiment the dominant species (Nardus
   stricta), litter layer and litter layer together with the moss layer
   were removed and the response of the established vegetation and
   seedlings were compared with a control. Results revealed that after one
   season there was no significant effect of the treatments on established
   vegetation, but seedling recruitment was significantly affected. The
   greatest increase of seedling recruitment for many species was observed
   in the plots with the moss layer removed. In the second experiment,
   seeds of Selinum carvifolia were sown into plots subjected to the
   following treatments: complete vegetation removal, mowing, mowing
   combined with removal of the moss layer, and an untreated control. The
   highest number of seedlings was found in plots with the vegetation
   removed, but the seedling recruitment was nearly as high in plots with
   the moss layer removed. Low numbers were found in mown plots and the
   lowest in the untreated control. The results show that seedling
   recruitment is more sensitive to competition than the established
   vegetation, at least over one season.This supports the idea of the
   importance of the regeneration niche for the maintenance of diversity in
   grassland communities.}},

Abstract = {{Wet sedge-dominated communities (sedge meadows) were sampled in five
   lowland eases in the Queen Elizabeth Islands of the Canadian High Arctic
   to assess species-environment relationships. The sites spanned 4 degrees
   of latitude, and varied in lithology and intensity of grazing by
   muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus). A suite of 8 vascular species were common
   in all meadow stands, with an additional 4-6 species found in most
   stands. The position of these species in dominance-diversity curves was
   not significantly different between,orated and ungrazed meadows however,
   the grazed sites appeared to follow a log-normal distribution, while the
   ungrazed sites were more geometric. Redundancy analysis indicated that
   grazing intensity is important in determining structure in arctic sedge
   meadows, largely through increasing the cover of bryophytes and the
   availability of nitrogen. Greatest species richness was found in the
   more southerly sites which were moderately grazed and had diversity in
   microtopography.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands are among the most threatened habitats on Earth, as large
   areas have been transformed into agricultural lands. Therefore, the
   registration of the state of grassland remnants is of crucial importance
   for conservation. An easy way to survey or monitor a habitat is to
   choose adequate indicator taxa. North American studies showed that
   grasshopper communities are good indicators of disturbance. We tested
   this observation for Hungarian steppes. The orthopteran assemblages of
   three steppe patches in the Buda Kills (Hungary) were sampled. One site
   was newly abandoned arable land, the second was a secondary meadow with
   large mammal grazing pressure, the third was a strictly protected
   seminatural steppe meadow. Our study in Hungarian steppe remnants
   supports earlier findings that orthopterans are good indicators for
   disturbance and naturalness. We found that density was highest on the
   most disturbed site, while species richness and diversity indices were
   greatest on the seminatural site, We argue that the use of simple
   statistical tests (chi(2) and rank correlation analysis) may be favoured
   in inventories or monitoring programs instead of complicated
   multivariate analysis (e.g., detrended correspondence analysis). The
   rank correlation analysis on the species abundance/site matrices proved
   to be the most effective tool in finding differences and similarities
   between orthopteran communities. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A field experiment was established in a subarctic grassland in the
   Finnish Lapland to study the role of summer herbivory in plant community
   succession. Perennial vegetation and moss cover were removed in an area
   of 324 m(2). The site was divided into four blocks, of which two were
   fenced to prevent herbivory by large mammals (reindeer, hare).
   Early successional changes in the vegetation were assessed. Mean species
   richness per 3 x 3 m plot was consistently higher in the fenced area,
   indicating that herbivory can suppress small-scale diversity. Herbivory
   affected the height of several plant species. However, there was no
   correlation between frequency and height of individual species. There
   was a weak indication that taller species were more successful in early
   succession when grazed. Light competition is apparently not a key
   process determining successional change. Thus, in early stage of
   succession, summer herbivory has little effect on diversity by limiting
   light competition, and most species are equally successful in grazed and
   ungrazed plots. There was some indirect evidence about competitive
   interactions in the developing community. However, unlike temperate
   grasslands, large mammal herbivory and competition for light seem not to
   be important determinants of community change in this subarctic
   grassland (at least what concernes early successional stages). This may
   be explained by the harshness of local climate, and abundance of light
   due to the polar day.}},

Abstract = {{Reforestation of degraded pastures in the Atlantic lowlands of Costa
   Rica since 1988 has created a patchwork of small plantations that may
   have the potential to capture and conserve the remnant biodiversity in
   this largely deforested landscape. Studies of woody regeneration in 6
   year old experimental plantations and on-farm plantations on abandoned
   pasture were conducted at the La Selva Biological Station and
   surrounding region. The experimental plantations include seven native
   and four exotic tree species, together with an abandoned pasture
   control. The impact of plantations on woody regeneration varied
   according to the plantation tree species. Some species fostered greater
   abundance of woody regeneration, some greater species richness, other
   species both abundance and richness, while another group had no effect
   significantly different from abandoned pasture. Abundance of woody
   regeneration did not appear to be related to canopy cover at the time of
   sampling, Nevertheless, plantation trees that established rapidly and
   had high growth rates did in general stimulate higher levels of woody
   regeneration. A comparison of this study with one conducted in the same
   plantations Is months later indicates that the effect of some trees
   promoting greater density of regeneration may decline over time, while
   differences in species richness may persist or strengthen. Observations
   in a range of 6 year old plantations on farms showed a wide range of
   densities of woody regeneration. Part of this variation could be
   explained by the presence or absence of grazing within the plantation.
   Abundance and species richness of woody regeneration under plantation
   stands can be substantial. Nevertheless, the incidence of mature forest
   species was low and their ability to invade in the future will probably
   depend on subsequent stand management. It must not be forgotten that the
   motivation for reforestation is primarily economic; increased
   biodiversity is a by-product that, if it is to be promoted, will require
   adaptation of management practices. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Plant species-rich Calthion meadows on mesotrophic fen pear soil
   extensively cut for hay are among the endangered semi-natural vegetation
   types in northwestern Europe. They are often badly affected by lowering
   the groundwater table (drainage) and fertilization.
   In a comparative study of an undrained site with a Calthion meadow and
   an adjacent drained site, availability of N, P and K was biologically
   assessed under field conditions (for two years) as well as in a
   greenhouse (for 18 weeks) by measuring shoot responsiveness. Also,
   experimental wetting of intact turf samples taken from both sites was
   applied in order to study the interaction between nutrient supply and
   anaerobic soil conditions. It was concluded that the above-ground
   phytomass yield in the undrained site was restricted by a major shortage
   of N-supply and a moderate shortage of K-supply by the fen peat soil.
   The above-ground phytomass yield of the drained site was only reduced by
   a strongly limited supply of K by the soil. The extent of K-deficiency
   was larger for the drained site. No P-deficiency was observed in any of
   the drained or undrained sites. Rewetting turf samples, taken from the
   drained site, did not change above-ground phytomass yields, suggesting
   that nutrient supplies were not affected by rewetting. Leaching has
   likely resulted in a strong reduction of K-supply in the drained site.
   It is assumed that a shortage in K-supply from the peat soil may have
   become an important environmental constraint for characteristic plant
   species of Calthion meadows. This may hamper the development of this
   meadow type on drained peat soils after rewetting by groundwater
   discharge.}},

Abstract = {{The two main biotic factors affecting grassland plant species are
   herbivory and competition. We investigated the significance of both
   these factors in establishing grassland communities through manipulation
   experiments conducted in both winter and summer in glasshouse
   conditions. Manipulations consisted of addition of aboveground and
   below-ground herbivores, reduction of herbivory through use of an
   insecticide, and varying of competitive pressure by removing either
   dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous seedlings as they appeared. In the
   winter experiment, the total biomass of dicotyledonous plants was
   reduced by both above-ground and belowground herbivory, while
   monocotyledonous plant biomass was unaffected. However, in the summer
   experiment, only those treatments in which competition was manipulated
   had any detectable effect. This suggests that the relative importance of
   competition and herbivory can vary considerably. The above-ground
   herbivory treatment sometimes stimulated and sometimes reduced plant
   species diversity, and sometimes also induced significantly higher
   dicotyledonous species diversity than the root herbivory treatment.
   Those treatments in which competitive pressure was manipulated had no
   detectable effects on diversity. There were many strong effects detected
   when plant species were considered individually, with different species
   responding to different treatments, and with all treatments affecting at
   least some species. Different species therefore respond quite
   differently to competition and herbivory. None of the treatments
   affected soil microbial activity or active soil microbial biomass in the
   winter experiment, although active biomass was significantly positively
   correlated with dicotyledonous plant biomass. In the summer experiment,
   soil activity was positively affected by monocotyledonous plants, while
   active biomass was the same in all treatments except for the treatment
   with all plants removed, where biomass was less. None of the soil biotic
   variables showed any relationship with plant species richness. Our study
   shows that competition and herbivory can both exert important influences
   at both the community and ecosystem levels of resolution.}},

Abstract = {{I address the selection of plants with different characteristics by
   herbivores of different body sizes by incorporating allometric
   relationships for herbivore foraging into optimal foraging models
   developed for herbivores. Herbivores may use two criteria in maximizing
   their nutritional intake when confronted with a range of food resources:
   a minimum digestibility and a minimum cropping rate. Minimum
   digestibility should depend on plant chemical characteristics and
   minimum cropping rate should depend on the density of plant items and
   their size (mass). If herbivores do select for these plant
   characteristics, then herbivores of different body sizes should select
   different ranges of these characteristics due to allometric
   relationships in digestive physiology, cropping ability and nutritional
   demands. This selectivity follows a regular pattern such that a
   herbivore of each body size can exclusively utilize some plants, while
   it must share other plants with herbivores of other body sizes. I
   empirically test this hypothesis of herbivore diet selectivity and the
   pattern of resource use that it produces in the held and experimentally.
   The findings have important implications for competition among
   herbivores and their population and community ecology. Furthermore, the
   results may have general applicability to other types of foragers, with
   general implications for how biodiversity is influenced.}},

Abstract = {{Winter samples from 0-30 cm soil depth in ungrazed native and improved

   10,418,000 m(-2) respectively. Some 60 nematode taxa were distinguished,
   and there were marked changes in the taxonomic composition of the fauna.
   The absence of cultivation and mammalian grazing reduced possibilities
   for invasion by new nematode taxa. While loss of plant-feeding species
   and marked increase in microbial-feeding species significantly decreased
   species richness (SR = 4.27-3.03 and 3.30-2.48 in 0-10 and 10-20 cm
   soil, respectively), there were no significant changes in diversity (H')
   of the nematode fauna following pasture improvement. Changes in the
   composition of the nematode fauna were reflected in declines in the
   maturity index (Sigma MI); this supports a close relationship between
   nematode activity and nutrient cycling.}},

Journal = {{NATURAL AREAS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{292-296}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Conservationists seeking to define `'old growth'' usually conceptualize
   stands on a continuum from relatively young to relatively old and often
   add a second continuum from relatively disturbed by humans to relatively
   undisturbed. Whether or not these two continua are characterized by
   ecological thresholds that differentiate old growth has important
   implications for conservation strategies. We examined published
   literature for patterns of net primary production, biomass, gap size and
   percent of stand in gaps, volume of coarse woody debris, and species
   richness and composition for both flora and fauna and found no clear
   thresholds beyond which a forest becomes old growth. Similarly, no
   thresholds of disturbance were evident, especially if one accepts the
   idea that the impact of a disturbance would diminish through time (e.g.,
   a selection cut 10 years ago might have more impact than the clearing of
   a forest for pasture 300 years ago). In the absence of clear thresholds,
   definitions of old growth are arbitrary. From a conservation
   perspective, this arbitrariness means one should use care in crafting
   definitions that are neither too narrow (which could define current old
   growth out of existence) nor too broad (which would leave protection
   efforts without useful priorities).}},

Abstract = {{Introduced pasture plants are a serious threat to Australia's
   ecosystems. Five of Australia's worst environmental weeds are tropical
   pasture grasses and 2 are shrubs introduced for shade and fodder. The

   introduced for sowing pastures have invaded national parks and natural
   ecosystems. The effects of vigorous exotic grasses in altering the fire
   regime, thus adversely affecting biodiversity, are discussed. Exotic
   grasses used in ponded pastures eliminate habitat for native fish. Woody
   legumes and twining legumes also pose a grave threat.
   Sown pastures frequently decline or fail because of run-down, marginal
   land, pest attack, or overgrazing. In these situations, new exotic
   pasture plants are wrongly promoted as the solution. Lower grazing
   pressures are likely to be more sustainable in the longer term.
   Because of the deleterious effects of exotic grasses, and twining and
   woody legumes, there is no justification for further introduction.
   Research should be directed towards developing native legumes and
   grasses, as a resource for the grazing industries.}},

Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{In the first part of this paper data are presented on the habitat
   segregation of the reptile species of Lake Prespa National Park. Twenty
   species of reptiles are present in the study area. Most of them are of
   East-Mediterranean origin, some are Balkan endemics and a few are of
   northern origin. Systematic surveys and counts of reptiles were
   conducted in each of the following habitats: marshes and reedbeds, wet
   meadows, rocky coastal areas and sandy beaches, cultivated land, grazing
   lands, mixed deciduous, oak and beech forests, sub-alpine and alpine
   meadows. A list is provided of the typical reptile species occurring in
   each of these habitats, with notes on abundance and habits. The highest
   reptilian diversity was found in man-made/modified habitats, namely the
   farmland zone, which structurally is the more diversified. There was a
   dramatic fall of species richness with increasing altitude. The second
   part of the paper describes qualitative differences in habitat
   utilization among the members of the two major reptilian groups, lizards
   and snakes. The Sand Lizard Lacerta agilis is found exclusively in the
   alpine and subalpine grasslands above 1600 m. asl., the Common Wall
   Lizard Podarcis muralis is the more euryecous while all other Lacertids
   show a clear specialization in habitat use though retaining various
   degrees of overlap. Among snakes the Adder Vipera berus is restricted to
   high mountain grasslands, the two Natrix species are common and more or
   less confined to areas close to the lakes while the Nose-horned Viper
   Vipera anmmodytes the third commonest species of the area prefers
   rocky/stony slopes. The notes on habitat utilization by the remaining
   species of snakes are only of indicative value because of small number
   of observations.}},

Journal = {{HYDROBIOLOGIA}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{351}},
Pages = {{175-196}},
Month = {{AUG 22}},
Abstract = {{The present article describes the human activities in the area and their
   changes and trends, given that the contemporary nature conservation key
   issues are closely related to past and present socio-economic and
   cultural conditions, both within Prespa itself and outside of it. The
   liberation of Prespa, a remote and rather socially isolated borderline
   area, from Ottoman occupation took place in 1912-13. Recent events in
   its environmental history have been forest clearings and human
   depopulation in the Civil War (1944-49), irrigation system construction
   in the 1960s, its `discovery' by ornithologists in the late 1960s, the
   high emigration rates of 1960-1980, its designation as a National Park
   in 1974, the destructive development works of 1984-86 after Greece's
   entry to the EEC and the conversion to intensive bean cultivation in the
   mid 1980s.
   The human population of ca 7000 at the start of this century suffered an
   almost 80\% decrease after the Civil War. A resettlement in the mid
   1950s increased the population by 40\% but in the 1970s emigration
   reduced it to its previous size of around 1500, still its present size.
   The extensive and diverse farming systems of previous centuries changed
   gradually after the construction of an irrigation network in the 1960s,
   which twenty years later and along with international changes in
   production and economy patterns, made possible the present day
   domination of a bean monoculture within irrigated croplands. This was
   accompanied by increased energy inputs, mechanisation and the use of
   chemicals. Intensification of agriculture brought increased incomes
   which attracted also livestock keepers, resulting in a 56\% decrease in
   numbers of livestock in 1964-1993. Cattle are presently kept for meat
   production only. They graze on the mountains, and no longer in the
   meadows around the lakeshore. A local shorthorn breed accounting for
   93\% of all cattle in 1963 declined to less than 18\% in 1993. Fishing
   aimed mainly at carp and Prespa bleak, continues today as in the past to
   be a source of supplementary income. Eighty-six per cent of the mainly
   oak and beech-forests are State owned and the rest belong to local
   municipalities. The forest area has not changed essentially in the last
   40 years, but forest roads have expanded. Forests provide mainly
   fuelwood for local needs and small quantities of industrial timber. No
   specific management is conducted to safeguard the conservation values of
   the forest, the majority of which consists of even aged coppiced stands
   with limited value for wildlife. Manufacturing never played an important
   role for the economy of the area. Tourism has increased in the last 20
   years, concentrated mainly in summer and spring. Accommodation in the
   villages is not yet satisfactory though it has improved enormously in
   recent years. The National Park's infrastructure for visitors remains
   poor. Tourist pressure generally is not yet that high to impact
   drastically the social and environmental fabric. In places, hunting,
   angling and poaching cad negatively affect the target species. The
   construction of the irrigation network in the eastern part of Lake Mikri
   Prespa was the most important change to the landscape and the habitats
   of Prespa the last 30 years. It resulted in the embankment of
   free-flowing streams, drainage of wet meadows and dramatic reduction of
   trees and hedges. In the last 15 years, the reedbeds, no longer burnt ar
   mowed and assisted by increased nutrient loadings from agricultural
   runoff, have expanded landward to occupy formerly open, periodically
   flooded, areas. The above changes in habitats and land use have brought
   an impoverishment of biodiversity which can be seen in the extermination
   or the decrease in the numbers of certain plant and bird species.
   The problems preventing a better management of the National Park and the
   perpetuation of its values are inappropriate legislation, the poor
   degree of coordination of the public services, the lack of both a
   specific National Park Service in Greece and a management authority for
   the Park and the hostile attitude of local people due to their limited
   information and involvement. The scenic beauty, the wetlands and a
   number of rare habitats, the diversity of habitats, flora and fauna, the
   endemic life forms, the rare mammals and the colonial waterbirds, the
   local architecture and the cultural expressions such as the Byzantine
   monuments, are the values of Prespa that must be preserved as a whole.
   The initial conservation efforts aimed at preserving biodiversity but
   later it became apparent that not only are humans an inseparable part of
   the whole, but additionally, several of their extensive activities have
   contributed substantially to the rich biodiversity of the area. Through
   the prerequisites of keeping a balance between primary and tertiary
   sector activities and of revitalizing the social fabric, the following
   are the key management and conservation issues of today: an unequivocal
   agreement on the values to be preserved and their limits; the formation
   of a management authority; a new realistic protection and land use
   zoning; the diversification and extensification of all fanning
   activities; the restoration of the wet meadow habitats; the ensuring of
   a high water level and a good water quality for both lakes through
   tri-lateral cooperation between Greece, Albania and FYROM; and the
   establishment of a permanent environmental monitoring scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Twenty sites, representing different pasture types in NW Spain, were
   sampled with respect to their floristic composition and structural
   characteristics for two years of contrasting precipitation. The first
   year was characterised by a severe regional drought and the second year
   had normal precipitation. Four plant community types were identified by
   consensus classification techniques of plant species composition. These
   community types were associated with grazing regime, percentage cover of
   herbaceous vegetation, rocks and bare ground, and soil characteristics.
   One community type included mesic sites on acidic parent materials with
   low grazing, whereas the other three were all intensely,orated, and
   included either xeric or mesic sites on calcareous parent materials, or
   mesic sites on acidic parent materials. Species composition varied
   between years according to well defined directional trends within the
   intensely grazed communities. Compositional differences between
   calcareous and acidic pastures increased in the normal year. On average
   49 to 73\% of the species appeared only in one year. This high species
   turnover was also high when analysed separately for different
   life-forms, namely annuals, perennial grasses, perennial forbs and
   undershrubs. In spite of this, both the life-form spectrum, and the
   relative abundance of each life-form remained unaltered for each
   community type in both years. This suggests that such characteristics of
   the communities' structure are in equilibrium with habitat
   characteristics, as well as the existence of a deterministic structure
   in the grasslands studied.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of grazing cattle on vegetation was studied on a natural
   pasture during the rainy and dry seasons of 1995 in the Ethiopian
   highlands. The study used 0.01 ha plots, established on 0-4\% and 4-8\%
   slopes located close to each other at Debre Zeit research station, 50 km
   South of Addis Ababa. The grazing regimes were: light grazing stocked at
   0.6 animal-unit-month per hectare (AUM ha(-1)); moderate grazing stocked
   at 1.8 AUM ha(-1); heavy grazing stocked at 3.0 AUM ha(-1); very heavy
   grazing stocked at 4.2 AUM ha(-1); very heavy grazing on ploughed
   pasture stocked at 4.2 AUM ha(-1); and a control of `no grazing'. Heavy
   grazing significantly reduced vegetative cover and biomass yields,
   especially on steeper slopes, Light to heavy grazing did not affect the
   botanical composition of the vegetation at both sites, but very heavy
   grazing resulted in species normally less preferred by animals
   dominating the botanical composition. Grazing did not have significant
   effect on ground vegetative cover on the 0-4\% slope except at very
   heavy grazing pressure, but on the 4-8\% slope even moderate grazing
   significantly reduced vegetative cover. Light to moderate grazing at the
   beginning of the dry period enhanced plant biomass productivity, while
   any grazing reduced plant productivity during the periods of reduced
   growth. Species richness increased with increasing grazing pressure
   compared with no grazing, but decreased sharply at very heavy grazing
   pressure. We concluded that there is need for developing `slope and time
   specific' grazing management practices, and to assess short and long
   term effects of grazing and trampling on vegetation. (C) 1997 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This experiment studied the effects of sheep grazing a formerly
   fertilized lowland neutral grassland near Oxford in southern England at
   different intensities and times of year on sheep production, the flora
   and invertebrates. The aim was to identify regimes that enhanced
   species-richness while also supporting average levels of sheep
   production. Grazing in either winter or spring increased the number of
   plant species the following summer and autumn. However the soil seed
   bank largely consisted of species common in the sward or of weeds from
   adjacent arable crops, so diversification requires an external seed
   source. Sward heights were monitored weekly in summer and sheep numbers
   adjusted to achieve either high (6 cm) or low (3 cm) target sward
   heights. There were generally more invertebrates in paddocks grazed to a
   target sward height of 6 cm rather than 3 cm in summer, but not as many
   as in adjacent, ungrazed grassland. Target sward heights took longer to
   achieve and swards were more heterogeneous when grazing had not occurred
   in the previous season. Sward surface height measurements are a
   potentially useful tool for linking nature conservation and livestock
   management. In this experiment sheep weights in summer and autumn were
   higher when swards were grazed in either the previous winter or spring.

Abstract = {{Changes of the ground-layer vegetation between 1983 and 1993 were
   studied on permanent oak forest plots in Skane and eastern Smaland, two
   regions of South Sweden rich in oak but with different climatic
   conditions. 79 of the 123 more common species differed considerably in
   frequency between Skane and Smaland. The oak forests in Skane contained
   more typical forest species, whereas the number of light-demanding
   grassland species was higher in Smaland. Almost half of the more common
   species showed significant changes in frequency between 1983 and 1993.
   Several species of clearings and some light-demanding grassland species
   increased their frequency in Skane. They were probably favoured by
   canopy thinning which occurred in 65 out of 95 permanent plots. Only two
   species decreased in frequency in Skane, but 14 species showed a
   decrease in Smaland. All were typical grassland species and their
   decline may be regarded as a long-term response to ceased grazing and
   tree canopy closure as almost no tree cutting occurred during the study
   period in Smaland. Total species richness increased with management
   intensity in Skane. This was due to decreasing species losses and
   increasing establishment of new species at intense management. A small
   general increase in species numbers was recorded in Smaland. Species
   richness was more closely related to soil pH in Skane than in Smaland.
   The floristic variability between the oak forest plots was closely
   related to soil pH in both Skane and Smaland. We suggest that changes of
   light conditions as a result of changes in forest management are
   important for current secondary succession in South Swedish oak forests,
   whereas the general floristic pattern is to a large extent controlled by
   soil acidity.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Studies to identify gaps in the protection of habitat for species of
   concern have been inconclusive and hampered by single-scale or poor
   multi-scale sampling methods, large minimum mapping units (MMU's of 2 ha
   to 100 ha), limited and subjectively selected field observations, and
   poor mathematical and ecological models. We overcome these obstacles
   with improved multi-scale sampling techniques, smaller MMU's (< 0.02
   ha), an unbiased sampling design based on double sampling, improved
   mathematical models including species-area curves corrected for habitat
   heterogeneity and geographic information system-based ecological models.
   We apply this landscape analysis approach to address resource issues in
   Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Specifically, we quantify the
   effects of elk grazing on plant diversity, identify areas of high or
   unique plant diversity needing increased protection, and evaluate the
   patterns of non-native plant species on the landscape.
   Double sampling techniques use satellite imagery, aerial photography,
   and field data to stratify homogeneous and heterogeneous units and
   `'keystone ecosystems'' (ecosystems that contain or support a high
   number of species or have distinctive species compositions). We show how
   a multi-scale vegetation sampling design, species-area curves, analyses
   of within-and between-vegetation type species overlap, and geographic
   information system (GIS) models can be used to quantify landscape-scale
   patterns of vascular plant diversity in the Park.
   The new multi-scale vegetation plot techniques quickly differentiated
   plant species differences in paired study sites, Three plots in the
   Ouzel Burn area (burned in 1978) contained 75 plant species, while only
   17 plant species were found in paired plots outside the burn. Riparian
   areas contained 109 plant species, compared to just 55 species in paired
   plots in adjacent forests. However, plant species richness patterns
   inside and outside elk exclosures were more complex, One elk exclosure
   contained more species than its adjacent open range (52 species inside
   and 48 species outside). Two elk exclosures contained fewer species
   inside than outside (105 and 41 species inside and 112 and 74 species
   outside, respectively). However, there was only 26\% to 48\% overlap
   (using Jaccard's Coefficient) of plant species composition inside and
   outside the exclosures. One elk exclosure had 13\% cover of
   non-indigenous species inside the exclosure compared to 4\% outside, but
   non-indigenous species cover varied by location.
   We compared plant diversity patterns from vegetation maps made with 100
   ha, 50 ha, 2 ha, and 0.02 ha MMU's in the 754 ha Beaver Meadows study
   area using four 0.025 ha and twenty-one 0.1 ha multi-scale vegetation
   plots. Preliminary data suggested that the 2 ha MMU provided an accurate
   estimate of the number of plant species (-14\%) for a study area, but
   the number of habitats (polygons) was reduced by 67\%, and aspen, a
   unique and important habitat type, was missed entirely, We describe a
   hypothesis-driven approach to the design and implementation of
   geospatial databases for local resource monitoring and ecosystem
   management.}},

Journal = {{OECOLOGIA}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{110}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence. longevity, and contribution of axillary bud banks to
   population maintenance were investigated in a late-seral perennial
   grass, Bouteloua curtipendula, and a mid-seral perennial grass, Hilaria
   belangeri, in a semiarid oak-juniper savanna. Axillary buds of both
   species were evaluated over a 2-year period in communities with
   contrasting histories of grazing by domestic herbivores. A double
   staining procedure utilizing triphenyl tetrazolium chloride and Evan's
   blue indicated that both viable and dormant axillary buds remained
   attached to the base of reproductive parental tillers for 18-24 months
   which exceeded parental tiller longevity by approximately 12 months. Bud
   longevity of the late-seral species, B. curtipendula exceeded bud
   longevity of the mid-seral species, H. belangeri, by approximately 6
   months. Younger buds located on the distal portion of the tiller base
   were 3.2 and 1.4 times more likely to grow out than older proximal buds
   of B. curtipendula and H. belangeri, respectively. The percentage of
   older proximal buds, which included comparable portions of viable and
   dormant buds, that grew out to produce tillers following mortality of
   parental tillers was 6.0\% for B. curtipendula and 8.4\% for H.
   belangeri. In spite of the occurrence of relative large axillary bud
   banks for both species, the magnitude of proximal bud growth did not
   appear sufficient to maintain viable tiller populations. We found no
   evidence to support the hypothesis of compensatory bud growth on an
   individual tiller basis for either species. Grazing history of the
   communities from which the buds were collected did not substantially
   affect the number, status, longevity, or outgrowth of axillary buds on
   an individual tiller basis for either species. However, long-term
   grazing by domestic herbivores influenced axillary bud availability by
   modifying population structure of these two species. Bud number per
   square meter for B. curtipendula was 25\% lower in the long-term grazed
   compared to the long-term ungrazed community based on a reduction in
   both tiller number per plant and plant number per square meter. In
   contrast, bud number per square meter for H. belangeri was 190\% greater
   in the long-term grazed than in the long-term ungrazed community based
   on a large increase in plant density per square meter. Minimal
   contributions of axillary bud banks to annual maintenance of tiller
   populations in this mid- and late-seral species underscores the
   ecological importance of consistent tiller recruitment from recently
   developed axillary buds. Consistent tiller recruitment in grasslands and
   savannas characterized by intensive grazing and periodic drought implies
   that (I) bud differentiation and maturation must be remarkably tolerant
   of adverse environmental conditions and/or (2) tiller recruitment may
   resume from buds that mature following the cessation of severe drought
   and/or grazing, rather than from mature buds that survive these
   disturbances. These scenarios warrant additional research emphasis given
   the critical importance of this demographic process to tiller
   replacement in species populations and the maintenance of relative
   species abundance in grasslands and savannas.}},

Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{222-230}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. As part of a long-term study of the effects of elevated CO2 on
   biodiversity and ecosystem function in a calcareous grassland, we
   measured ecosystem carbon dioxide and water-vapour fluxes over 24-h
   periods during the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons. Data were used to
   derive CO2 and H2O gas-exchange response functions to quantum flux
   density (QFD).
   2. The relative increase in net ecosystem CO2 flux (NEC) owing to CO2
   enrichment increased as QFD rose. Daytime NEC at high QFD under elevated
   CO2 increased by 25\% to 60\%, with the greatest increases in the spring
   and after mowing in June when above-ground biomass was lowest. There was
   much less stimulation of NEC in early June and again in October when the
   canopy was fully developed. Night-time NEC was not significantly altered
   under elevated CO2.
   3. Short-term reversal of CO2 concentrations between treatments after
   two seasons of CO2 exposure provided evidence for a 50\% downward
   adjustment of NEC expressed per unit above-ground plant dry weight.
   However, when expressed on a land area basis, this difference
   disappeared because of a c. 20\% increase in above-ground biomass under
   elevated CO2.
   4. Ecosystem evapotranspiration (ET) was not significantly altered by
   elevated CO2 when averaged over all measurement dates and positions.
   However, ET was reduced 3-18\% at high QFD in plots at the top of the
   slope at our study site. In summary, CO2 enrichment resulted in a large
   stimulation of ecosystem CO2 capture, especially during periods of a
   large demand of carbon in relationship to its supply, and resulted in a
   relatively small and variable effect on ecosystem water consumption.}},

   varied grazing regimes on upland Nardus stricta grasslands}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{34}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{1. The effect of different livestock grazing regimes on the insect fauna
   of an upland, semi-natural grassland was measured in 1993 and 1994 by a
   survey of the epigeal Carabidae and Staphylinidae within an experiment
   established in 1991. Grazing by sheep, or sheep and cattle, to achieve
   two different inter-tussock sward heights, provided four treatments. In
   addition, a further treatment was ungrazed from 1992 to test the impact
   on beetles of a short-term cessation of grazing, trampling and dung
   inputs.
   2. Pitfall traps sampled Carabidae and Staphylinidae within the Nardus
   stricta-dominated grassland of the experiment. Data on these epigeal
   Coleoptera were collected from April to October in 1993 and 1994; years
   three and four of the experiment.
   3. The epigeal Coleoptera species were ranked by decreasing abundance in
   traps, where the captures in traps were accumulated for both seasons.
   The responses to the grazing regimes were analyzed using ANOVA, applied
   to the most abundant species (that together represented 99\% of the two
   seasons' catch). There were significant experimental effects of grazing
   regime on five of these 32 Coleoptera species, namely Carabus violaceus,
   Othius angustus, Pterostichus strenuus, Xantholinus linearis and
   Olophrum piceum.
   4. The ordination technique, Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA),
   was applied to the data on the Coleoptera assemblage. Variables measured
   to represent the experimental treatments (mean vegetation height,
   stocking rate and botanical diversity) and environmental covariables
   (altitude and aspect) were entered in the direct gradient analysis
   procedure of CCA. This application of CCA partialled out the effects of
   altitude and aspect of each plot and revealed the significant effects of
   vegetation structure, botanical species composition and stocking density
   on a larger number of Coleoptera species than suggested from ANOVA.
   5. Twenty-four of the 32 most abundant Coleoptera species correlated
   with the effects of different grazing regimens imposed on Nardus
   grassland. Greater abundances of C. violaceus, O. angustus, X. linearis
   and T. corticinus were indicative of the typical upland grassland and
   heathland Coleoptera assemblage. These species could be monitored to
   balance the impact of grazing management on arthropod biodiversity with
   the need to restrict the dominance of N. stricta in drier upland
   grasslands, achieved in this instance, by summer grazing sheep and
   cattle to maintain an average, between-tussock sward height of 6-7 cm.
   However, the results from the direct gradient analysis suggest that the
   grazing regimes should be varied in rotation over time to achieve a
   mosaic of structurally different grassland patches (0.70-4.73 ha)
   because this encourages a larger overall number of beetle species.}},

Abstract = {{Most hypotheses addressing the effect of diversity on ecosystem function
   indicate the occurrence of higher process rates with increasing
   diversity, and only diverge in the shape of the function depending on
   their assumptions about the role of individual species and functional
   groups. Contrarily to these predictions, we show that grazing of the
   Flooding Pampas grasslands increased species richness, but drastically
   reduced above ground net primary production, even when communities with
   similar initial biomass were compared. Grazing increased species
   richness through the addition of a number of exotic forbs, without
   reducing the richness and cover of the native flora. Since these forbs
   were essentially cool-season species, and also because their
   introduction has led to the displacement of warm-season grasses from
   dominant to subordinate positions in the community, grazing not only
   decreased productivity, but also shifted its seasonality towards the
   cool season. These results suggest that species diversity and/or
   richness alone are poor predictors of above-ground primary production.
   Therefore, models that relate productivity to diversity should take into
   account the relative abundance and identity of species that are added or
   deleted by the specific disturbances that modify diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The size and dynamics of seed banks were studied in grazed and ungrazed
   Mediterranean pastures at different altitudes and topography positions.
   The soil samples were collected in autumn and spring and the seed banks
   composition was determined by greenhouse germination over a 9-month
   period. The percentage of bare ground and the presence of new seedlings
   were recorded monthly from October to July in the field.
   A fall in seed density and species richness in the banks and a tendency
   for seeds to remain in the banks were linked to a rise in altitude.
   Germination in lower pastures mainly occurred in October in the numerous
   gaps left by the summer drought. At higher altitudes, the scarcity of
   gaps and the harsh climate led to an autumn-spring segregation of
   germination. On a local scale, the low slope positions and the ungrazed
   plots had a. larger number of persistent seed bank species and a lower
   percentage of bare ground where seeds could germinate than their
   respective plots in the upper positions and grazed plots. A higher seed
   density in ungrazed than grazed plots was only detected in the three
   highest plots. No seed bank species richness trend was detected.
   In populations of the same species in different types of environments,
   the seasonal variation of seed numbers was environment-dependent for the
   majority of the species. In general, perennial grassland and its related
   low gaps availability appear to favour persistent seed banks.}},

Abstract = {{The distribution, density acid cover of small-scale natural disturbances
   was surveyed in semi-natural and set-aside vegetation in a hilly
   landscape in Central Germany in the spring of 1995. More of the
   landscape was disturbed on set-aside agricultural land in valleys (1.02
   \%) and on warm south-facing slopes (1.33 \%) than on rocky hilltops
   (0.3 \%) and cool north-facing slopes (0.56 \%). The major agents of
   disturbance on set-aside fields were moles, rodents (and their
   predators) and wild boars. In surrounding semi-natural grasslands,
   rabbit warrens were common on south-facing slopes and mound-building
   ants on north-facing slopes. Disturbances were significantly clustered
   and frequently superimposed.
   In order to investigate the effects of disturbance quality on plant
   assemblages in set-aside fields, two common types of disturbances were
   compared. These were grazing lawns (0.4 - 1.0 m(2)) maintained
   throughout the summer by common voles (Microtus arvalis), and
   excavations, 0.7 - 1.6 m(2) in area, where wild boars (Sus scrofa)
   grubbing for food had removed vegetation and top soil in early spring.
   Both types of disturbances increased plant species richness on the local
   scale. Wind-dispersed annual and pauciennial forbs of ruderal habitats
   (e.g. Carduus acanthoides, Cirsium vulgare, Matricaria maritima, Senecio
   vernalis) were most abundant on the superficial disturbances made by
   voles, whereas small, ephemeral field weeds (e.g. Polygonum aviculare,
   Anagallis arvensis, Chenopodium album, Fallopia convolvulus)
   predominated on patches grubbed by boars.
   This study confirms that small-scale disturbances by animals provide a
   variety of regeneration niches for field weeds and ruderals. The rate of
   decline in plant species richness on set-aside land is likely to be
   reduced where land is utilized by a variety of herbivorous and
   soil-moving mammals.}},

Journal = {{ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Alpine grassland at 2 470 m altitude in the Swiss Central Alps was
   exposed to elevated CO2 by using open top chambers (16 ambient, 16
   elevated CO2). Some plots received mineral fertilizer at a rate of
   N-deposition commonly measured in low altitude parts of Europe. Here we
   present a summary of results and data from the final harvest.
   Above-ground biomass measured after the completion of growth in the
   fourth season of treatment was not affected by CO2 enrichment as was
   found by previous biometric estimates, but mean below-ground biomass was
   slightly stimulated (+ 12\%, n.s.). In con trast, net CO2 uptake per
   unit land area was strongly stimulated by CO2 enrichment al the
   beginning of the experiment, and during the early part of each season.
   However, the CO2 stimulation decreased during the later part of each
   growing season. By year four, also mid-season differences in CO2 uptake
   per unit land area had disappeared. Neither microbial biomass, soil
   respiration in the laboratory, nor in situ land-area-based CO2 evolution
   during the 10 week growing season increased under elevated CO2. The
   total biomass N-pool and free soil nitrate and ammonium (capture by ion
   exchange resin bags) remained unaffected, whereas leaf nitrogen
   concentration was reduced and nonstructural carbohydrate concentration
   increased under elevated CO2 in forbs. These differences in tissue
   composition largely disappeared during senescence and litter formation.
   Despite low CO2 responsiveness at ecosystem level, species responses
   differed in terms of nitrogen, carbohydrates, tillering and flowering,
   suggesting the possibility for long-term changes in community structure.
   Addition of NPK equivalent to 40 kg N ha(-1) a(-1) had massive effects
   on all plant traits studied, but did not enable stimulated growth under
   CO2 enrichment. However, when fertilizer and CO2 enrichment were
   provided jointly, soil microbes were stimulated indicating a
   co-limitation by carbon and nutrients (most likely nitrogen). Since
   responses to elevated CO2 were absent in both warm and cold growing
   seasons, we conclude that this late successional plant community is
   carbon saturated at current atmospheric CO2 concentrations for reasons
   not directly related to nutrient supply and climate. Perhaps, contrary
   to our expectation, evolutionary adjustments of this `'old'' ecosystem
   to the life conditions at high altitudes caused carbon to become a
   surplus resource today.}},

Abstract = {{We present a synthesis of two independent glasshouse experiments in
   which we investigated the short term response of model communities of
   calcareous grassland species to CO2-enrichment. Communities consisted of
   six species in the first study and of 14 species in-the second study.
   Communities were grown in containers filled with ca. 20 liters of
   natural soil. Total aboveground biomass production was increased by 14\%
   (n.s., p=0.21) in the first study and by 8.5\% (p=0.03) in the second
   study. This community level response was due to a significant
   stimulation of growth in 2 and 5 species, respectively. In each of the
   experiments, one species responded negatively to CO2-enrichment. The
   remaining species, including all legumes, remained unaffected by
   CO2-enrichment. Positive or negative responding species did not belong
   to specific functional groups, hence responses could not have been
   predicted from a priori knowledge of individual plant traits. Bromus
   erectus, which is the dominant species in calcareous grasslands of the
   Jura mountains, did not exhibit a CO2-response at the species level, but
   genotype-specific responses in this species varied significantly and
   included positive as well as negative responses. No such genotypic
   differentiation of CO2-response was observed in Fes tuca ovina. In the
   long term, we expect directional selection of positively responding
   genotypes and shifts in species composition to alter both population and
   community structure of calcareous grass lands - a conclusion that may
   also hold for other diverse plant communities.}},

Abstract = {{The richness of vascular plant species in four grazed and five ungrazed

   the town of Pori (61 degrees 30'-61 degrees 33'N, 21 degrees 28'-21

   in 412 1-m(2) plots and in the adjacent areas. The flora included a
   total of 183 vascular plant species representing 108 genera. The shore
   plant communities were dominated by perennial monocot species, although
   the number of dicot species was higher. The vascular plant species
   richness (11.5 +/- 4.7) in 1-m(2) sample plots was significantly higher
   at the seashore than in the delta of the river Kokemaenjoki. A model is
   constructed of the factors that affect species richness in seashore
   meadows. Species richness increased significantly with increasing
   distance from the waterline, and more importantly (R-2 = 0.26) with
   elevation above the mean sea level. The linear increase in species
   richness continues up to a certain elevation, the latter being dependent
   on the amplitude of water level fluctuation. Species richness decreased
   significantly with an increase in biomass or height of vegetation. These
   variables are negatively correlated with elevation and have only
   secondary importance for species richness. In the delta area no
   significant results were obtained for species richness in general. The
   vascular plant species richness was higher in grazed plots than in
   ungrazed ones in the delta, but in the transects most exposed by the sea
   the opposite was true. The influence of grazing on the species richness
   seemed to be scale-dependent.}},

Title = {{Temperate eucalypt woodlands: a review of their status, processes
   threatening their persistence and techniques for restoration}},
Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{1997}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{949-973}},
Abstract = {{Temperate eucalypt woodlands were once widespread throughout southern
   Australia and Tasmania. Following European settlement, woodlands were
   cleared for agriculture, or grazed and converted to pasture. In the
   wheatbelts of south-western and south-eastern Australia, woodlands have
   been almost completely eliminated from the landscape with as little as
   3\% of some woodland types remaining. As a consequence, some temperate
   eucalypt woodland communities are amongst the most poorly conserved
   ecosystems in Australia. The main effect of widespread clearing and
   grazing has been the loss of habitat. This has had a devastating impact
   on the woodland flora and fauna. A number of species have become extinct
   and many are threatened; many others have undergone regional and local
   population declines. Woodlands now occur throughout much of their former
   range as remnants of varying size, quality and isolation. Many of these
   are under threat from further clearing, rising saline water tables and
   increased inundation, livestock grazing, nutrient enrichment, soil
   structural decline, altered fire regimes and the invasion of exotic
   weeds. The degradation and loss of biodiversity in temperate eucalypt
   woodlands will continue unless clearing stops and the management of
   remnants changes; this will invariably involve ecological restoration
   both at the patch and landscape level. The review discusses approaches
   to restoration and reveals that there are few data in the published
   literature describing techniques for reversing degrading processes and
   restoring diversity structure and function in remnant woodlands. This
   information is urgently needed. Past research on temperate eucalypt
   woodlands has focused on identifying the processes of degradation and
   these are now relatively well documented. There is a need to shift the
   focus of research to developing solutions for these problems.}},

Abstract = {{To assess the biodiversity potential of an ungrazed and a grazed inland
   salt meadow in the Seewinkel (Eastern Austria), spider assemblages were
   recorded by pitfall trapping for 1 year. Both species assemblages
   consisted, to a large extent, of rare species of conservation interest.
   The species assemblage of the grazed site was dominated by Pardosa
   agrestis, but highly specific halotopobiontic species also occurred in
   higher numbers. Halotolerant species were also present in the ungrazed
   meadow, but their individual number was much lower. The species
   composition of this site reflects the more balanced microclimatical
   situation of the high sward. Comparison of the two assemblages with 207
   other meadow spider assemblages of Central Europe shows a separated
   position, especially of the grazed site assemblage. High similarities
   with assemblages of meadows with a similar vegetation structure indicate
   a high importance of management. Considering the high proportion of rare
   species on both sites, the best management of the salt meadow and pan
   shores of the Seewinkel should combine areas of light grazing with
   ungrazed areas. However, the proportion of these parts and the intensity
   of grazing still remains to be determined by quantitative experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The disappearance of grazing from much of British lowland heathland over
   the last century is thought to be a major contributory factor in the
   loss of heath vegetation by allowing succession towards woodland. The
   reintroduction of grazing is hindered by the small amount of available
   information on grazing management methods or on the responses of lowland
   heath vegetation to grazing. We review a range of grazing management
   methods (different grazing animals, stocking rates and combination with
   burning or cutting) and their effects on vegetation in a number of
   different lowland heath types (dry, humid and wet heath, and mire)
   distributed across southern England. The introduction of grazing or
   higher stocking rates generally increased plant species richness, and
   the cover of grasses, forbs, bryophytes and lichens and bare ground
   while reducing litter depth and the cover of dwarf shrubs and scrub
   species. However, precise effects on species composition varied widely
   between sites and grazing managements. The desirability of each of these
   effects is discussed in relation to the need to specify management
   objectives. Copyright (C) 1996 Published by Elsevier Science Limited}},

   extension for Paratheridula perniciosa. Ceraticelus emertoni and Neriene
   redacta are also reported from Georgia for the first time. The
   proportional distribution of pitfall-trapped species within families
   does not differ significantly from that reported for Berry's (1966)
   pitfall trapping in the North Carolina Piedmont (about 450 km away),
   suggesting regional similarity of the Piedmont ground-layer spider
   fauna. Data on phenology and relative catch of species among the four
   habitats sampled (conventional and no-tillage agricultural fields,
   grassy field borders, and the surrounding deciduous riparian forest) are
   given for the most abundant species. Habitat selection of 15 abundant
   species was statistically analyzed; most of the species' populations
   displayed strong preferences for particular habitats. It is clear that
   species ``spillover{''} from adjacent habitats contributes to the faunal
   richness of each habitat, and that maintenance of a mosaic of habitats

Abstract = {{In limestone grasslands in northern Switzerland some factors which cause
   fluctuations of species' dominance (cover) were investigated. It was
   assessed whether these fluctuations contribute to the coexistence of up
   to 40 different plant species per square metre. Weather fluctuations,
   particularly drought years, and irregularities of the mowing date are
   causes of the so-called exogenic fluctuations of species abundance.
   Endogenic fluctuations are e.g. those caused by the turnover rate of the
   populations and by the changes of population density of the common vole
   (Microtus arvalis Pall.). Examples for plant species favoured or
   inhibited by these different fluctuations are given. The fluctuations
   and their interferences mean that no species encounters optimal growth
   conditions for a prolonged period of time. Therefore no species can
   outcompete the others. Fluctuations are thus decisive for the
   coexistence of species. Other ecosystem structures and functions
   contributing to coexistence are mentioned.}},

Abstract = {{Effects of forest management and soil acidity on herb layer vegetation
   were studied after 10 years on 190 permanent plots in south Swedish
   beech (Fagus sylvatica) and oak (Quercus robur) forests. Species
   richness generally increased with management intensity, mainly due to
   establishment of ruderal species from the seed bank. Species richness of
   the typical forest flora was unaffected by management. Moderate
   management of oak stands favoured several species which are commonly
   found in semi-natural pastures. Classification and ordination of the
   data showed that the main floristic gradient within Swedish beech and
   oak forest vegetation is related to soil acidity. Species richness of
   the typical forest flora was strongly positively correlated with soil pH
   in beech forests, but this correlation was weaker in oak forests. The
   number of herbaceous plants with a broader habitat range increased with
   pH only in the oak forest plots. Long term changes in the forest
   environment, which may affect the vegetation, are the decline of grazing
   150-50 years ago and soil acidification mainly caused by atmospheric
   pollutants during the last 50 years. In the one-decade perspective of
   this study, however, we did not find a general vend towards a more
   acid-tolerant flora. Neither could we find a general decrease of pasture
   species in currently ungrazed oak stands. The results indicate that most
   typical forest plants are well adapted to and partly depend on
   occurrence of canopy gaps and soil disturbance. If canopy thinning is
   followed by periods of canopy closure the characteristic shade tolerant
   flora of Swedish beech and oak forests may be able to persist as long as
   soil chemical limits of existence are not exceeded.}},

Abstract = {{1. A range of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilizer
   treatments was applied for 4 years in a randomized block experiment to a
   species-rich hay meadow on peat soil, within the Somerset Moors and
   Levels Environmentally Sensitive Area.
   2. The percentage composition of each species present was recorded in
   May and October each year on plots cut for hay, followed by further cuts
   of aftermath growth. The effects on species richness, diversity and
   dominance were analysed, and ordination techniques were used to
   investigate the effects of fertilizers on plant community composition.
   Data for mean annual biomass production are also presented.
   3. Botanical results were compared with those of a concurrent experiment
   where aftermath growth was grazed.
   4. P was more important than N in determining both biomass production
   and botanical change, In both cases, the effects were small when
   substantial amounts of N and K were applied without P, but when high
   rates of P were included biomass increased very significantly and
   species diversity was severely reduced, with Holcus lanatus, Rumex
   acetosa and Lolium perenne dominating.
   5. Lolium perenne was not increased by N and modest rates of P in the
   absence of aftermath grazing, but dominated all fertilized plots when
   aftermath grazing was maintained. Agrostis canina came to dominate plots
   receiving 200 kg ha(-1) of N with modest rates of P and K in the absence
   of aftermath grazing, but was negatively associated with N where the
   aftermath was grazed.

   with nil or 25 kg ha(-1) of N each year, both with and without aftermath
   grazing, but all legumes were suppressed at high rates of N,

Abstract = {{The federal Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) funded the conversion of
   eroding cropland to grass or grass-legume cover that was not to be
   tilled, hayed, or grazed for 10 yr. It was not known what the species
   composition of CRP fields would be after years of minimal disturbance.
   Our objective was to document the presence and percentage groundcover of
   weeds in 151 CRP fields located in 10 Minnesota counties; including 108
   Conservation Practice (CP)-1 (cool-season legumes and grasses) fields,
   17 CP-2 (native grasses) fields, and 26 CP-10 (existing vegetation)
   fields. Groundcover of each species present and of bare ground was
   scored in six 106-sq-ft sample plots per field. The most prevalent
   species were the primary noxious weed Canada thistle {[}Cirsium arvense
   (L.) Scop.], the secondary noxious weed quackgrass {[}Elytrigia repens
   (L.) Desv. ex. Nevski], and the non- noxious weeds dandelion (Taraxacum
   officinale Weber.) and goldenrod (Solidago spp.). Weed percentage
   groundcover was higher in CP-10 fields than in CP-1 or CP-2 fields,
   probably because many CP-10 stands were already thinning at the start of
   the CRP contract. Volunteer legumes and grasses were common in CP-10
   fields. In CP-1 fields, legume and grass percentage groundcover usually
   was correlated negatively with weed percentage groundcover. Weed
   percentage groundcover and species richness were correlated positively
   Gopher mounding was correlated positively with the amount of bare ground
   and with the percentage groundcover of annual and biennial weed species.
   Primary, secondary, and non-noxious weeds were each found in nearly 90\%
   of the fields studied. Widespread presence of noxious weeds on CRP
   fields is a cause for concern. Weed control issues should be addressed
   in planning a new CRP.}},

Abstract = {{Fragmentation of eucalypt forests has been common in southeastern
   Australia. Urbanisation, agriculture and the establishment of
   plantations of the exotic tree Pinus radiata are major agencies of
   fragmentation. The study of the effects of these agencies on adjacent
   forested land has lacked a suitable framework. By constructing
   generalized trophic-level diagrams for each fragmenting system-farm,
   urban area and pine plantation-the major potential impacts on adjacent
   forested land can be examined. Urban areas, for example, have a
   relatively large non-native predator biomass (especially cats and dogs)
   compared with the original forest, whilst farms support a relatively
   large biomass of exotic herbivores. In pine plantations, by way of
   contrast, the biomass of native or exotic herbivores and predators is
   relatively small. Landscape fires are an integral part of the ecology of
   native eucalypt forests but are kept out of suburban areas, farms with
   improved pastures and standing plantations as much as possible. To
   explore the potential impacts on biodiversity of fire regimes in forests
   at the edges of urban areas, farms and plantations, we constructed and
   sought evidence for, a series of scenarios (each a compound hypothesis).
   Urban interface scenario: `There is a low frequency of unplanned fire in
   forest remnants. To prevent losses of life and property in adjacent
   urban areas, regular frequent prescribed burning is practiced. Regular
   frequent prescribed burning reduces biodiversity'. Support for the first
   two parts of this scenario was strong although the frequency of fires,
   prescribed or unplanned, may be a function of distance from the urban
   edge, the size of management unit and the nature of the fuels. Urban
   predators may be expected to reduce vertebrate biodiversity, especially
   after fires. Agricultural interface scenario: `Clearing for agriculture
   leaves only small forest remnants which become fire free. Fire-free
   fragments eventually decline in plant species biodiversity'. Forest
   fragments in rural areas vary widely in size and occur as roadside
   remnants, farm woodlots, Travelling Stock Reserves, State Forests and
   designated conservation reserves. The circumstances of burning vary
   widely. Grazing from domestic stock, especially combined with fire, may
   negatively affect biodiversity. Absence of fire may also reduce
   biodiversity. Pine interface scenario: `Pines spread from plantations to
   neighbouring forest areas, reducing native plant and animal species
   diversity. This situation can be reversed by a prescribed burning regime
   that has fires intense enough to cause pine death and frequent enough to
   prevent pine seed set'. There was considerable support for this scenario
   although at this stage the spread of pines may be only in areas
   peripheral to plantations. Because fires have effects on biodiversity,
   crops, lives and property in fragmented forests and adjacent areas,
   integrated management-across landuses and jurisdictions-is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Grazed and ungrazed sites subjected to different fare frequencies were
   sampled on the Konza Prairie Research Natural Area in northeast Kansas
   after 4 years of bison grazing (1987-1991), The objective was to study
   effects of bison grazing on plant species composition and diversity
   components (plant species richness, equitability, and spatial
   heterogeneity) in sites of contrasting fire frequency, Cover and
   frequency of cool-season graminoids (e.g. Poa pratensis L., Agropyron
   smithii Rydb,, Carer spp,) and some forbs (e.g. Aster ericoides {[}A,
   Gray] Howell, and Oxalis stricta L.) were consistently higher in sites
   grazed by bison than in ungrazed exclosures, whereas the dominant
   warm-season grasses (Andropogon gerardii Vitman, Sorghastrum nutans
   {[}L.] Nash, Panicum virgatum L., Schizachyrium scoparium {[}Michx.]
   Nash) and other forbs (e.g. Solidago missouriensis Nutt.) decreased in
   response to bison, Plant species diversity (H') and spatial
   heterogeneity in all areas sampled were significantly increased by
   bison, Increased heterogeneity and mean species richness in grazed
   prairie (40 species per sample site) compared to ungrazed prairie (29
   species per site) were likely a result of greater microsite diversity
   generated by bison, whereas preferential grazing of the dominant grasses
   and concomitant increases in subordinate species resulted in an increase
   in equitability of species abundances, Species/area relationships
   indicated greater effects of bison on plant species richness with
   increasing sample area, Increases in plant diversity components
   associated with bison grazing were generally greater in annually burned
   than in I-year burned sites, Effects of ungulate grazers on floristic
   diversity have important implications given recent evidence that plant
   species diversity and the compositional and production stability of
   grassland plant communities are positively related.}},

Abstract = {{Green panic (Panicum maximum var. trichoglume) and rhodes grass (Chloris
   gayana) were sown on a fertile soil in subcoastal south-east Queensland,
   Australia, and grazed at 5 stocking rates (1.0 to 2.2 steers/ha), with
   and without nitrogen fertiliser (100kg N/ha/yr). The occurrence of
   unsown species within 1m(2) quadrats on a 25m x 20m grid was monitored
   annually in summer from 1973-1980. Spatial data were analysed by cluster
   analysis and the number of species per paddock and per quadrat were
   analysed by regression and analysis of variance.
   The number of species per paddock and per quadrat was reduced by the
   application of nitrogen fertiliser. Increasing stocking rate increased
   the number of species per quadrat but not per paddock, except at the
   highest stocking rate.
   Factors affecting the composition of unsown species were, in order of
   importance, soil moisture much greater than fertiliser > stocking rate.
   Soil moisture affected the composition of unsown species in 2 ways.
   Changes in the availability of winter-spring soil moisture from above
   average to below average caused a shift in the unsown species present.
   Drought followed by good winter soil moisture triggered extraordinary
   pulses of Cirsium vulgare. There was no apparent effect of either the
   species shift or pulses of unsown species on animal liveweight gain.
   The results are examined in terms of biodiversity and selection of
   species as indicators of overgrazing.}},

Journal = {{CONSERVATION BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{1996}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{741-749}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Two assumptions underlie the current conservation focus worldwide. The
   first is that democratic governments can restrict human resource use
   within protected areas, and the second is that human land use for
   subsistence leads to degradation and is incompatible with the
   maintenance of high levels of biological diversity. An examination of
   official policy documents over the past century indicates that Gaddi
   borders of Himachal Pradesh, northwestern Indian Himalaya, have used
   political influence to circumvent bureaucratic policies of exclusion and
   that there is an absence of scientific evidence to support the notion
   that Gaddi grazing leads to land degradation. Although grazing intensity
   has profoundly shaped the structure and composition of the Siwalik
   forests (the Gaddi winter grazing grounds), as demonstrated by
   transect-based data presented here, deviations from a supposed
   `'climax'' community need not constitute degradation. A growing rather
   than declining cattle population attests to the regenerative capacities
   of these forest. Within the alpine meadows graced by the Gaddi in
   summer, mean plant species richness increased along transects
   originating at border camps and extending 250 m north of herder camp
   site. Intense grazing pressure or heavy manuring by livestock bedded at
   night are likely to be responsible for the observed low species
   diversity adjacent to the campsite, but the effect is insignificant at
   the level of the overall landscape. interviews with herders also suggest
   the presence of a sizable, though hunted, mammalian fauna in these high
   altitude meadows. Recognition of the difficulties associated with
   implementing restrictive policies, and the fact that human land-sue
   practices need not lead to degradation or to a decline in biological
   diversity, should lead to more inclusive conservation policies within
   protected areas as well as an expansion of the conservation focus beyond
   protected-area boundaries.}},

Abstract = {{Dry alvar grasslands on limestone on the Baltic island of Oland, SE
   Sweden, are very species-rich as long as the traditional agricultural
   exploitation of grazing and fire wood collection continues. After
   abandonment, encroachment of Juniperus communis starts and a closed
   woodland can develop within 100 yr. A chronosequence, representing a
   successional series, was used for the comparison of sites still grazed,
   and sites ungrazed for about 20, 55 and 80 yr, respectively. Out of the
   58 characteristic dry alvar grassland species 55 \% disappeared from the
   established vegetation after 80 yr of abandoning, and 80 \% also
   vanished from the seed bank. Arenaria serpyllifolia, Trifolium repens,
   Agrostis vinealis, Linum catharticum, Polygala vulgaris, Cerastium
   fontanum, Luzula campestris, Achillea millefolium and Potentilla
   tabernaemontani were the only species left in the seed bank. More than
   75 \% of the dry alvar grassland species were classified as having a
   transient or short-term persistent seed bank. It is concluded that
   restoration management, by cutting junipers, of overgrown dry alvar
   grassland cannot rely on the longevity of seeds in the soil. Seeds have
   to be dispersed by wind or grazing animals.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the hypothesis that shoot (light) competition is the
   main interaction determining the community change during succession from
   a relatively species-poor deciduous forest (an overgrown former
   grassland) to a species-rich grassland, while root (nutrient)
   competition is of little importance. In a 4-yr restoration experiment,
   clearcutting, mowing and root trenching were used as treatments. The
   results did not reject the hypothesis. However, the significance of
   separating two kinds of shoot competition - `coarse-scale (between
   different growth forms) and `fine-scale' (between similar growth forms)
   became evident. Release from the `coarse-scale' shoot competition
   (between different growth forms) increased species richness at the
   beginning of the experiment. This change was interpreted as the
   replacement of one species pool (shade-tolerant herbaceous perennials)
   by another (light-demanding herbaceous perennials), the second pool
   containing considerably more species. The importance of `fine-scale'
   shoot competition increased gradually - the levelling of competition by
   mowing resulted in a more pronounced increase in species richness during
   successive years. The elimination of `coarse-scale' root competition
   seemed to be important to some extent only in combination with another
   treatment - mowing. Initial colonization of the cleared area by
   individual species was a stochastic process which had little relevance
   to life-history traits. True grassland species were able to colonize
   quickly. On the community scale, the developing community still remained
   relatively poor in species. In all plots which were cleared but not
   mown, succession already started to reverse towards woody vegetation in
   the third year.}},

Abstract = {{We mapped areas of congruence and conflict between the objectives of
   protecting red pandas (Ailurus fulgens) and meeting the claims and needs

   Semi-structured interviews were used to solicit information on land-use
   practices, and spatial information technology (sketch maps, satellite
   images, geographical information systems) was used to place these
   practices in a spatial contest and to model the effects of grazing.
   Spatial information technology was useful for delineating areas where
   conflicts occur between the objectives of preserving biodiversity and
   meeting the needs of local residents. Despite the fact that villagers
   recognize pasture boundaries, rules and regulations govern pasture
   management, and sanctions are imposed on violators, over 60\% of the red
   panda's habitat is heavily grazed, and all available land within the
   study site suitable for grazing is already being used. The study
   suggests that common property management of natural resources to protect
   biodiversity (i.e., red pandas) and meet the needs of local people at
   the same time will be difficult.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A long-term field experiment in limestone grassland near Burton (North
   Derbyshire, United Kingdom) was designed to identify plant attributes
   and vegetation characteristics conducive to successful invasion. Plots
   containing crossed, continuous gradients of fertilizer addition and
   disturbance intensity were subjected to a single-seed inoculum
   comprising a wide range of plant functional types and 54 species not
   originally present at the site. Several disturbance treatments were
   applied; these included the creation of gaps of contrasting size and the
   mowing of the vegetation to different heights and at different times of
   the year. This paper analyzes the factors controlling the initial phase
   of the resulting invasions within the plots subject to gap creation.
   The susceptibility of the indigenous community to invasion was strongly
   related to the availability of bare ground created, but greatest success
   occurred where disturbance coincided with eutrophication. Disturbance
   damage to the indigenous dominants (particularly Festuca ovina) was an
   important determinant of seedling establishment by the sown invaders.
   Large seed size was identified as an important characteristic allowing
   certain species to establish relatively evenly across the
   productivity-disturbance matrix; smaller-seeded species were more
   dependent on disturbance for establishment. Successful and unsuccessful
   invaders were also distinguished to some extent by differences in
   germination requirements and present geographical distribution.}},

   based on their habitat preference and the influence of the non-preferred
   habitat. The number of individuals trapped progressively decreased from
   the pasture across the interface to the plantation habitat. Species
   richness increased by some 72\% and diversity by some 141\% at the
   interface. These increases were attributable to both the overlap of
   pasture and plantation species invading the non-preferred habitat across
   the interface, and to the presence of species with a preference for the
   ecotone. The overlap of pasture and plantation species was found to be
   the larger part of the spider community at the interface, species
   classed as ecotone accounting for only 25\% of the catch at the
   interface. Distinct spider species assemblages were found in the pasture
   and plantation habitats, and the interface species composition similar

   affected by soil organisms, both directly (root symbionts and

Abstract = {{Decline of soil microarthropod biodiversity is described in the
   sequence: old forest stands, low-input grasslands, high-input grasslands
   (with and without the use of persistent pesticides). With this expected
   trend of declining biodiversity, the patterns of species losses are
   analysed with the use of classifications of life-history tactics,
   feeding guilds and tolerances to drought. Species intolerant to drought
   are absent in grasslands, but present in old forest stands. Also the
   fraction of thelytokously reproducing microarthropods is higher in old
   forest stands compared with low-input grasslands. The main difference
   between low-input and high-input grasslands is found in the feeding
   guild structure of the community. Low-input grasslands are dominated by
   (herbo-) fungivorous grazers, whereas high-input grasslands are
   dominated by fungivorous browsers. Application of DDT in high-input
   grasslands shows a high density of microarthropods with a high fraction
   of thelytokous reproduction, associated with a decrease in genetic
   variation in a thelytokously reproducing species. Patterns in species
   losses, the species filters, are explained and discussed. It is shown

   Ungulate herbivory profoundly affected the distribution and abundance of

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the critical phases of the life
   cycle of Gentiana pneumonanthe, the marsh gentian, a threatened species
   of the Bohemian flora. The effect of various conditions on germination
   and seedling establishment and the possible effect of competition on the
   performance of the species were tested. Seeds were sown in plots which
   were subjected to four treatments in a randomized complete blocks
   experiment: unmanaged meadow, mown meadow, burned meadow, and meadow
   with cut sod. The significantly highest recruitment was found in plots
   with cut sod, the lowest in the unmanaged control plots. Seedling
   survival also differed among the treatments. In the following year
   surviving individuals were only found in plots with cut sod. The
   influence of neighbouring vegetation on target gentian individuals was
   evaluated by removing the surrounding vegetation and comparing the
   performance of these individuals with controls. The initial height of
   each individual was measured and used as a covariable. No significant
   effect of neighbouring vegetation on performance was detected. Thus, the
   establishment phase appears to be critical for population persistence
   and is also more influenced by the management regime than other stages
   of the life cycle.}},

Volume = {{105}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{302-312}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Invasions by exotic weedy plants frequently occur in highly disturbed or
   otherwise anthropogenically altered habitats. Here we present evidence
   that, within California coastal prairie, invasion also can be
   facilitated by a native nitrogen-fixing shrub, bush lupine (Lupinus
   arboreus). Bush lupines fix nitrogen and grow rapidly, fertilizing the
   sandy soil with nitrogen-rich litter. The dense lupine canopy blocks
   light, restricting vegetative growth under bushes. Heavy insect
   herbivory kills lupines, opening exposed nitrogen-rich sites within the
   plant community. Eventual re-establishment of lupine occurs because of
   an abundant and long-lived seed bank. Lupine germination, rapid growth,
   shading and fertilization of sites, and then death after only a few
   years, results in a mosaic of nutrient-rich sites that are available to
   invading species. To determine the role of bush lupine death and
   nitrogen enrichment in community composition, we examined nutrient
   dynamics and plant community characteristics within a site only recently
   colonized by lupine, comparing patches where lupines had recently died
   or were experimentally killed with adjacent areas lacking lupine. In
   experimentally killed patches, instantaneous pool sizes of exchangeable
   ammonium and nitrate nitrogen were higher than in adjacent sites free of
   lupine. Seedlings of the introduced grass Bromus diandrus accumulated
   48\% greater root biomass and 93\% more shoot biomass when grown in a
   greenhouse in soil collected under experimentally killed lupines
   compared to B. diandrus seedlings grown in soil collected at least 1 m
   away from lupines. At the end of the spring growing season, total
   above-ground live plant biomass was more than twice as great in dead
   lupine patches as in the adjacent lupine-free grassland, but dead lupine
   patches contained 47\% fewer plant species and 57\% fewer native
   species. Sites where lupines have repeatedly died and reestablished
   during recent decades support an interstitial grassland community high
   in productivity but low in diversity, composed of mostly weedy
   introduced annual plants. In contrast, at a site only recently colonized
   by bush lupines, the interstitial grassland consists of a less
   productive but more diverse set of native and introduced species. We
   suggest that repeated bouts of lupine germination, establishment, and
   death can convert a rich native plant community into a less diverse
   collection of introduced weeds.}},

Abstract = {{Plant community structure was investigated in a species-poor grassland
   on slightly alkaline soil, subjected to eight combinations of seasonal
   grazing management.
   The `'Linear patch model'' of BYCROFT et al. (1993) and the `'Site
   model'' of WILSON et al. (1987) were used to examine variance in local
   species richness, since a variance deficit (in comparison with a null
   model) is a possible indication of niche limitation. Even though
   treatment had affected species composition, the degree of variance
   deficit was essentially constant between grazing treatments. Grass
   species richness was also unaffected by grazing regime. Species
   association was examined by a new method, that discounts the tendency to
   negative association that will be caused by any constraint on local
   species richness. There were differences in association between
   paddocks, related to both treatments and blocks, but these were
   individualistic to the sample, apparently because of species spatial
   patchiness. Differences between replicate paddocks were generally as
   great as those between treatments. However, the effect of Spring grazing
   on the association between Hordeum secalinum and Agrostis stolonifera
   was opposite between the two Winter grazing levels.
   Pattern of the more common species was investigated, again via a new
   test, one based on runs. The pattern of Agrostis stolonifera was
   constant irrespective of grazing treatment, even though its abundance
   had changed. However, Lolium perenne was affected by grazing - under
   winter grazing its occurrences were less clumped - even though grazing
   had no effect on its mean abundance.
   There was therefore some indication of small effects of winter grazing
   on community structure, i.e. regularities in the patterns of species
   co-occurrences that might be caused by limitations to species
   coexistence. Apart from this, community structure was quickly restored
   after the imposition of different grazing regimes, to that typical of
   stable communities. Applying the Gitay-Wilson. `'Three-phase model'' of
   succession, the `'Pioneer'' phase in this grassland lasted less than
   five years. It is concluded that the grassland is currently in the
   second, `'Building'', phase.}},

   grassland habitats, either grazed or mown. were studied to analyze
   differences between species compositions The data were classified with
   TWINSPAN and ordinated with Detrended Correspondence Analysis and
   Canonical Correspondence Analysis. The multivariate analysis recognized
   successfully habitats that are either presently used or differ
   considerably from the others by their moisture gradient although a few
   very common generalist species were present in almost every seral stage
   studied. The studied deviant habitats resemble most of the previously
   described vegetation types in northern Finland. Results suggest that
   drought can delay the invasion of tall broad-leaved species. The results
   also support the idea that abandoned meadows of corresponding moisture
   gradients begin to resemble each other in later stages of succession.
   Multivariate methods can be used to determine the succession stages in
   grassland habitats and thus help to determine the urgency for
   restoration practices.}},

Volume = {{105}},

Abstract = {{The ability of plants to rapidly replace photosynthetic tissues
   following defoliation represents a resistance strategy referred to as
   herbivory tolerance. Rapid reprioritization of carbon allocation to
   regrowing shoots at the expense of roots following defoliation is a
   widely documented tolerance mechanism. An experiment was conducted in a
   controlled environment to test the hypothesis that herbivory-sensitive
   perennial grasses display less flexibility in reprioritizing carbon
   allocation in response to defoliation than do grasses possessing greater
   herbivory tolerance. An equivalent proportion of shoot biomass (60\% dry
   weight) was removed from two C-4 perennial grasses recognized as
   herbivory-sensitive, Andropogon gerardii and Schizachyrium scoparium,
   and two C-4 perennial grasses recognized as herbivory-tolerant, Aristida
   purpurea and Bouteloua rigidiseta. Both defoliated and undefoliated
   plants were exposed to (CO2)-C-13 for 30 min, five plants per species
   were harvested at 6, 72 and 168 h following labeling, and biomass was
   analyzed by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. The tallgrass, A. gerardii,
   exhibited inflexible allocation priorities while the shortgrass, B.
   rigidiseta, exhibited flexible allocation priorities in response to
   defoliation which corresponded with their initial designations as
   herbivory-sensitive and herbivory-tolerant species, respectively. A.
   gerardii had the greatest percentage and concentration of C-13 within
   roots and lowest percentage of C-13 within regrowth of the four species
   evaluated. In contrast, B. rigidiseta had a greater percentage of C-13
   within regrowth than did A. gerardii, the greatest percentage of C-13
   within new leaves of defoliated plants, and the lowest concentration of
   C-13 within roots following defoliation. Although both midgrasses, S.
   scoparium and A. purpurea, demonstrated flexible allocation priorities
   in response to defoliation, they were counter to those stated in the
   initial hypothesis. The concentration of C-13 within new leaves of S.
   scoparium increased in-response to a single defoliation while the
   percentage and concentration of C-13 With in roots was reduced. A.
   purpurea was the only species in which the percentage of C-13 within new
   leaves decreased while the percentage of C-13 within roots increased
   following defoliation. The most plausible alternative hypothesis to
   explain the inconsistency between the demonstrated responsiveness of
   allocation priorities to defoliation and the recognized herbivory
   resistance of S. scoparium and A. purpurea is that the relative ability
   of these species to avoid herbivory may make an equal or greater
   contribution to their overall herbivory resistance than does herbivory
   tolerance. Selective herbivory may contribute to S. scoparium's
   designation as a herbivory-sensitive species even though it possesses
   flexible allocation priorities in response to defoliation.
   Alternatively, the recognized herbivory resistance of A. purpurea may be
   a consequence of infrequent and/or lenient herbivory associated with the
   expression of avoidance mechanisms, rather than the expression of
   tolerance mechanisms. A greater understanding of the relative
   contribution of tolerance and avoidance strategies of herbivory
   resistance are required to accurately interpret how herbivory influences
   plant function, competitive interactions, and species abundance in
   grazed communities.}},

Abstract = {{With the intensification of agricultural practices, formerly species
   rich marginal grassland communities of high botanical value in the
   Netherlands have been fertilized or manured since the first part of the
   twentieth century. This type of land use resulted in a dramatic decrease
   of the original plant species-richness. In the early 1970's yearly
   nutrient input to many of these grasslands was ceased as a nature
   management practice, while hay-cropping was continued. This type of
   grassland management is carried out to decrease overall nutrient
   supplying ability of the soil to plant cover in order to restore their
   original high botanical richness. The effect of this management on the
   type and the extent of nutrient deficiency was studied by comparing the
   short-term shoot responsiveness of undisturbed turfs to added nutrients
   and the nutrient status of fieldgrown dominants of four hay-field
   communities which were not fertilized for 3, 7, 20 or 25 years.
   Contrary to expectation, hay-cropping without input of additional
   nutrients did not impose an increase of species-richness of grassland on
   gley podzol. During early vegetation change strong inadequacy of N
   supply and moderate inadequacy of K supply by the soil regulate (shoot)
   growth. P-deficiency was not established. Prolonged discontinuation of
   fertilizer application caused concomitant inadequate supplies of N, K
   and P. In the last field (25 years unfertilized), nutrient deficiencies
   could not be detected by shoot growth responses to added nutrients but
   only by a low nutrient status. It appeared that during this type of
   vegetation change N-deficiency is the most pronounced and that
   K-deficiency developes much more rapidly than P-deficiency. The strong
   decline in total aerial pool sizes of N, K and P also emphasizes these
   simultaneously occurring shifts.
   We conclude that cut grassland composition on gley podzol soil is
   regulated by co-deficiencies of at least the soil phytoavailable
   macronutrients nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus. The absence of change
   in plant species number is likely not regulated by the nutrient
   supplying ability of the soil. Seed dispersal from elsewhere seems to be
   the most important factor.}},

Abstract = {{Historical increases in the density of unpalatable shrubs and trees have
   reduced the carrying capacity and threaten the sustainability of
   livestock production in arid and semi-arid grasslands and savannas
   around the world. Biodiversity, wildlife habitat and nutrient cycling
   (rates, magnitude, seasonality and spatial patterns) are also affected
   by these changes in vegetation. While historical increases in woody
   plane abundance have been widely noted, the rates, dynamics, spatial
   patterns and proximate causes have not been well documented. Here, I
   briefly review potential explanations for increased abundance of woody
   plants in dryland ecosystems and discuss how activities of domestic and
   native herbivores might influence the balance between grasses and woody
   plants. Conceptual models of woody plant seedling establishment in
   grazed ecosystems are presented and evaluated with case studies of an
   invasive North American arborescent, honey mesquite (Prosopis
   glandulosa). Reduction in grass interference, achieved experimentally or
   by grazing, may have a positive effect on woody plants but is not a
   prerequisite for successful seedling establishment in many systems. It
   is argued that thresholds of herbaceous utilisation required for woody
   plants to establish successfully may be readily exceeded, even at light
   levels of grazing. Thus, grazing management schemes muse aggressively
   incorporate the use of fire as well as emphasise the degree of grass
   utilisation and maintenance of species composition, if dominance of
   woody plants is to be regulated successfully.}},

Abstract = {{The separate and combined effects of fire and cattle grazing on
   structure and diversity of productive Mediterranean grasslands in
   northern Israel were examined within a set of climatically and
   edaphically similar sites. Cover and height of green and dry plants in
   winter, and species richness and diversity in spring, were measured in
   paired transects on both sides of cattle fences, and on both sides of
   boundaries of both incidental and experimentally lit fires.
   Early in the first growing season after a fire, plant cover as well as
   height of green plants were reduced, compared to unburnt grassland.
   These structural effects of fire were similar to the effects of grazing,
   but they were greater in ungrazed than in grazed grasslands, indicating
   a fire-grazing interaction. The effects of fire were considerably
   attenuated in the second growing season after the fire.
   Species richness and diversity tended to be higher in grazed than in
   adjacent ungrazed grasslands. Richness consistently increased after a
   fire only in grazed grasslands with a strong perennial component. In
   ungrazed grasslands, and in predominantly annual grasslands, fires
   reduced species richness and diversity at least as often as they
   increased it.
   Fire and grazing should be regarded as two agents with distinct and

   mechanisms of a general disturbance factor.}},

Abstract = {{The community structure of a species-rich grassland was investigated at
   a small spatial scale (0.001 m(2)), to determine whether evidence
   suggesting assembly rules could be found in temporal or spatial
   variation in either species richness or guild proportions. The community
   was alvar limestone grassland on the island of Oland, Sweden. Three
   sites were sampled: two lightly grazed, the other recently ungrazed.
   Plots with and without fertilizer were compared.
   Evidence was sought for restriction on the ability of species to
   co-occur within a limited spatial area. Restriction due to a limited
   number of niches available, `niche limitation', could be manifest as
   lower variance in quadrat richness than expected under a null model
   (i.e. RV(r), the ratio of observed: expected variance in richness, would
   be < 1.0). In several cases, RV(r) values were significantly < 1.0, even
   using a patch model to allow for possible spatial variation in the
   environment. Low RV(r) values were found only at the smallest square
   quadrat size, 10 cm(2). On Fertilized plots in the years immediately
   after application of fertilizer, low RV(r) could not be demonstrated.
   Explanations of low RV(r) other than niche limitation are considered,
   such as environmental heterogeneity (present and/or historical) and of
   individual plant modules.
   Assembly rules based on guild membership were sought by looking at the
   variance across quadrats in the proportions of species from
   morphological guilds. An assembly rule would be seen as relatively
   constant proportion, estimated via RV(gp), the ratio of
   observed:expected Variances in guild proportions. Significant guild
   proportionality was found in some cases. There was no evidence of guild
   proportionality in the years after the application of fertilizer.
   The significant effects in RV(r) were more numerous than expected on a
   random basis, though not observed in every site in every year. Similar
   trends were seen in RV(gp). At the space/time scales examined, the
   species in a plant community may be constrained by assembly rules only
   intermittently, e.g. when resources are more limiting (Wiens 1977).
   Under this concept, when competition is relaxed, such as following
   fertilizer application, there is a temporary microhabitat `waterhole' in
   which more species can coexist, and the assembly rules break down, at
   least temporarily whilst the species composition adjusts. There was some
   indication of a return to more deterministic community structure four
   years after fertilization commenced.
   Variants of van der Maarel's Carousel model were tested. A Niche-limited
   Carousel Model (i.e. a model in which there is some limitation in the
   number of species that can occupy a microsite) would imply restricted
   variation in richness through time for a single quadrat (temporal
   RV(r)). Overall differences between years in species richness were
   demonstrated, and their effect removed; after this adjustment there was
   support for the Niche-limited Carousel Model. The extent of this
   limitation varied between sites. There were also consistent differences
   between quadrats in species richness. There was little evidence for
   constancy of guild proportions through time.
   The site that showed the strongest community structure in time and
   space, least year-to-year variation in mean species richness, and least
   response to fertilizer perturbation, is that on the shallowest soil.
   Possibly the thin soil results in greater resource limitation,
   supporting suggestions that assembly rules are stronger when resources
   are more limited.}},

   planted to a legume-dominated seed mixture. I also resampled a subset of
   these fields two years later. Over time, these hayfields changed from
   tall, dense, homogeneous stands of legume-dominated vegetation to short,
   sparse, patchy stands of grass-dominated vegetation. Fields of all ages
   were dominated by introduced plant species. Red-winged Blackbirds
   (Agelaius phoeniceus), the most common bird species breeding in these
   fields, were most common in fields of intermediate ages, whereas numbers
   of Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), the second most abundant species,
   increased logarithmically with field age. Upland Sandpipers (Bartramia
   longicauda), Eastern Meadowlarks (Sturnella magna), Grasshopper Sparrows
   (Ammodramus savannarum), and Henslow's Sparrows (A. henslowii) were most
   abundant in the oldest hayfields, whereas abundances of Savannah
   Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis, the third most common species) did
   not differ in fields of different ages. Bird-species richness and
   diversity increased linearly with hayfield age. Three species
   (Red-winged Blackbird, Bobolink, Savannah Sparrow) accounted for more
   than 90\% of the breeding individuals. Vegetation structure,
   composition, and patch size were the most important proximate correlates
   of habitat selection for these species. Hayfield size was positively
   correlated with abundance for five of the seven most common species.
   Furthermore, those species that nested late in the season (Bobolinks,
   Grasshopper Sparrows, and Henslow's Sparrows) had low breeding densities

Abstract = {{Physiological and developmental processes of plants are affected by UV-B
   radiation, even by the amount of UV-B in present-day sunlight. Plants
   also have several mechanisms to ameliorate or repair these effects and
   may acclimate to a certain extent to increased levels of UV-B.
   Nevertheless, plant growth can be directly affected by UV-B radiation.
   Response to UV-B also varies considerably among species and also
   cultivars of the same species. In agriculture, this may necessitate
   using more UV-B-tolerant cultivars and breeding new ones. In forests and
   grasslands, this will likely result in changes in species composition;
   therefore there are implications for the biodiversity in different
   ecosystems. Indirect changes caused by UV-B-such as changes in plant
   form, biomass allocation to parts of the plant, timing of developmental
   phases and secondary metabolism-may be equally, or sometimes more
   important than damaging effects of UV-B. These changes can have
   important implications for plant competitive balance, herbivory, plant
   pathogens, and biogeochemical cycles. These ecosystem-level effects can
   be anticipated, but not easily predicted or evaluated. Research at the
   ecosystem level for solar UV-B is barely beginning. Other factors,
   including those involved in climate change such as increasing CO2, also
   interact with UV-B. Such reactions are not easily predicted, but are of
   obvious importance in both agriculture and in nonagricultural
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The New Forest of southeastern England is an outstanding landscape in
   both natural and cultural terms. Its scenic and other special qualities
   have evolved as a result of the interaction of soils, vegetation,
   animals, land use, and human activities over many centuries. The
   qualities of the New Forest are currently threatened with changes
   arising primarily from recreational and tourism pressures from the city
   of London and other nearby areas. The conservation and land-use policies
   and practices for the New Forest are undergoing review; various
   proposals for management changes may decrease the influence of
   institutions such as the Verderers, a Crown body that for centuries has
   played an important role in guiding land uses such as grazing by ponies
   and other livestock. This grazing has strongly influenced the unique
   character of the heath, grassland, and deciduous woodlands of the New
   Forest and contributed to a high level of biodiversity and other values
   in the area. The New Forest planning proposals therefore deserve very
   careful scrutiny before implementation. The European and global
   significance of the New Forest also merit greater recognition through
   designation, preferably as a `'world heritage site,'' which would
   encourage standards of management appropriate to its international
   stature.}},

Abstract = {{Species richness and small-scale spatial dynamics (turnover) were
   compared in four sites during 1990-1993: 1) former alvar grassland, now
   young Pinus sylvestris forest, 2) clear-cut in 1990, 3) clear-cut and
   grazed by sheep, 4) nearby grassland. It was hypothesized that in
   communities which show large-scale dynamics, small-scale dynamics is
   also more rapid to support succession. Area-based species richness and
   shoot density increased in the cut and grazed site. No significant
   dynamics was found in shoot-based species richness. Therefore the forest
   was considered to be stable and the cut and grazed site large-scale
   dynamical (successional). Almost equally high small-scale turnover
   values were found in all sites, which supports the carousel model for
   successional communities, but means we had to reject the initial
   hypothesis. The successional and intrinsic small-scale dynamics of the
   communities studied were two separate processes which acted at different
   scales, but the scale could not be only spatially determined, it
   depended also on the shoot density. The overgrowing of this former alvar
   grassland has resulted in the decrease of shoot density and thus the
   decrease of species richness per unit area, but the total number of
   species has not changed much. Consequently the possibility to restore
   grassland communities remains.}},

Abstract = {{A survey of present genetic resources and associated research and
   funding was conducted in May 1992 at the request of the Ministry of
   Research, Science and Technology (MRST) and the Commonwealth Science
   Council (CSC). Abundant information was supplied by scientific
   institutions, government departments, botanic gardens, horticultural
   societies and private individuals but much of it is disconnected and
   difficult to compare. There are large genetic resources in New Zealand,
   but a shortage of information and communication about them. There are an
   estimated 50,000 species of native animals, plants, fungi and protists
   in New Zealand, of which fewer than 17,000 have been described,
   including only small proportions of some groups, e.g. fungi (20\%) or
   insects (55\%) but more in others, e.g. plants (more than 80\%).
   However, we understand the numbers, population dynamics, conservation
   status and management requirements of only a handful of species. Fewer
   than 25\% of the plant species are cultivated and none is economically
   significant (except for the extractive `'mining'' of timber resources
   and extensive grazing of tussock grassland). But there is potential for
   economic development of many species. The Government allocates a greater
   amount of research and conservation funding per species to native than
   to exotic species, but exotics get more private funding (this does not
   imply that either is `'enough'' funding).
   Presently, New Zealand primary production is almost wholly dependent on
   exotic germplasm. Several thousand species have been introduced into the
   country, but only 19 plant species cover more than 95\% of all
   cultivated land. Estimates of total numbers of species are uncertain.
   There may be some 2,450 native vascular plant species and over 6,000
   living exotic species. The collation of information on germplasm and its
   preservation is presently limited by a lack of financial support. Total
   investment in biodiversity research is less than 0.04\% of GDP, with
   another 0.1\% spent on conservation. Several attempts to create a
   network of people involved in studying genetic resources have been made
   in the past. The ratification of the International Convention on
   Biological Diversity makes this an appropriate time to review what
   information and resources we have and to connect the dispersed elements
   into a coherent system. Some key issues are discussed, including
   national policy on biodiversity and indigenous rights.
   I recommend a feasibility study to determine whether a generalised
   genetic resource network is appropriate for New Zealand, and, if so,
   what form and scope it should have. Such a network would involve an
   increase in communication between people involved with germplasm,
   educating and empowering people to research and conserve, establishing
   protocols for the exchange of germplasm and transfer formats for data,
   sharing in conservation, establishing priorities and representing New
   Zealand's position overseas. I recommend that greater efforts, training
   and funding be spent on biodiversity research and conservation, with
   emphasis on lesser- known species. Rather than an `'altruistic'' cost,
   this spending is seen as an investment with potentially high returns for
   society, both in economic terms and from a social, aesthetic and ethical
   perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the Laikipia ecosystem in Kenya, isolated glades occur within
   acacia bushland and woodland communities. These glades are at least
   several decades old. They are reported to be old settlement sites of
   traditional pastoralists no longer present, and their size, location,
   and orientation are consistent with the settlement sites of related
   pastoralists studied elsewhere. The purpose of this study was to
   document the effects of these glades at the local and landscape levels.
   Working in central Laikipia, we documented differences in vegetation,
   animal use, and soils at four of these glades, and at increasing
   distances from glade edges. Four `'glade specialists'' dominated the
   plant communities within glades, and were very rare outside of glades.
   Pennisetum stramineum, one of six glade edge species, formed a ring of
   dense tall grass around most glade edges. The transition to acacia
   bushland at the glade edges was not always abrupt (depending on the
   trait considered), resulting in edge effects that differed in depth and
   sharpness. Edge depth, defined as the distance required to attain
   two-thirds of background levels for a trait, ranged from 0 to 200 m.
   Understory plant species richness and diversity were lowest inside
   glades, and gradually increased with distance from glades. However,
   because glades supported species not found elsewhere, the presence of
   glades increased overall species diversity. The density of wild and
   domestic large mammal dung was up to 10 times greater inside the glades,
   and declined with distance from glade edges. Similarly, soil nitrogen,
   potassium, carbon, calcium, and sodium were greatest inside glades. Soil
   phosphorus, magnesium, and manganese were not elevated inside glades or
   within 100 m of glades, but instead were much more abundant in
   background samples. These glades may be maintained by high densities of
   large mammals, either through herbivory or through changes in soil
   chemistry. Glades may be attractive to mammals because of the high
   quality of food there, or as part of an anti-predator strategy. The
   result is a relatively permanent community mosaic that increases
   ecosystem heterogeneity and resource use by domestic and wild animals.
   The spatial nature of this heterogeneity differs among species,
   depending on their distributions relative to the glades.}},

Abstract = {{Snails were collected from seven chalk grassland sites, in order to
   assess variation in snail faunas with respect to location, vegetation,
   and management practices. Four of the sites were grazed, intermittently
   to continuously, and three had been irregularly burned and mown. Snails
   that are characteristic of the dry, open conditions of chalk grasslands
   made up 28\% to 94\% of all individuals, and 33\% to 75\% of all species
   at the different sites. Open-country snails tended to be relatively more
   common at sites that had been consistently grazed than at sites that
   were mown or burned, although some heavily grazed sites showed low
   overall snail abundance. Sites varied with respect to turf height, the
   size of gaps in the turf, soil moisture, and higher plant species
   richness, but none of these site characteristics were good predictors of
   the proportion of open-country snails. Comparisons of fresh and old
   shells at any given site can indicate whether particular species have
   changed in relative abundance over time. No changes were evident at two
   sites, Wylye Down and Galley Hill, but three of nine species changed at
   Aston Rowant South, and four of ten species at Castle Hill. As a group,
   open-country snails declined relative to other snails at just one site,
   Castle Hill, which had been consistently grazed. This study confirms
   site-to-site variability in chalk grassland snail faunas, while finding
   faunal composition to be generally constant through time within each
   site. Thus, mechanical cutting and burning, as well as grazing, may be
   able to maintain habitat for some open-country British snail species.}},

   and dense tree layer had developed. There were fewer plant species
   growing in ungrazed plots than in grazed plots, but the difference was
   not significant. However, the number of species per square metre was
   significantly lower in ungrazed plots. Hence, on a smaller scale, the
   ground vegetation had become less diverse, but on a larger scale few
   species had been lost. In the seed bank, a few species lost from the
   vegetation were still present as seeds in the soil, but in most cases
   species lost were not recorded in the seed bank. Seeds of species that
   had colonized plots over the 18 yr were evenly distributed in the soil

Abstract = {{Diversity of the calcicolous lichen flora and grazing damage to lichens
   were recorded on 12 limestone walls in the grassland Great Alvar on the
   Baltic island of Oland, southeastern Sweden. Grazing damage of lichens
   was compared with the abundance of potential lichen herbivores (land
   snails and oribatid mites). A total of 52 Lichen species, 2 lichen
   parasites, one alga, 2 bryophytes, one vascular plant (Sedum acre) and
   cyanobacteria, most of them belonging to the family Chroococcaceae, were
   found on the upper layer of the stone walls. The number of lichen
   species encountered on single stone walls ranged from 21 to 33.
   Between-wall differences in species richness were not due to differences
   in sampling effort. Similarity coefficients of species composition
   showed a high similarity of the lichen communities between stone walls.
   Aspicilia calcarea was the dominant lichen which covered on average
   66.1\% of the upper surface of the stone walls (range among stone walls:
   11.9-89.8\%). Grazing damage was recorded in 33 (63.5\%) of the 52
   lichen species. In general, lichen species that occurred frequently were
   more severely damaged than rare lichen species, although 5 frequent
   species showed no grazing damage at all. Six species of land snails and
   oribatid mites were encountered on the stone walls. Two of the snail
   species (Chondrina clienta and Balea perversa, both known as lichen
   feeders) were abundant on some stone walls. The proportion of lichen
   species that showed,orating damage was not influenced by the
   presence/absence (and density) of either snail species or mites except
   that the level of grazing damage in the dominant lichen species A.

Journal = {{AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{1995}},
Volume = {{43}},

Pages = {{349-366}},
Abstract = {{Before European settlement, grassy white box woodlands were the dominant
   vegetation in the east of the wheat-sheep belt of south-eastern
   Australia. Tree clearing, cultivation and pasture improvement have led
   to fragmentation of this once relatively continuous ecosystem, leaving a
   series of remnants which themselves have been modified by livestock
   grazing. Little-modified remnants are extremely rare. We examined and
   compared the effects of fragmentation and disturbance on the understorey
   flora of woodland remnants, through a survey of remnants of varying
   size, grazing history and tree clearing. In accordance with
   fragmentation theory, species richness generally increased with remnant
   size, and, for little-grazed remnants, smaller remnants were more
   vulnerable to weed invasion. Similarly, tree clearing and grazing
   encouraged weed invasion and reduced native species richness. Evidence
   for increased total species richness at intermediate grazing levels, as
   predicted by the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, was equivocal.
   Remnant quality was more severely affected by grazing than by remnant
   size. All little-grazed remnants had lower exotic species abundance and
   similar or higher native species richness than grazed remnants, despite
   their extremely small sizes (< 6 ha). Further, small, little grazed
   remnants maintained the general character of the pre-European woodland
   understorey, while grazing caused changes to the dominant species
   Although generally small, the little-grazed remnants are the best
   representatives of the pre-European woodland understorey, and should be
   central to any conservation plan for the woodlands. Selected larger
   remnants are needed to complement these, however, to increase the total
   area of woodland conserved, and, because most little-grazed remnants are
   cleared, to represent the ecosystem in its original structural form. For
   the maintenance of native plant diversity and composition in
   little-grazed remnants, it is critical that livestock grazing continues
   to be excluded. For grazed remnants, maintenance of a site in its
   current state would allow continuation of past management, while
   restoration to a pre-European condition would require management
   directed towards weed removal, and could take advantage of the
   difference noted in the predominant life-cycle of native (perennial)
   versus exotic (annual or biennial) species.}},

   Distinct variation patterns were recognized among the 48 species and

   variation pattern including abundant graminoids reflects a strong direct
   effect by weather conditions in the first growth period. Species of the

Abstract = {{An account is given of the vegetation of Flat Top Hill, in the driest
   part of semi-arid lowland Central Otago, New Zealand. Although highly
   modified, the area was acquired for conservation in 1992, following
   almost 150 years of pastoral use. The vegetation was sampled in a
   composite scheme using permanent monitoring sites placed to include the
   majority of habitats and communities present. A number of environmental
   factors were measured in each sample.
   Native species comprise 53\% of the vascular flora of the area (211
   species). From multivariate analyses of the data collected over three
   seasons, fourteen `communities' are recognised. Although there are few
   constant or faithful species, strong relationships are shown with
   certain environmental parameters. Moisture stress is the major
   environmental influence on the vegetation; soil depth and past
   disturbance are secondary determinants. The communities differ by a
   factor of 10 in vascular species richness; the richest communities, and
   those with the greatest native component, are those around rock tors.
   Many of the communities present have not been reported from other
   vegetation surveys in Central Otago Moisture stress at xeric sites in
   the dry core of the region has excluded some exotic species, and allowed
   the survival of the native component, including three tiny spring
   ephemerals.
   Near elimination of grazing, as a result of reservation, will probably
   lead to an increase in the cover of taller, palatable exotic grasses and
   Thymus vulgaris, which may threaten the survival of some native species.
   Optimum management, for recovery or persistence of native species, may
   comprise exclusion of grazers in some areas, but continuity of grazing
   in others.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation and restoration ecology efforts may conserve or restore a
   particular image of a community, a variety of plausible images, or
   maximum biological diversity.  The choice is a policy decision that
   should reflect relevant history and sound science.  Here I argue that
   common methods of conserving and restoring tallgrass prairie have a weak
   scientific rationale, are not consistent with plausible history, and
   threaten prairie biodiversity.  Dormant-season burns and grazer
   exclusion are human interventions that may promote artificially
   consistent dominance of large grasses utilizing the C4 photosynthetic
   pathway, thereby relegating hundreds of other prairie plants to small
   populations that are vulnerable to local extinction.  I recommend an
   experimental approach to large remnant conservation and restoration in
   which varied conditions alter dominance, thereby increasing short-term
   species richness.  I also recommend prescribed burning during the
   summer, to simulate the timing of lightning fire, and light-to-moderate
   grazing by different ungulates, to simulate historical grazing history. 
   Both should favor plants that are consistently infrequent or rare in
   many managed prairies.  Varied regimes of burn season, burn interval,
   and large-mammal grazing should promote greater overall species
   diversity and should more realistically represent varied conditions
   under which grassland taxa evolved.}},

   low intensity, high frequency and long history of disturbance.  We
   analysed species composition, richness, and architectural traits in
   seven neighbouring sites under different land use.  There were sharp
   floristic discontinuities between post-agricultural stages, whereas only
   minor shifts occurred among different grazing situations.  Unlike
   cultivation, grazing did not produce significant differences in species
   richness and allowed very slight invasion by exotics.  In
   post-cultivation situations, architectural differences were accounted
   for by species composition.  In the case of different grazing
   intensities, they were mainly explained by morphological differences
   among populations of the same dominants.  In view of the historical
   information and current ideas, we suggest that the differential
   responses to both land uses can be explained not only by the different
   frequencies and intensities of disturbance they represent, but also by
   their contrasting histories in the area.  Accordingly, herbivory by
   ungulates should not be considered as a disturbance in these montane

Abstract = {{Giant kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ingens) continually modify their burrow
   precincts by digging tunnels, clipping plants, and other activities. In
   the valley grasslands of the Carrizo Plain Natural Area (San Luis Obispo
   County, California), this chronic disturbance to soil and vegetation
   promoted the establishment of exotic ruderal and early successional
   plant species. Erodium cicutarium, Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens, and
   other Mediterranean annuals were found to constitute a very large
   proportion of the vegetation on giant kangaroo rat precincts. When
   vegetation on precincts was compared with the vegetation in less
   disturbed intermediate areas located between precincts, species
   richness, cover and frequency of exotic plants were significantly
   greater on precincts. The reverse was found for native species. In
   addition, exotic species encountered in this study had significantly
   larger seeds than did native species, suggesting that these granivorous
   kangaroo rats preferentially cache large weed seeds on their precincts.
   Since the kangaroo rats depend on exotic plants for food and the exotic
   plants depend upon the kangaroo rats to disturb their habitat
   continually, the weed-kangaroo rat relationship is mutualistic. This
   strong relationship may also inhibit population growth of native
   grassland plants which occupy disturbed habitats but have difficulty
   competing with exotic weeds for resources. From a conservation
   perspective, this mutualism presents an intractable management dilemma.
   Restoration of valley grasslands where endangered giant kangaroo rats
   occur, to conditions where native species dominate, may be impossible.}},

Abstract = {{1. Current agricultural overproduction in Western Europe has led to an
   increase of abandoned (unfertilized) grasslands. This paper reports on
   an experiment where, under hay-making conditions, such a man-made
   grassland has been N-fertilized (50 kg ha-1 year-1) in order to increase
   the extraction of nutrients other than N.
   2. Above-ground standing crop and soil chemical characteristics of the
   N-fertilized field were studied in comparison with an unfertilized
   control for 17 years. After 10-11 years, the twofold higher above-ground
   production in the fertilized treatment started to decrease, finally
   converging with the control. The number of species, however, was still
   lower in the N-fertilized field compared with the control. After 16
   years, no significant differences in soil chemical variables could be
   established.
   3. After 16 years, relative deficiencies of plant available N, P and K
   were estimated for both fields using several phytometric greenhouse
   methods. N and K, not P were the most limiting nutrients. A field
   experiment with factorial fertilizer application showed that the
   vegetation of the N-fertilized field did not respond to N and P, but
   responded strongly to K, contrasting with the responses of the
   vegetation of the control field, which responded to N.
   4. The results are discussed with regard to methods of measuring
   nutrient availability in soils of low fertility, to nature conservation
   practices and to species richness.}},

Abstract = {{Patterns in species richness of leaf-cutting ants inhibiting Argentina
   were analysed to identify the environmental factors that best determine
   the geographical trends.  The size of geographical ranges was also
   studied and probable barriers limiting the expansion of the geographical
   ranges were identified.  A grid composed of 311 cells of 10,000 km2 each
   was overlaid on a map of continental Argentina.  Each quadrat was
   assigned values for topographic, climatic and vegetational variables,
   with species richness determined by counting the number of species
   present in each cell.  It was observed that species richness decreased
   as latitude and longitude increased.  The Patagonia, from 44-degrees-S
   southward, and the Andean mountains, above 2500 m, lack leaf-cutters. 
   Multiple regression analysis showed that mean annual precipitation,
   intra-annual temperature variation and the minimum mean winter
   temperature are the principal determinants of leaf-cutting ant richness.
   Species harvesting different types of vegetation showed differences in
   the size of their geographical ranges.  Grass-dicot cutters are the most
   widespread species and no apparent barriers limit their southward
   expansion up to approximately 44-degrees-S.  Grass-cutters are
   restricted to the north of the Pampean grasslands and dicot cutters are
   profoundly affected by the change from woody to grass vegetation.  Both
   the size of the geographical ranges and patterns of speies richness
   strongly depend on both climatic/vegetational features of the
   environment and the biological attributes of the different foraging
   group.}},

Abstract = {{Species richness o native, rare native, and exotic understorey plants
   was recorded at 120 sites in temperate grassy vegetation in New South
   Wales. Linear models were used to predict the effects of environment and
   disturbance on the richness of each of these groups. Total native
   species and rare native species showed similar responses, with richness
   declining on sites of increasing natural fertility of parent material as
   well as declining under conditions of water enrichment (resulting from
   human-induced changes in drainage characteristics, leading to increased
   run-off), severe livestock grazing, and soil disturbance. The response
   of rare native species to water enrichment however, was significantly
   greater than that of all native species. Exotic species richness varied
   in reverse to that of native species with positive responses to water
   enrichment and soil disturbance, The contrasting behaviors are
   attributed to differences in the evolutionary history of native and
   exotic assemblages and their resulting preadaptations to a landscape
   recently subjected to agricultural settlement It would appear that for
   exogenous disturbances, the intermediate disturbance hypothesis is not
   supported by our data In the sampled region, pastures represent the
   major land-use in terms of area, but have relatively low densities of
   native and rare species compared with more lightly grazed areas.
   However, their management is considered to be essential to the
   maintenance of diversity on a regional scale.}},

Abstract = {{A distinctive feature of Australian vegetational history is the
   abruptness of change since European settlement, involving the influx of
   exotic species and the imposition of exogenous disturbances which are
   novel in both intensity and character. This can produce two sources of
   habitat variability: the natural patterns arising from environmental
   variation, as well as an overlying effect of disturbance. The relative
   importance of these two types of variables were compared in temperate
   herbaceous vegetation. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed that
   environment and disturbance had similar contributions to floristic
   variability. Individually, lithology, altitude and soil disturbance were
   the strongest variables while slope position, grazing and water
   enrichment were slightly less important.
   Despite generally low levels of site specificity, groups of species
   associated with lithology, slope position, altitude and different
   disturbance regimes were identified. Exotic species were associated with
   higher levels of disturbance, but showed levels of environmental
   specialization similar to the native component.
   Through combination of this analysis with a previous analysis of species
   richness for the same data set, it became evident that environmental
   variation mostly resulted in species substitutions while disturbances
   led to losses of species, with partial replacement by exotics.
   Synthesizing these results, we identified three broad groups in relation
   to tolerance of levels of exogenous disturbance: (1) intolerant
   species-native taxa intolerant of severe disturbances and constituting
   the species-rich component of the vegetation; (2) tolerant species -
   exotic and native taxa occurring at both disturbed and undisturbed
   habitats and (3) disturbance specialists - predominantly exotic species,
   correlated with high levels of disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{Trap-nesting bees and wasps (Hymenoptera Aculeata) colonizing crop and
   fallow fields in an agricultural landscape were studied using 20 sown
   fields (pea, barley, rye, clover-grass mixtures, Phacelia tanacetifolia)
   and 20 fields with naturally developed vegetation (1- and 2-year old
   fields, both mown and unmown, and old meadows). Fourteen species of
   Apoidea, 4 of Sphecidae, 1 of Eumenidae and 4 of parasitoids were reared
   from reed nests exposed in these 40 fields of 10 field-types. Fields
   with naturally developed vegetation had twice as many species as sown
   fields, due to the distribution pattern of the 14 bee species, whereas
   the 9 predatory species (wasps and parasitoids) showed a rather uniform
   distribution. None of the trap-nesting bees were found in Phacelia
   fields, despite contrasting expectations of bee-keepers. Old meadows
   showed a particularly high abundance and species richness, since only
   10\% of all traps were exposed, but 32\% of all bee nests were sampled
   in old meadows, including 4 bee species that were not found elsewhere.
   Accordingly, species richness of fields with naturally developed
   vegetation showed a significant increase with age. Variability in
   Hymenoptera species numbers could be explained by corresponding
   differences in plant species numbers. The alternative hypothesis that
   field size or field connectivity influenced species richness was not
   supported. Habitats with great floral diversity appeared to offer better
   and richer food resources for the flower-visiting bees, whereas food
   availability apparently did not influence predatory wasps. The bees
   Osmia caerulescens and Megachile versicolor that had colonized
   early-successional fields took twice as long to provision cells as those
   that colonized late-successional meadows characterized by a greater
   plant species richness. In contrast, the eumenid wasp Ancistrocerus
   gazella took a similar period of time to provision cells in both field
   types. In addition, bee and wasp species of plant-species-poor fields
   were on average significantly larger than those of plant-species-rich
   fields. Thus, body size appeared to be a good predictor of colonization
   ability. Management by cutting greatly increased plant species richness
   in early-successional set-aside fields and thus doubled species richness
   of bees. Cutting of early-successional habitats can be expected to
   benefit insects and plants in general, whereas older grassland should
   show the greatest insect diversity when both mown and unmown parts are
   present.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of converting lowland tropical rainforest to pasture, and of
   subsequent succession of pasture lands to secondary forest, were
   examined in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica. Three replicate sites of
   each of four land-use types representing this disturbance-recovery
   sequence were sampled for changes in vegetation, pedological properties,
   and potential nitrogen mineralization and nitrification. The four
   land-use types included primary forest, actively grazed pasture (10-36
   yr old), abandoned pasture (abandoned 4-10 yr) and secondary forest
   (abandoned 10-20 yr).
   Conversion and succession had obvious and significant effects on canopy
   cover, canopy height, species composition, and species richness; it
   appeared that succession of secondary forests was proceeding toward a
   floristic composition like that of the primary forests. Significant
   changes in soil properties associated with conversion of forest to
   pasture included: (1) a decrease in acidity and increase in some base
   exchange properties, (2) an increase in bulk density and a concomitant  
   decrease in porosity, (3) higher concentrations of NH4+, (4) lower
   concentrations of NO3-, (5) lower rates of N-mineralization, and (6) in
   some cases, lower rates of nitrification.
   Chemical changes involving cations associated with conversion from
   forest to pasture indicated increases in soil fertility under the
   pasture regimes, while changes associated with nitrogen indicated
   decreases in fertility. Physical changes in density and porosity were
   deleterious with respect to infiltration, percolation, aeration, and,
   ultimately, erodability. Beyond the practical aspects of land
   management, many of these changes are very important to carbon and
   nitrogen cycling and to the emission and consumption of biogenic trace

Abstract = {{1. The preference of sheep for two temperate grassland species, ryegrass
   and white clover, was tested by releasing flocks (of three ewes) onto
   swards (0.25 ha) that contained adjacent monocultures of grass and
   clover, and observing their intake behaviour over 6 days. The test
   paddocks contained either 20, 50, or 80\% clover by ground area to
   distinguish partial preference from indifference.
   2. To test whether recent diet affected preference, separate groups of
   dry (non-pregnant, non-lactating) ewes grazed prior to testing on one of
   three diet `back-grounds': an all-grass sward, an all-clover sward, or a
   50:50 grass/clover sward by area. To consider the effects of
   physiological state on preference, a further group of lactating ewes,
   also from a 50:50 grass/clover `background', were tested.
   3. In all cases, the mean diet obtained was a mixture of grass and
   clover, even though greater intake rates would have been obtained eating
   pure clover. There was a consistent temporal pattern to preference, with
   ewes showing the greatest preference for clover in the morning. The
   results suggest that previous diet `background' can have lasting effects
   on preference. Ewes that had been recently grazing monocultures
   initially showed an increased preference for the opposite species to the
   one they had been grazing. Over 6 days these animals gradually reverted
   to a preference for their `background' diet.
   4. Despite major differences in the energy requirement and intake
   behaviour of dry vs. lactating ewes, no significant effects of
   physiological state on preference were detected. Sheep grazing from
   swards of 20\% clover spent a smaller proportion of time grazing clover
   and had a smaller proportion of clover in their diet than those grazing
   from 50\% or 80\% clover swards though, in all cases. behaviour was
   consistent with a preference for a high proportion of clover: sheep were
   not grazing at random.
   5. Overall, the results demonstrate that sheep sustain a mixed diet even
   in situations where a monospecific diet is readily possible. Several
   alternative hypotheses to explain this (partial preference, novelty,
   rarity, `sampling') are discussed. We suggest the results provide
   evidence of partial and changing preference by sheep. Our results urge
   caution in infering long-term grazing behaviour from short-term tests of
   preference and suggest why knowledge of diet preference even in common
   herbivores remains equivocal.}},

Abstract = {{1. The influence of inter-annual rainfall variability and cattle grazing
   on the abundance (density, basal area), population dynamics
   (recruitment, growth, survival) and population structure of the dominant
   perennial grasses of an African savanna was investigated from 1984 to
   1989. The unpalatable Aristida bipartita and the palatable Heteropogon
   contortus and Themeda triandra reproduce by seed; Bothriochloa insculpta
   reproduces mainly by seed, but sometimes by stolons; Digitaria eriantha
   can be stoloniferous; Setaria incrassata has rhizomatous growth.
   2. Species abundance was more responsive to rainfall variability than to
   grazing. Density increased in all species in response to several
   successive dry years because of recruitment and tuft fragmentation, but
   eventually decreased in a severe final drought year because of plant
   mortality. The response of basal cover differed between species and
   sites, although all species (except Digitaria) declined in the final
   drought year.
   3. Seedling recruitment, plant basal area, and mortality were likewise
   more strongly influenced by rainfall variability than by grazing.
   Differences in the population dynamics of species were related to their
   life history attributes. Aristida, a prolific seed producer, was
   favoured by grazing because high levels of seedling recruitment could be
   maintained. Seedling recruitment of palatable species (Heteropogon,
   Themeda) and of Bothriochloa was initially increased under heavy grazing
   because openings were produced within the vegetation, but this was
   reversed by the end of the study because of a decline in available seed.
   There was limited seedling recruitment of Digitaria and Setaria, but
   recruitment of Digitaria from stoloniferous growth increased population
   size, although there was no expansion of Setaria clones under the
   conditions of this study. Themeda and Aristida seedlings attained
   greater size under heavy than under light grazing.
   4. Mortality of all species increased over time, and was generally
   highest in the final severe drought year. Almost all mortality occurred
   in small individuals (<2-5 cm diameter) which had recently recruited or
   which had fragmented from existing tufts. Fragments of Aristida or
   Heteropogon were more likely to die than young tufts of the same size.
   The direction of the effect of grazing on mortality depended on year.
   Mean tuft size of most species decreased over time due to seedling
   recruitment and tuft fragmentation.
   5. The fraction of basal area after 5 years comprising individuals
   present at the start of the study, an index of population turnover, was
   greater than half for the seed reproducing species and Bothriochloa, and
   almost unity for Setaria (>98\%) and Digitaria (94\%). This fraction for
   seed-reproducing species was slightly less under heavy grazing.
   6. Thus, the pattern of community change was determined by the unique
   responses of recruitment, growth and mortality to rainfall variability
   and grazing among species. Heteropogon was almost eliminated and Themeda
   was markedly reduced by the combination of heavy grazing and drought.
   This supports the idea that palatable, seed-reproducing species may be
   prone to local extinction under such conditions because of increased
   mortality of mature plants and the diminishing availability of seed
   leading to diminished recruitment. The unpalatable Aristida showed
   irruptive behaviour under the same conditions because it could maintain
   seedling recruitment. Long-term experiments are required to separate the
   effects of rainfall and grazing on the demography of savanna grasses.}},

Abstract = {{The composition, diversity and structure of unfertilised temperate
   grassy communities were compared, after adjacent areas had been grazed
   or left ungrazed for 16 years. Life-history attributes of species in the
   two communities were also compared. Most species in both treatments were
   forbs, but these generally occurred with low frequencies and grasses
   formed the vegetation matrix. Native and perennial species predominated,
   reflecting pre-European conditions. Long-term, continuous grazing by
   sheep had opened the grass and litter canopy, promoted species richness
   and favoured a suite of morphological plant characteristics. Thus,
   species with dormant meristematic tissue at or below ground level, forbs
   of low stature and small tufted grasses were relatively common. The
   ungrazed treatment was densely vegetated, relatively species-poor and
   plants tended to have morphological attributes opposite to the above. A
   later, double-peaked flowering period in the ungrazed community was
   explained by the greater proportion of native perennials, versus the
   more common early-flowering exotic annuals in the grazed community. The
   larger proportion of vegetatively reproducing forbs in the ungrazed
   treatment reflected the density of the vegetation and the possible
   absence of appropriate sites for regeneration by seed, or the
   heterogenous distribution of resources available to interstitial plants.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents results of a three and a half year experiment in a

   availability, light conditions and grazing pressure were changed in a
   randomised experimental design with ten different combinations of these
   factors, including a control.  Weather conditions during the study
   period fluctuated considerably.  Only the combination of reduced light
   and increased soil nutrient availability decreased species richness
   significantly, presumably by inducing asymmetric competition for light
   by competitively strong species.  Physical space also became less
   available for weaker competitors.  In cases where only nutrients or only
   water were supplied in sufficient amounts, competitive exclusion was
   inhibited by either low nutrient or low water availability.  Under
   conditions which combined high levels of nutrient and water supply with
   regular disturbance (i.e. simulated grazing) high species richness was
   maintained.  Although there was a significant negative correlation
   between species richness and amount of above-ground biomass, the number
   of species was not significantly reduced in the treatment which combined
   fertilisation and irrigation.  One reason for this may be that the
   heterogeneous light regime in this treatment still allowed species
   persistence and coexistence.}},

Pages = {{123-168}},
Abstract = {{The vegetation of Campbell Island and its offshore islets was sampled
   quantitatively at 140 sites. Data from the 134 sites with more than one
   vascular plant species were subjected to multivariate analysis. Out of a
   total of 140 indigenous and widespread adventive species known from the
   island group, 124 vascular species were recorded; 85 non-vascular
   cryptogams or species aggregates play a major role in the vegetation. Up
   to 19 factors of the physical environment were recorded or derived for
   each site. Agglomerative cluster analysis of the vegetation data was
   used to identify 21 plant communities. These (together with cryptogam
   associations) include: maritime crusts, turfs, megaherbfields, tussock
   grasslands, and shrublands; mid-elevation swamps, flushes, bogs, tussock
   grasslands, shrublands, dwarf forests, and induced meadows; and upland
   tundra-like tussock grasslands, tall and short turf-herbfields, bogs,
   flushes, rock-ledge herbfields, and fellfields.
   Axis 1 of the DCA ordination is largely a soil gradient related to the
   eutrophying impact of marine spray, sea mammals and birds, and nutrient
   flushing. Axis 2 is an altitudinal (or thermal) gradient. Axis 3 is
   related to soil reaction and to different kinds of animal influence on
   vegetation stature and species richness, and Axis 4 also appears to have
   fertility and animal associations.
   Autecological interpretation of the data demonstrates clear niche
   segregation of congeneric species and ;species with similar growth
   forms. The notable megaherbs and giant tussocks may be an adaptation to
   harvesting nutrients from the aerosol precipitate. Heat harvesting in
   the cool, cloudy, wet, and windy climate may also be implicated. The
   history of farming and natural disturbances has resulted in a complex
   mosaic of vegetation-soil systems of varying maturity. Their putative
   dynamic interrelationships are depicted in terms of impacts of burning,
   grazing, marine animals and climate change and subsequent recovery or
   primary and secondary succession.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to compare small mammal populations and

   (Langxiang, Heilongjiang Province) and northwest Canada (Prince George,
   British Columbia). Populations were sampled on replicate live-trap grids
   during a period of high numbers of small mammals in autumn at each of
   the respective study areas. The brown-backed vole (Clethrionomys
   rufocanus) in China and the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) in
   Canada dominated their respective communities with Jolly-Seber
   population estimates ranging from 59 to 104 voles/ha. Secondary major
   species included the northern red-backed vole (C. rutilus), Japanese
   field mouse (Apodemus speciosus), and striped field mouse (A. agrarius)
   in China, and the boreal red-backed vole (C gapperi) and deer mouse
   (Peromyscus maniculatus) in Canada. Total average numbers of individuals
   were quite similar in each of the China (207) and Canada (209.5)
   communities. A greater biomass of small mammal species occurred at
   Langxiang (5.3 kg) than Prince George (4.2 kg) due to significantly
   larger body weights of C rufocanus and A. speciosus than M.
   pennsylvanicus and P. maniculatus, respectively. Diversity measurements
   were similar, but species richness was somewhat higher in the small
   mammal community at Prince George than Langxiang. There was generally a
   remarkable similarity in relative abundance and diversity of small
   mammal species occupying young cutover forest lands in northeast China
   and northwest Canada. This similarity suggests that the principles of
   managing temperate forests for wildlife diversity in North America could
   be applied to similar forests in Asia.}},

Abstract = {{Grasshopper assemblages were examined at 30 sites in southcentral Idaho,
   representing various degrees and types of disturbance.  These
   disturbances included heavy livestock grazing, wildfires, plowing,
   herbicide and applications, and seeding of introduced perennial
   bunchgrasses, mainly crested wheatgrass.  These disturbances resulted in
   the loss of sagebrush and native perennial grasses and has led to the
   establishment of exotic annual grasses and forbs on several sites.
   Grasshopper assemblages on sites dominated by annual vegetation were
   characterized by relatively high densities, low species diversity, and
   high proportions of species with broad diet breadths. Introduced
   perennial grass seedings were characterized by a high proportion of
   grass-feeding grasshopper species and high species diversity.
   Sagebrush-grass sites were characterized by lower grasshopper density
   and high species diversity. These results obtained under generally low
   grasshopper densities, suggest that rehabilitation of annual grasslands
   with perennial grasses and shrubs, and protection of endemic plant

Abstract = {{This study reports on small-scale changes in the distribution of plant
   species in a 2.5 m2 plot of grazed, species-rich Veronica spicata -
   Avenula pratensis grassland on shallow, dry, nutrient-poor soil in the
   Great Alvar area (Stora Alvaret) of southern Oland, southeastern Sweden.
   Multivariate analysis of 0.00 1 m2 and 0.25 m2 quadrats within the plot
   showed that there is little floristic variation without any trend in the
   plot. Average species richness varied little throughout the study period
   from 1986 to 1991 with 1986 averages of 7.0 on 0.001 m2, 16.3 on 0.01
   m2, and 26.1 on 0.25 m2. On 0.001 m2 the highest species number found
   was 12, on 0.01 m2, 27. However, cumulative species richness, i.e.
   species number in the first year plus new species appearing in later
   years (averaged over 40 quadrats) increased over the same period, on
   0.001 m2 from 7.0 in 1986 to 14.9 in 1991, and on 0.01 m2 from 16.3 to
   24.1. Cumulative frequency, i.e. number of quadrats out of 40 where a
   species occurred in the first year or/and in later years, increased as
   well; the number of cumulatively highly frequent (> 80\%) species
   increased from 5 in 1986 to 18 in 1991.
   Species mobility on the scale of the small quadrats used implies both
   appearance and disappearance from these quadrats. Using six examples,
   species mobility is shown to vary individualistically, both in rate and
   degree.
   We postulate that in homogeneous, grazed, nutrient- and water-deficient
   environments many species can reach virtually all microsites within the
   plot, which we express through the idea of the `carousel model'. We also
   question the usefulness of the niche concept and re-interpret it by
   stating that all species of this plant community have the same habitat
   niche, while most of them are short-lived and have the same regeneration
   niche. The essential variation amongst the species is their individual
   ability to establish or re-establish by making use of favourable
   conditions appearing in microsites in an unknown, complex
   spatio-temporal pattern.}},

   EXPERIMENTAL EFFECTS ON SPECIES COMPOSITION}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1993}},
Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{1. The effects of contrasting management practices on the species
   composition of tallgrass prairie in Kansas, USA are examined at two
   spatial scales. At the larger scale, the effects of 12 years of mowing
   and burning on five soil types (reflecting a topoedaphic gradient) were
   examined in 45 large-scale plots of 10000 m2. At the smaller scale, the
   effects of 3 years of burning, mowing and fertilizer were examined in 64
   plots of 100 m2 according to a split-plot design.
   2. Classification of the large-scale plots using TWINSPAN allowed the
   analytical level at which treatments could be resolved to be identified
   along with the corresponding indicator species. Soil type was shown to
   be the most important discriminator of plant communities with a
   separation of soil subgroups (Pachic Argiustolls and Udic Argiustolls)
   at the first level of classification. Burning separated plots at the
   second level of classification and mowing effects were not apparent
   until the third level of resolution. As management treatments, burning
   and mowing differed in their effect on species richness, especially the
   representation and number of exotic species.
   3. The species composition of the small-scale plots was affected
   primarily by mowing, followed by fertilizer and finally burning. Burning
   increased the abundance of some species (e.g. Andropogon scoparius) and
   decreased richness, but as an interaction with mowing or fertilizer. As
   at the larger scale, mowing allowed the incursion of exotic species
   (e.g. Andropogon bladhii).
   4. By studying the effects of management practices at different spatial
   and temporal scales, the generality of findings with respect to these
   scales was established. Equally important, the spatial scale at which
   particular treatment effects are manifest was also established. The
   inconsistency in the resolution of common management practices at the
   two scales in this study indicates a need to consider scale-dependent
   causal mechanisms in developing models of grassland structure.}},

Abstract = {{1. Grassland on lowland peat has considerable potential for agriculture
   and conservation.
   2. The limited use of fertilizer on the Somerset Moors, designated as an
   Environmentally Sensitive Area has enabled the impact on vegetation of
   applying a range of nitrogen levels to be investigated using a
   randomized block experiment with large plots at Tadham Moor.
   3. From 1986 to 1990, the plot measurements each year included the
   individual percentage cover of some 100 species; these enabled the
   derivation of a number of measures of plant community structure.
   4. The applications of fertilizer encouraged grasses (notably Lolium
   perenne and Holcus lanatus) which came to dominate the sward at the
   expense of most other species. All measures of species diversity
   declined significantly and the sward became taller in plots receiving
   high levels of nitrogen. Only a very few forbs (e.g. Rumex acetosa)
   maintained or increased their cover with increased nitrogen.
   5. All Carex species, Juncus species and mosses became significantly
   less common in plots treated with nitrogen, producing an apparently more
   mesotrophic sward. Short-lived species and low-growing wetland forbs
   also declined with nitrogen, perhaps due to shading by tall grasses.
   Legumes were suppressed by high levels of nitrogen, but were common in
   plots receiving 25 kg ha-1 year-1 N, where replacement levels of
   phosphorus and potassium were applied after cutting.
   6. Except for grasses, many species common in the experimental site in
   1986 declined in cover, particularly in plots receiving high levels of
   nitrogen. However, the data showed no instances of extinction by 1990.
   The application of 25 kg ha-1 N encouraged the spread of agriculturally
   productive grasses within 2 years and 50 kg ha-1 year-1 N significantly
   reduced species richness in 3 years.
   7. Certain detailed findings from this large-scale study of nitrogen
   application in meadows enable contrasts with previous results to be
   identified.}},

Abstract = {{1. A study is described in which two very low levels of fertilizer

   accelerate the colonization of a limestone quarry floor from an initial
   mean vegetation cover of 21.4\%. A factorial experiment was laid out
   with six randomized blocks, each with six plots. An `extra-fertilizer'
   treatment was added later by splitting the plots. 2. All treatment

   percentage cover of vegetation, species richness, species frequency and
   the number of species in flower. 3. There was virtually no change in
   mean percentage cover values in the control plots (no fertilizer,
   unrestricted grazing), but all the other treatments produced some
   increase. This was especially evident with all-year protection from
   grazing (increase to 52\%), and with combinations of protection plus

   plots increased significantly under 8 of the 12 treatments. Highest
   values resulted from double fertilizer applications with or without
   protection from summer grazing by rabbits. The double fertilizer
   combination gave the greatest number of species in flower. 5. Trends for
   individual species were examined and four classes of response to
   treatments are described, including declines attributed to competitive
   exclusion. 6. These results are discussed in relation to natural trends,
   and to management practices for maintaining or enhancing diversity in

Abstract = {{1. Patterns in the community structure and feeding guild composition
   among macroinvertebrates in the margins and riffles of 66 streams in
   upland Wales and Scotland were appraised and related to site chemistry,
   physiography and riparian management. We aimed to assess the
   effectiveness of riparian strips of broadleaves and moorland/grassland
   in protecting stream communities and their trophic function during
   commercial forestry.
   2. The composition of macroinvertebrate communities in margins and
   riffles most strongly reflected stream pH and aluminium concentrations;
   acidic riffles contained fewest species of all major macroinvertebrate
   groups. However, the character of marginal habitats had some influence
   on communities in stream margins through the presence of broadleaf trees
   or moorland/grassland vegetation in the riparian zone. Even at low pH,
   streams with moorland riparian zones had different macroinvertebrates
   from those with pure conifer.
   3. Stream chemistry was important in explaining patterns among feeding
   guilds. Species richness and abundances of grazers and filterers were
   reduced at acidic sites with high aluminium concentrations. The number
   of shredder species was significantly lower in riffles at low pH than at
   high pH.
   4. In contrast, marginal habitat structure was of overriding importance
   in explaining patterns among collectors and predators. These functional
   groups were most abundant at sites with riparian.zones of moorland and
   grassland, but scarce in streams where the bankside vegetation consisted
   of coniferous or broadleaved trees. Total grazer abundances were lowest
   at sites with riparian zones of pure conifer.
   5. We conclude that riparian management can modify effects of forestry
   on the trophic dynamics and structure of the macroinvertebrate
   communities of upland streams, but the effect operates within a strong
   gradient due to acidity. Thus, the array of macroinvertebrates which may
   benefit from riparian management in forest streams is liable to be
   restricted by low pH.
   6. We discuss the wider ramifications of riparian management for the
   conservation of streams during commercial forestry. In particular we
   assess if management proposals set out by the forestry industry are
   supported. We also discuss the problem of scale when considering
   measures implemented for stream conservation, emphasizing that the
   control of problems such as acidification may only be possible at a
   regional level.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetation mowing is usually recommended for preserving wet meadows, in
   particular for the prevention of land warping and brushwood
   encroachment. The concept and the methods for the study of the influence
   of different cutting rhythms on the vegetation of two wet meadows, as
   well as some short term results are presented. Cutting experiments with
   permanent plots have been undertaken in vegetation communities such as
   Orchio-Schoenetum nigricantis and Caricetum elatae, abandoned for many
   years. The strategy of the study was to have diverse but complementary
   methodological approaches in order to assess changes in the vegetation
   and species abundance, especially concerning the botanical composition,
   the vegetation structure and the species vitality. The methods include
   counting of plants or part of plants, morphometry of Phragmites
   communis, biomass measurements, phenological records, structure releves
   with the point-intercept technique as well as classical vegetation
   releves with coverage estimation.
   On a short term base we can conclude, on the whole, that the yearly
   winter cut treatment induces a better vitality (number of individuals,
   flowering, biomass) of the studied species, while in the control plots
   the vitality is low, due notably to the important layer of accumulating
   litter and the lack of light on the ground, which hamper soil warming.
   The yearly summer cut treatment and the winter cut made every three
   years show in general intermediate characteristics. Furthermore, the
   vegetation structure is noticeably different according to whether the
   vegetation is cut (with hay removal) or not. Concerning the methodology,
   it is concluded that a diverse approach is a good way to assess changes
   in the vegetation with a minimum loss of information. If the rather
   subjective method of vegetation releves with cover estimation may be
   suitable for long term survey on permanent plots, more quantitative and
   objective techniques have to be set if short term or precise changes in
   the botanical composition, the species vitality and the biomass, as well
   as structural changes, are sought.}},

Abstract = {{None of seven existing theories seeking to explain the coexistence of
   plant species, could singly explain the pattern of species richness
   found e.g. in calcicolous grasslands. A more general explanation of
   species coexistence utilizes an idealized concept, the null community,
   defined as an undisturbed community within stable zonal vegetation
   including the whole pool of potential species. The number of potential
   species will then be dependent mainly on evolutionary factors
   (speciation, species traits). The majority of `real' communities have a
   smaller species pool for historical reasons - migration has not taken
   place. Within this local species pool, asymmetric interspecific
   competition is the main force reducing species richness. Competition
   takes place on an ecological level (within an ecological time scale),
   but the outcome of it is governed by evolutionarily determined traits of
   individuals.
   Ecological factors influence the number of coexisting species under two
   circumstances - when habitat conditions are changing and one species
   pool replaces another, or when some external factor (such as grazing or
   mowing) changes the traits of individuals, thus altering the outcome of
   competition.
   Present theories operate with only one factor - evolutionary, historical
   or ecological. In the framework of the generalized approach presented
   here each of these theories is useful to explain species coexistence on
   certain levels and under particular conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A forest harvesting system using skyline cables was evaluated for its
   effect on secondary forest structure and tree species richness of
   lowland rain forests in the Bajo Calima Concession, western Colombia.
   Forests were sampled using six 0.1 ha plots in mature primary forest and
   sites 0.4, 4, 8 and 12 years since logging. Clear-cutting reduced
   overstory (trees greater than or equal to 10 cm dbh) basal area, biomass
   and richness to 7\%, 4\%, and 17\%, respectively, of primary forest
   levels. By the twelfth year 46\% of basal area, 37\% of biomass, and
   38\% of richness had returned. However, 63\% of biomass and 50\% of
   richness were composed of `core pioneer' species. The replacement of
   primary (climax) species dominants by pioneer species indicates that the
   early process of regeneration is more appropriately described as
   secondary succession. Age since clear-cutting during the first 12 years
   of growth was a significant linear predictor of both pioneer and climax
   species biomass and basal area, but not climax richness. Extrapolation
   of these trends beyond 12 years suggests that overstory basal area and
   biomass would equal that of mature rain forests by 30 years (the
   proposed rotation time). However, the decline in pioneer growth rates
   over time, the slow climax growth rates, and the failure to predict
   observations in an 18-year-old stand indicate that such a model is
   unrealistic. Climax species need longer than 30 years to recover, and
   biomass may decline between 15 and 30 years if many short-lived pioneer
   trees die before climax trees are well established. More consideration
   needs to be given to understanding the regeneration of climax species if
   conservation and harvesting are to be combined. Putting part of the
   concession under a longer rotation time may permit climax trees to
   regenerate successfully.}},

   alien species were recorded, two Eurasian grasses, Phleum pratense and
   Poa pratensis, being particularly common in most of the study sites. In
   sites adjacent to primary and secondary roads, alien species richness
   declined out to the most distant transect, suggesting that alien species
   are successfully invading grasslands from the roadside areas. In study
   sites adjacent to backcountry trails, absence of a comparable decline
   and unexpectedly high levels of alien species richness 100 m from the

Abstract = {{This paper describes up to two decades of unassisted plant recovery from
   uncontrolled tracked-vehicle disturbance within tundra meadows on two
   physiographically distinct high-arctic coastal lowlands. Data are
   presented which emphasize the status of species-richness and
   above-ground vascular biomass. Although they exhibit similar vascular
   floristics, the undisturbed vegetation communities of the two sites
   differ greatly in terms of the abundance of dominant species. In
   particular, Salix spp. characterize the larger, more mesic hummocks of
   the Baffin Island site, while Cyperaceae characterize the more level and
   generally wetter meadows on Devon Island. Despite these differences,
   both vascular and cryptogamic species-richness are consistently reduced
   under a variety of low-intensity disturbance regimes in different
   vegetation-types. In many cases these reductions are significant. In
   addition, total vascular biomass is significantly reduced in 88\% of all
   stands. Reductions are most severe among woody species and, in cases
   where the biomass of monocotyledons was increased, these increases were
   more than offset by the losses among dicotyledons. This is contrary to
   the situation in mesic low-arctic meadows, where significant biomass
   increases among graminoids have more than offset losses among
   dicotyledons after less than 8 growing-seasons.
   The literature of mechanical disturbance in the high-arctic is briefly
   reviewed, and it is noted that few long-term data are available, there
   being virtually none which address either cryptogamic species-richness
   or vascular biomass. The data presented here reaffirm previous
   short-term findings that lateral reinvasion by rhizomatous graminoids is
   slower than in the low-arctic. In addition, it has been determined that
   even after 18-20 years, seedling establishment by dicotyledons is
   virtually lacking in multi-pass tracks, and is limited to only the
   driest microsites (hummock tops and sides) in single-pass tracks. The
   few colonists are mostly slow-growing, woody species and are not likely
   to recover to predisturbance levels of biomass in mesic sites in the
   foreseeable future.
   The prospect for a natural return to predisturbance levels of
   species-richness among cryptogams is equally unlikely, as the
   microhabitats in which many of them were found are often significantly
   reduced in extent or are lacking altogether. In some cases, ruderal
   bryophytes that are not found in the undisturbed formation have
   colonized the disturbed substrates, that are apparently not being
   invaded by the original species - further exacerbating natural
   restoration.
   At present, most of these impacts occur on a limited spatial scale,
   although cumulative impacts were also documented. However, even small
   patches recover quite slowly and with fewer species than were originally
   present. Bared surfaces, or strips, if larger than about 1 m across are,
   typically, invaded from the edges inwards, few types other than ruderal
   grasses (e.g. species of Phippsia and Alopecurus not found in the
   undisturbed formation) being able to colonize the centre. Only the
   wettest meadows, which are naturally poor in species, approach or match
   former levels of species-richness and vascular biomass.
   Given that these impacts are of limited extent and relatively low
   intensity, by comparison with large-scale resource exploration and
   minerals' extraction, the findings indicate that the meadows of the
   high-arctic need to be considered separately from their low-arctic
   counterparts when planning for even the most mitigative developments.
   Many of Canada's high-arctic lowlands provide important seasonal or
   year-around habitats for the region's terrestrial herbivores, yet only
   one has received any legislative protection. As pressure continues to
   build-up for increased access to the region for purposes of resource
   exploitation (Hazell, 1991), wilderness recreation (MacLachlan, 1988),
   and military sovereignty (Hazell, 1991), it is worth considering the
   ability of the more productive components of these ecosystems to recover
   from even a fraction of the impacts which, unfortunately, we may expect
   them to incur.}},

Abstract = {{Relationships between local annual immigration and extinction rates of
   plant species and total species richness were determined from long-term
   data in permanent plots in tallgrass and shortgrass prairies in Kansas. 
   Combining plots resulted in higher equilibrium numbers of species as
   predicted from immigration and extinction rates.  Immigration and
   extinction rates also increased with scale.  Extinction rates are higher
   because the regional scale supports more rare species which, in turn,
   have high probabilities of extinction.  We also tested the hypotheses
   that extinction rates would be higher on burned versus unburned
   grasslands, and that immigration rates would be higher on grazed versus
   ungrazed grasslands.  Extinction rates were positively correlated with
   the number of species at a site, and this relationship was not altered
   by burning or grazing.  Immigration rates were variable, but were
   sometimes positively correlated with growing season precipitation. 
   Immigration rates decreased in years sites were burned.  Therefore,
   after fire, the number of species going locally extinct was still
   dependent on earlier species richness, but the number of species added
   to the site was reduced.  Variances in immigration and extinction rates
   were high, therefore, confident predictions regarding the effects of
   burning or grazing regimes on species richness could not be made. 
   Variance in rates of immigration and extinction results in a range of
   values within which the equilibrium number of species fluctuates

Abstract = {{We studied bird use of actively grazed and abandoned (2-4 years)
   pastures during February 1990 in Belize, where pastures often are
   maintained by repeated mowing. A total of 46 species was observed in the
   two pasture types, with 15 species detected in grazed and 39 in
   abandoned. Species richness for both migrants and residents was lower by
   > 50\% in grazed pastures. Overall abundance of birds was lower by
   nearly 70\% in grazed pastures compared with the more structurally
   diverse abandoned pastures (P < 0.001). Based on data from a concurrent
   study on bird use of forest interior habitat in Belize, 2-4 times more
   resident species would be expected in nearby broadleaved forests
   compared to an equal census effort in grazed pastures. In contrast, only
   about 1.5 times more migrant bird species would be predicted in
   broadleaved forest interior than in grazed pastures. Foraging guilds
   were not equally represented between pasture treatments; most notable
   was an absence of frugivores and nectarivores in grazed pastures
   maintained by mowing. Our results indicate that retention of some shrubs
   and overstory trees may reduce the negative effects of pasture
   development of winter bird populations in Central America.}},

   were applied to plots on two soil types. Fertilized control plots had
   the fewest species in both vegetation and seed bank while the most were
   found in the unfertilized grazed and mowed plots. Despite large losses
   of species from the vegetation in some treatments, few of the species
   lost were found in the seed bank. Of the 48 taxa identified from the
   seed bank, only Alchemilla sp., Hypericum maculatum, Luzula sp.,
   Saxifraga granulata, Urtica dioica and Veronica sp. had large persistent

Title = {{LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF EXCLUDING SHEEP FROM HILL PASTURES IN NORTH WALES}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{1992}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-13}},
Abstract = {{1. From 1957 to 1968 a series of nine experiments was established to
   determine the effects of excluding sheep from hill pasture in Snowdonia.
   Each experiment consisted of three ungrazed plots and six grazed control
   plots. Species abundance was recorded non-destructively by cover pins
   during 1958-81. In autumn 1982, two of the experiments were completely
   fenced; vegetation changes in the formerly grazed plots were recorded by
   herbage sampling from 1981 to 1990.
   2. Successional changes depended strongly on the soil and initial
   vegetation of the site. Compositional change in grasslands initially
   dominated by Agrostis capillaris and Festuca ovina was smaller than in
   vegetation initially dominated by Nardus stricta and Festuca ovina, and
   was less obviously driven by coarser plants overtopping short ones.
   3. There was almost no invasion of new plant species, the only
   exceptions being Sorbus aucuparia, which was associated with bird
   perches on fences, Dryopteris dilatata, which emerged in tussocky
   grassland, and Solidago virgaurea, which may have spread to one site
   from nearby cliffs. The invaders played no important part in the
   succession.
   4. Early changes were relatively rapid, with the character of the
   vegetation altering markedly over about 7 years. Low-growing plants such
   as Danthonia decumbens, Juncus squarrosus, Trifolium repens and
   Polytrichum commune declined consistently, as did the biennial Cirsium
   palustre.
   5. Longer-term changes in the herbaceous vegetation were few. Suppressed
   shrubs of Calluna vulgaris and Erica cinerea grew into full-sized
   bushes, which at one site flourished for 20 and 12 years, respectively,
   before degenerating, but at other sites coalesced to achieve local
   dominance.
   6. In the absence of sheep, voles became the dominant herbivore and
   caused large year-to-year variation in herbage biomass. Agrostis
   vinealis and Holcus mollis were less damaged by voles than A.
   capillaris. Established tussocks of Molinia caerulea were also little
   affected. In years of high vole abundance the pleurocarpous mosses
   Hylocomium splendens and Pleurozium schreberi increased greatly among
   mats of dead grass.}},

Abstract = {{1. The patterns of recolonization   of bare-ground gaps within subalpine
   grassland, open grassy heath and closed heath are described for the
   Bogong High Plains in south-eastern Australia. 2. Bare-ground gaps
   within grassland and open grassy heath ranged from 5 to 40 cm in
   diameter, and occurred between tussocks of the dominant Poa hiemata. In
   comparison, bare-ground gaps within closed heath ranged from 0-5 to 2cm
   in diameter. 3. Colonists of gaps included shrubs, forbs and graminoids.
   Establishment was by both vegetative means and seedlings, with the
   latter most common in shrubs. The diversity of forbs was greatest in
   gaps within grassland and open heath. Seedling shrubs were the
   predominant colonists of gaps in closed heath. 4. Gap size affected both
   species richness and the nature of the seedling populations within both
   grassland and open heath. Species richness increased with increasing gap
   area. Shrub seedlings were more common in gaps > 30 cm in diameter,
   whereas Poa hiemata seedlings were more common in gaps < 15 cm in
   diameter. In closed heath there was no clear relationship between gap
   area, species richness or seedling composition. 5. The density of shrub
   seedlings in gaps within grassland varied considerably from site to
   site, and may have been related to dispersal of seeds and the trampling
   and browsing effects of domestic cattle.}},

Abstract = {{(1) The effects of different cereal and grass management regimes on
   summer staphylinid assemblages were examined in hay meadows, lightly
   grazed pastures, silage fields, spring cereals, and winter cereals with
   routine pesticide application in south-west Ireland.
   (2) Forty-nine sites were sampled for adult Staphylinidae using pitfall
   traps and a D-vac suction sampler in June and July 1986.  Comparisons
   between sites using species composition data were carried out using
   detrended correspondence analysis.
   (3) Large differences in staphylinid assemblages occurred between
   undisturbed meadows and pastures (without cultivation, cutting, heavy
   grazing and fertilizer use), and disturbed silage fields and cereals. 
   The latter were rapidly recolonized after physical disturbance such as
   cutting and cultivation, once a vegetation layer was re-established. 
   The assemblages of second-cut silage fields, spring cereals with a
   well-developed canopy, and of winter cereals, were very similar.
   (4) Dimethoate application resulted in a reduction in species richness
   in cereals, and there were more species in small fields, although the
   latter was due to the occurrence of species which were rare overall in
   cereals.  No effect of propiconazole, the most frequently used
   fungicide, was detected.
   (5) Rapid recolonization in heteregeneous landscapes, as in this study,
   may lessen the perceived impact of disturbance factors, which may have a
   much greater impact in more homogeneous landscapes.  Nonetheless, the
   results indicate that, with careful site selection, multivariate
   analysis of staphylinid species composition data can be a useful
   supplementary technique to experimental plot studies.}},

Abstract = {{(1) Current agricultural overproduction in Western Europe has led to an
   increase in the area of unfertilized grassland.  This paper reports an
   experiment where fertilizer application was stopped to try to restore
   former species-rich vegetation.
   (2) Standing crop and species composition of three different fields were
   studied during the first 14 years after cessation of fertilizer
   application.  In two fields on peaty soil a strong decrease in standing
   crop (from 800 to 300 g m-2) was observed but in a field on sandy soil,
   the initial production of 300 g m-2 did not decrease.  The deviations
   from the mean between years were significantly correlated to the
   potential water surplus in the growing season in this latter field, but
   not for the two fields on peaty soil.  The species composition changed
   gradually in all fields.
   (3) In the two fields with decreasing standing crop, species-richness
   per field and per 4-m2 plot increased markedly during the 14 years.  A
   maximum of forty species was observed after 8 years in the field on
   sandy soil.
   (4) Several species reached their maximum cover during these
   successions.  The dynamics of species replacement was described using a
   Guassian response model for each species.  Species indicating
   nutrient-poor conditions entered earlier in the successional sequence
   with cutting twice a year and in the field on sandy soil.  The results
   are discussed with regard to diversity-productivity relationships,

   relative abundance during the breeding season in 44 grassed waterways in
   central Iowa. The waterways were planted predominately to smooth brome
   (Bromus inermis) and were in cornfields and soybean fields. Forty-eight
   bird species were observed in waterways, compared with only 14 in the
   surrounding crop fields. Red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus),
   dickcissels (Spiza americana), barn swallows (Hirundo rustica), western
   meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus
   ater), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) and song sparrows
   (Melospiza melodia) were the most abundant bird species in the grassed
   waterways. Total bird abundance in the grassed waterways averaged 2198
   birds observed/census/100 ha compared with 682 in crop fields. Temporal
   patterns in bird abundance were attributed primarily to aspects of the
   waterways and surrounding cropland that changed over time, such as
   vegetation height. Because most (53\%) of the bird species were at peak
   abundance in the waterways during 4-22 july, grassed waterways should
   not be mowed until the end of August or early September.}},

Abstract = {{(1) Eighty-six examples of rich-fen vegetation, representing the main
   types of herbaceous rich-fen plant communities of lowland England and
   Wales, were sampled to determine above-ground crop-mass components. (2)
   Above-ground standing crop (living material) (SC) and litter (dead
   material) was estimated by harvesting clipped material near the start
   (April) and end (September) of the main growing season and the increment
   of above-ground standing crop ('production') was calculated. (3)
   September standing crop and litter-mass values ranged from 80 to 2918 g
   m-2 and 37 to 2115 g m-2, respectively. The April-September net standing
   crop increment ranged from 58 to 2799 g m-2. Communities of highest
   production were almost always deciduous and had very small April
   standing crop mass. Conversely most low productivity stands had
   proportionately large April SC mass, reflecting their winter-green
   character. (4) Stands with greatest September standing crop usually had
   small proportions of September litter, probably because of rapid
   decomposition. An exception to this was some stands dominated by Cladium
   mariscus where large September standing crop and litter mass was
   combined. Some of these stands had the greatest total crop mass
   (maximum: 5011 g m-2). (5) All crop variables except April SC showed a
   significant negative relationship with species density (number of spp. 4
   m-2) in regressions (log(c)-transformed variables). April-September SC
   increment (36\%) and September SC (32\%) accounted for most variation in
   species density in single regressions. A stepwise multiple-regression
   model included only the SC increment term. The poorer fit of September
   SC mass probably occurred because, unlike SC increment, some samples of
   high September SC were relatively species rich, partly a legacy of
   former, or present rotational, management. (6) When `rare fen species
   score' (number of rare species 4 m-2 was the dependent variable, similar
   relationships were found but the crop mass variables generally accounted
   for rather less of its variation. The slopes of the regression equations
   were significantly (P < 0.05) steeper than those using species density,
   and samples with large crop mass had particularly few, if any, rare
   species. (7) Maintenance of low-growing swards of herbaceous fen
   vegetation is particularly important for the conservation of many rare
   fen species.}},

Abstract = {{The question of which factors limit the occurrence of a plant species to
   a particular site is addressed by considering 53 cases in which the
   distribution of pines (Pinus species; Pinaceae) has changed in the last
   century. We consider expansions of pines in and adjacent to their
   natural ranges in the Northern Hemisphere and the spread from sites of
   introduction in the Southern Hemisphere well outside the contemporary
   range of pines. We first consider a neutral hypothesis (with respect to
   climate or biological interactions as determinants of invasion):
   invasion simply requires that a species is present in sufficient
   numbers, with sufficient propagules over sufficient time to invade. We
   then explore the relative importance of climatic changes. disturbance,
   competition (including competition between seedlings and herbaceous
   plants during early establishment), herbivory, pathogens, and other
   agents that might influence pine membership in communities. Determinants
   of susceptibility to invasion often interact in a complex fashion.
   Environmental stresses created by moisture and temperature appear to
   exercise primary control on invasibility at xeric and high-elevation
   sites, respectively, but play a smaller role at intermediate locations.
   At these sites, range limits are determined principally by interactions
   between pine seedlings and the resident biota in adjacent communities.
   This suggests that the effects of predicted global warming on the
   distribution of pines are unlikely to be simple functions of temperature
   or precipitation. except at climatic extremes. Pine invasions are most
   prevalent where there is limited competition in the regeneration niche
   and occur more easily in habitats where the dominant growth form is most
   different from that of pines, namely, in grasslands. The disturbance
   regime in the receiving habitat is important and interacts directly and
   indirectly with the ``inherent{''} susceptibility to invasion. Severe
   disturbances may initiate pine invasions at any latitude, but are
   essential for reducing the cover of vigorous plant growth (and hence
   competition in the regeneration niche) in tropical and near-tropical
   regions. Contemporary practices such as deforestation and increased
   grazing pressure and those practices leading to accelerated erosion,
   modified fire regimes, and climate amelioration essentially duplicate
   ice-age stresses and disturbances that shaped plant communities in the
   Holocene. The fundamental role of biotic factors (either direct or
   indirect) in regulating the distribution of pines is discussed with
   reference to aspects of land husbandry including the management of
   biological invasions.}},

Volume = {{93}},

Abstract = {{It is proposed that evaluations of disturbance effects upon community
   diversity will be influenced by two factors currently overlooked in
   models addressing disturbance-diversity relationships:  (1) the spatial
   scale of inquiry, and (2) the level of the species abundance (dominance)
   hierarchy at which the search for diversity is done.  We analyzed how
   two disturbance types - cattle grazing and large flooding - affected
   community diversity at two spatial scales (stand and patch) and three
   levels of species dominance in a grassland of the Flooding Pampa,
   Argentina.  The effect of disturbance interaction was also examined. 
   Species diversity at the stand scale was reduced by either grazing or
   flooding.  Both disturbances decreased community spatial heterogeneity. 
   At the patch scale, diversity declined with flooding but was enhanced by
   grazing.  Flooding increased diversity under grazing conditions. 
   However, stand diversity was highest in the undisturbed grassland;
   pattern diversity was the salient feature in this condition.  The
   combination of disturbances yielded the highest patch-scale diversity;
   grazing increased richness whilst flooding enhanced evenness. 
   Comparisons among grassland conditions appeared scale-dependent. 
   Moreover, the extent of disturbance effects varied with the level of
   dominance hierarchy considered.  We point out the relevance of site
   history and initial conditions, encompassing the possibility of
   disturbances interaction, to the patterns produced by disturbance
   events.  Effects perceived at different spatial scales, or in species
   positioned at separate dominance levels, may parallel meaningful changes
   in the relative importance of factors controlling species coexistence
   and community organization.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of intensive grazing on 57 species of Gramineae was studied

   4 species were more abundant in grazed stands when compared to ungrazed
   stands.  In cerrado, the total number of species in grazed stands was
   significantly reduced and the unpalatable grass, Elionurus muticus, was
   the dominant species in both grazed and ungrazed stands.  The relatively
   palatable grasses, Thrasya petrosa, Schizachyrium microstachyum, and
   Schizachyrium sanguineum were important constituent species of cerrado
   and were the most negatively affected by selective grazing.  Savanna
   wetland and semideciduous forest communities lack a single dominant

Abstract = {{The colonization and community development of Orthoptera on a series of

   adjacent, undisturbed shrub-steppe site also was sampled. The reclaimed
   mines represented a series of sites ranging in age (after revegetation)
   from 0 to 6 yr. We found that the mine sites exhibited lower index
   values for species richness (R, 6-15), diversity (H', 0.07-0.68) and
   evenness (J', 0.09-0.60) than the undisturbed site (R, 19; H', 0.79;
   0.62). Community similarity indices (Bray-Curtis coefficients) indicated
   a low similarity between any mine site and the undisturbed shrub-steppe
   site. Cluster analysis revealed three major faunal assemblages on the
   mine sites that corresponded closely to vegetational changes: on two
   young sites dominated by annual forbs (greater-than-or-equal-to 34\%
   cover) with little grass (less-than-or-equal-to 12\% cover), there
   existed a depauperate funa dominated by Ceuthophilus alpinus Scudder
   (Gryllacrididae); on one site with an even mix of forbs and grasses
   (33\% and 21\% cover, respectively), the Acrididae and Gryllacrididae
   were codominant; and on the four older sites dominated by grasses
   (greater-than-or-equal-to 38\% cover, virtually no forbs), C. alpinus
   was again the dominant species, although substantial numbers of acridids
   were also present. Correlations of Orthoptera species richness and
   diversity with plant species richness and diversity produced significant
   positive relationships. The dominant grasshopper species on the mine
   sites are listed as ``Economically Important Pest Species{''} by the
   USDA and may hinder successful establishment of young plants on reseeded
   minelands during periods favorable to grasshopper reproduction and
   survival. It is suggested, however, that, in the absence of significant
   grazing by native wildlife or livestock, these herbivorous and

Abstract = {{The bryophyte flora of the Dutch chalk grasslands has been strongly
   impoverished in the recent past. The bryophyte layer of plots of several
   management experiments was investigated 1) to indicate an appropriate
   management regime to regenerate a species-rich bryophyte layer and 2) to
   estimate the relative importance of several sources of diaspores in the
   establishment of bryophyte species (i.e.. spreading of local
   populations, the local diaspore bank in the soil, and transport by air).
   In abandoned chalk grasslands dominated by the grass Brachypodium
   pinnatum, species richness increased strongly within three years after
   introduction of mowing. In yearly-mown chalk grasslands an increase of
   the number of species was observed in plots that were clipped twice or
   even four times a year. In all experiments the creation of a lower, more
   open phanerogam canopy seemed to explain the increase of bryophyte
   species. The invading species were mainly colonists and annual shuttle
   species. Their diaspores presumably originated from the local diaspore
   bank or from populations in the same chalk grassland or its direct
   neighbourhood. Invasion of species that were not known from the direct
   surroundings of the chalk grasslands was not observed. Invasion by
   perennial bryophytes was also nearly absent.
   It is concluded that, in many chalk grasslands, species richness of the
   bryophyte layer can be increased, although the original species richness
   will not be attained again.}},
