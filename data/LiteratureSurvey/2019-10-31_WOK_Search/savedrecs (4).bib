Title = {{Grazing land management and biodiversity in the Atlantic European

Abstract = {{Atlantic heaths are semi-natural habitats of high biodiversity interest
   which once covered large areas of the Atlantic Region. Nowadays these
   heathlands are dramatically reduced in many countries although they
   still cover wide areas in the north-west Iberian Peninsula, especially
   in the poorest and most socially marginal areas that are frequently
   affected by wildfires. We review the role of livestock grazing as a
   sustainable management strategy for heathlands in Europe. We have worked
   on a generalized conceptual framework for the management of a resource
   of nutritional and environmental value by drawing together evidence from
   studies of the livestock and the community ecology of grazed plants and
   the associated fauna. Key factors that influence grazing impact, such as
   type of livestock (animal species and breed) and their management are
   discussed. Goats thrive better than sheep, and horses than cattle, when
   heathland vegetation is the predominant resource available. Regardless
   of the type of livestock species managed, the low nutritive value of
   this vegetation hinders the maintenance of productive groups of suckler
   dams with offspring through the grazing season. The nutritional
   requirements of livestock can be met by adding improved pasture areas to
   heathlands. Under that strategy, sheep have the best productive
   performance and cattle the poorest. Management of mixed flocks with
   goats can lead to a more efficient use of vegetation, improve
   productivity and develop a patchier habitat which supports a richer
   associated fauna. Overall the results indicate that the sustainability
   of livestock grazing in these marginal lands will be achieved if they
   are managed effectively according to the available vegetation and their
   effects on the biodiversity.}},

Title = {{Using Auchenorrhyncha (Insecta: Hemiptera) to develop a new insect index
   in measuring North American tallgrass prairie quality}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{58-64}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Auchenorrhyncha (i.e., leafhoppers, treehoppers, spittlebugs, and
   planthoppers) represent some of the most diverse groups of herbivorous
   insects in the tallgrass prairie biome, they have close associations
   with many native prairie grasses and forbs, and respond in predictable
   ways to changes in native grassland degradation. These attributes make
   Auchenorrhyncha ideal candidates in the development of a habitat quality
   index to measure tallgrass prairie quality. In this study we propose the
   development of a species-based habitat quality index called the
   Auchenorrhyncha quality index or AQI as a useful method in tracking the
   condition of tallgrass prairie quality. The AQI is computed by summing
   six ecological characteristics (i.e., host plant specificity, voltinism,
   overwintering microhabitat, wing length, habitat fidelity, and origin)
   for each Auchenorrhynchan insect encountered, yielding coefficient of
   conservatism (CC) values that range from 0 (habitat generalist/tolerant
   to disturbance) to 18 (habitat specific/intolerant to disturbance).
   These CC values are averaged and combined with species richness
   producing un-weighted by abundance AQI (AQI(w/outN)) and weighted by
   abundance AQI (AQI(w/N)). The performance of the AQI was evaluated by
   examining the effects of sampling intensity on this index using a sweep
   net and a vacuum apparatus from 10 sites located on the three main North
   American tallgrass prairie communities, wet-mesic, sand, and loess hill.
   Scientists and land managers can adequately sample Auchenorrhyncha from
   four transects using a vacuum. Also, the highest AQI values were found
   from loess hill and sand prairies, indicating that conservation efforts
   should focus on these prairie communities. Additional applications of
   the AQI may include: (1) discriminating prairie quality at various
   spatial scales; (2) testing hypotheses about the effects of disturbance
   on prairie habitat (e.g. prescribed burning); (3) using the AQI as a
   model in developing habitat quality indices based on other diverse
   groups of grassland insects: and (4) the AQI has the capacity to be
   readily modified in assessing the quality of other biomes. Ultimately,
   the AQI should be used in combination with other habitat quality indices
   based on other diverse groups of organisms, such as plants and other
   insects, to provide a more complete assessment of native habitat
   quality. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Large grazing herbivores have been reported to determine the structure
   and function of grassland ecosystems. However, the ecological linkages
   between structure and functioning components have yet been thoroughly
   explored. Here, we test the hypothesis of the impact of grazing on soil
   nematode community (e.g. structure and composition) and linkages to
   ecosystem functioning (e.g. soil N mineralization and ANPP) via changes
   in pathways of plant community, soil nutrients and soil environment
   using a field experiment maintained for 5years with seven levels of
   grazing intensity in the Inner Mongolian grassland. A structural
   equation model (SEM) with nematode abundances as response variables
   showed that plant-feeding and fungal-feeding nematodes were driven by
   changes in the plant community, and bacterial-feeding nematodes were
   affected by soil abiotic nutrients and environment, while
   omnivorous+carnivorous nematodes were altered by soil environment and
   bacterial-feeding nematodes. This indicates that the top-down control by
   grazing leads to bottom-up control in the soil food web. We found that
   grazing affected the ecosystem functioning via different pathways.
   Grazing effects soil N mineralization by changing plant community, soil
   nutrients, soil environment and nematodes community structure, while it
   affects ANPP by altering soil N mineralization and soil environment. Our
   findings could provide a better understanding of the responses of plants
   and soils to grazing and the linkages between structure and functioning
   of above-ground and below-ground in the semi-arid steppe.}},

Abstract = {{This study was aimed at understanding the fodder utilization pattern,
   energy budget, and problems related to fodder biomass harvesting in six
   villages located along an altitudinal gradient (12003000 m.a.s.l.) in
   Govind Wildlife Sanctuary (GWS). Forests provided 68\% of total fodder
   used compared to 32\% from agriculture. The highest average fodder
   consumption was observed in the village Osla (38.8 +/- 3.7
   kg/household/day) in subalpine region and the lowest in Gainchwangaon
   (31.3 +/- 2.3 kg/household/day) in subtropical region. As the altitude
   increased from subtropical to subalpine, the amounts of leaf fodder
   collected increased and a similar trend was also observed for fodder
   consumption pattern by the livestock in the study area. The labor energy
   spent in fodder collection was recorded as a maximum (620.06
   MJ/household/year) for the village of Naitwar in the subtropical region
   and a minimum (364.84 MJ/household/year) for the village of Osla in the
   subalpine region. The period of intensity of grazing and lopping at
   present is decided in arbitrary fashion by the authorities of the GWS in
   the absence of quantitative information on spatial variability in the
   availability and collection of fodder. The detailed quantitative
   information on the amount of fodder collection and consumption in
   different vegetation zones and associated labor costs presented in this
   study would be quite helpful in developing GWS management plans which
   favor grazing regimes not detrimental to the biodiversity and ecosystem
   services of currently healthy forests and alpine meadows and which
   reduce deforestation and the drudgery of village women folk through
   developing agroforestry on village common/private degraded lands in the

Abstract = {{River basins are among the most threatened ecosystems. The species
   diversity of several European river basins decreased seriously during
   the last decade due to loss of habitats and increasing land use pressure
   on the remaining habitats. We studied true bug assemblages in various
   land use types of grassland fragments and dikes as linear grassland
   habitats in the agricultural landscape of the lower reach of the Tisza
   River Basin. We tested the effects of the recorded variables of habitat
   quality, surrounding landscape and land use type on the abundance,
   species richness and composition of true bugs. Altogether, 5,389 adult
   Heteroptera individuals representing 149 species in 13 families were
   collected. The factors which influenced significantly the species
   richness of different trophic levels (i.e. herbivors, predators) and
   degrees of food specialization (i.e. generalist and specialist
   herbivors) were concordant. Contrary to this, the factors which
   influenced the abundance of the different feeding groups varied
   strongly. We emphasise the vegetation and land use types as primarily
   influential factors for insects. Excluding the grass-feeding species,
   the number of both generalist, specialist herbivorous and predaceous
   species were lower in agricultural swards, i.e. hay-meadows and pastures
   than in old field and dike habitats and their number increased with
   increasing vegetation diversity. Due to the high species richness and
   abundance observed in dike and old field habitats compared to
   agricultural swards, we emphasise their importance for conservation of
   insect diversity and we stress the negative effects of agricultural
   intensification on the remaining grasslands of the lower reach of the

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Fire prevention management is becoming a necessity in many Mediterranean
   locations to regulate fire of natural or human origin. However, very few
   studies have determined the real effects of the strategies adopted on
   local fauna. Butterflies are sensitive to local changes and they can
   thus serve as indicators of environmental changes. Three different types
   of fire prevention management approaches in three different localities
   in the Eastern Pyrenees (France) were performed and the butterfly
   community composition was investigated. We show that of the 80 species
   of butterflies observed, 36 \% can be considered as biological markers.
   An original objective treatment of data using hierarchical distance
   analysis combined with a neural network analysis (Self-Organizing Maps)
   was applied in this study. Our conclusions are that the overall number
   of species is maintained independently of the fire prevention type but
   that some important changes are observed among butterfly communities,
   with a clear reduction of the numbers of endemic/specialized species in
   favour of generalist ones for the two most drastic fire prevention
   management approaches studied here. The influence of such approaches is
   discussed on the basis of the conservation of Mediterranean species of
   Lepidoptera.}},

Abstract = {{To predict the consequences of environmental change on the structure and
   composition of communities, it is necessary to also understand the
   regional drivers underlying the structuring of these communities. Here,
   we have taken a hypothesis-based approach to test the relative
   importance of niche versus neutral processes using niche overlap,
   species traits and population asynchrony in two crossed treatments of
   fertilization and grazing in an alpine meadow community. Our results
   suggested that the observed species biomass overlap was not
   significantly different between treatments of grazing, grazing x
   fertilization and grazer exclusion. In contrast, the species biomass
   overlap was higher than expected in fertilization treatments when
   grazers were excluded. On the one hand, we found no relationship between
   species traits and relative abundance in grazing, grazing x
   fertilization and grazer-exclusion treatments; on the other hand,
   mechanistic trait-based theory could be used to predict species relative
   abundance patterns in fertilization treatments when grazers were
   excluded. From grazing to fertilization, when grazers were excluded,
   there was a slight increase in species synchrony, which indicated that
   the complementary dynamic of species gradually changed from complete
   independence into synchronously fluctuating with increasing
   fertilization. Based on the above results, we concluded that stochastic
   and deterministic processes formed ends of a continuum from grazing to
   fertilization when grazers were excluded in an alpine meadow plant
   community, and the importance of niche differences between species in
   structuring grassland communities increased with increasing
   fertilization and decreased with grazing.}},

Title = {{A burning issue: Fire overrides grazing as a disturbance driver for
   South African grassland bird and arthropod assemblage structure and
   diversity}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we investigated the responses of two faunal groups, birds
   and arthropods, to varying degrees of disturbance caused by fire and
   grazing in South Africa, eight study sites of varying fire frequency and
   stocking density were studied over two summer seasons (October-March).
   Bird assemblages reflected habitat disturbance in a diversity of ways,
   driven by factors ranging from direct disturbance to changes in habitat
   structure and functioning, and shifts in food availability. Similarly,
   arthropod diversity and abundance changed seasonally in response to
   management practices. Fire frequency drives faunal assemblage structure
   and abundance and, in most cases, overrides the effects of grazing at
   all taxonomic levels. In particular, fire frequency strongly influenced
   grassland-breeding birds because farms are burnt in the
   territory-forming stage of the breeding cycle. Insectivores, and
   nectarivores were disproportionately impacted by intensive commercial
   management. Of particular concern in this system is the yellow-breasted
   pipit (Anthus chloris), which is regionally and globally Vulnerable
   because of habitat loss. This species is sensitive to any form of
   habitat disturbance, highlighting the need for conservation attention in
   these grasslands. Of the ten arthropod orders present in the study area,
   only Orthoptera responded positively to burning. However, orthopterans
   made up on average 78\% of arthropod biomass in moist highland
   grasslands, resulting in high grasshopper biomass on annually burnt
   farms: this high biomass in turn supports an abundance of insectivores.
   This reinforces the importance of process-oriented data where a measure
   of performance, such as reproductive Success, is considered in assessing
   ecosystem condition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A cutting management regime maintains high levels of biodiversity in

   Using formulae based upon Fischer Tropsch (FT) fuel process models, we

   represents 38\% of the Welsh transport sector's green house gas (GHG)

   that methane yields from anaerobic digestion of the feedstock could
   reduce GHG emissions by 11\% of the domestic sector's reduction target
   for 2020. Electricity generation from methane is also explored. The
   results presented encourage further investigation into the contribution

Title = {{Importance for forest plant communities of refuges protecting from deer
   browsing}},
Journal = {{FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{289}},
Pages = {{470-477}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{There is growing evidence that the increase of wild ungulates worldwide
   is responsible of strong deleterious impacts on various component of
   forest biodiversity (tree and shrub regeneration, insects, songbirds).
   Plant communities are particularly affected by overbrowsing, and
   overabundant deer are increasingly recognized as a major factor of
   decline in understory plant diversity in temperate and boreal forest
   ecosystems.
   In grassland ecosystems, refuges from herbivores have been shown to
   provide suitable habitat for plants sensitive to browsing and grazing,
   and to allow the conservation of rare plant species. In the present
   study we analyze if such refuges can maintain representative samples of
   forest plant communities exposed to strong browsing pressure by deer.
   For this we used the unique situation offered by the presence, side by
   side, on the Haida Gwaii archipelago of forested islands colonized or
   not by introduced deer.
   We compared plant assemblages on rocky outcrop to assemblages found in
   the adjacent field-layer in order (1) to assess, on islands without
   deer, the potential of refuges to be representative of the local
   field-layer communities and (2), on islands colonized by deer for over
   60 years, to analyze how far plant assemblages on rocky outcrops are
   representative of un-browsed field-layer communities and can serve as
   bioassays for field-layer plant communities in the absence of unbrowsed
   reference sites. We did this for forest-interior field-layer plant
   communities as well as for the forest edge plant communities found along
   the shorelines. We used refuges on treefall mounds to assess the role
   refuges can play as sources of propagules in two understory shrubs and
   ferns.
   Our results indicate that, in presence of deer, plant species density
   and plant cover are dramatically higher in refuges than in the adjacent
   field-layer plots. The comparison of these refuge communities to the
   reference state provided by the field-layer on islands without deer
   indicated that refuges maintain a representative part of the unbrowsed
   plant community, although with differences in the cover percentage in
   some plants. Some typical plants are more abundant in the refuges and,
   more sobering, six field-layer species are only poorly present in the
   rocky habitat. Despite these differences and their small size, refuges
   shelter a representative part of the understory and forest edge
   vegetation of the studied sites and could serve as a bioassay of deer
   overbrowsing in situations lacking a reference state. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Microbes play key roles in various biogeochemical processes, including
   carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. However, changes of microbial
   community at the functional gene level by livestock grazing, which is a
   global land-use activity, remain unclear. Here we use a functional gene
   array, GeoChip 4.0, to examine the effects of free livestock grazing on
   the microbial community at an experimental site of Tibet, a region known
   to be very sensitive to anthropogenic perturbation and global warming.
   Our results showed that grazing changed microbial community functional
   structure, in addition to aboveground vegetation and soil geochemical
   properties. Further statistical tests showed that microbial community
   functional structures were closely correlated with environmental
   variables, and variations in microbial community functional structures
   were mainly controlled by aboveground vegetation, soil C/N ratio, and
   NH4+-N. In-depth examination of N cycling genes showed that abundances
   of N mineralization and nitrification genes were increased at grazed
   sites, but denitrification and N-reduction genes were decreased,
   suggesting that functional potentials of relevant bioprocesses were
   changed. Meanwhile, abundances of genes involved in methane cycling, C
   fixation, and degradation were decreased, which might be caused by
   vegetation removal and hence decrease in litter accumulation at grazed
   sites. In contrast, abundances of virulence, stress, and antibiotics
   resistance genes were increased because of the presence of livestock. In
   conclusion, these results indicated that soil microbial community
   functional structure was very sensitive to the impact of livestock
   grazing and revealed microbial functional potentials in regulating soil
   N and C cycling, supporting the necessity to include microbial
   components in evaluating the consequence of land-use and/or climate
   changes.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional agro-pastoral practices are in decline over much of the
   Alps, resulting in the complete elimination of livestock grazing in some
   areas. Natural reforestation following pastoral abandonment may
   represent a significant threat to alpine biodiversity, especially that
   associated with open habitats. This study presents the first assessment
   of the potential effects of natural reforestation on dung beetles by
   exploring the relationships between the beetle community (abundance,
   diversity, species turnover and assemblage structure) and the vegetation
   stages of ecological succession following pastoral abandonment. A
   hierarchical sampling design was used in the montane belt of the Sessera
   Valley (north-western Italian Alps). Dung beetles were sampled across 16
   sampling sites set in four habitat types corresponding to four different
   successional stages (pasture, shrub, pioneer forest and beech forest) at
   two altitudinal levels. The two habitats at the extremes of the
   ecological succession, i.e. pasture and beech forest, had the greatest
   effect on the structure of local dung beetle assemblages. Overall, dung
   beetle abundance was greater in beech forest, whereas species richness,
   Shannon diversity and taxonomic diversity were significantly higher in
   pasture, hence suggesting this latter habitat can be considered as a key
   conservation habitat. Forests and pastures shared a lower number of
   species than the other pairs of habitats (i.e. species turnover between
   these two habitats was the highest). The two intermediate seral stages,
   i.e. shrub and pioneer forest, showed low dung beetle abundance and
   diversity values. Local dung beetle assemblages were also dependent on
   season and altitude; early-arriving species were typical of pastures of
   high elevation, whereas late-arriving species were typical of beech
   forests. It is likely that grazing in the Alps will continue to decrease
   in the future leading to replacement of open habitats by forest. This
   study suggests therefore that, at least in the montane belt,
   reforestation may have potentially profound and negative effects on dung
   beetle diversity. Maintaining traditional pastoral activities appears to
   be the most promising approach to preserve open habitats and adjacent
   beech forests, resulting in the conservation of species of both
   habitats.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamic equilibrium model of species diversity predicts that
   ecosystem productivity interacts with disturbance to determine how many
   species coexist. However, a robust test of this model requires
   manipulations of productivity and disturbance over a sufficient
   timescale to allow competitive exclusion, and such long-term
   experimental tests of this hypothesis are rare. Here we use long-term
   (27 years), large-scale (8 x 50-m plots), factorial manipulations of
   soil resource availability and sheep grazing intensity (disturbance) in
   grasslands to test the dynamic equilibrium model. As predicted by the
   model, increased productivity not only reduced plant species richness,
   but also moderated the effects of grazing intensity, shifting them from
   negative to neutral with increasing productivity. Reductions in species
   richness with productivity were associated with dominance by faster
   growing (i.e. high specific leaf area) and taller plants. Conversely,
   grazing favoured shorter plants and this effect became stronger with
   greater productivity, consistent with the view that grazing can lead to
   weaker asymmetric competition for light. Our study shows that the
   dynamic equilibrium model can help to explain changes in plant species
   richness following long-term increases in soil resource availability and
   grazing pressure, two fundamental drivers of change in grasslands
   worldwide.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the essential role of minerals in maintaining homeostasis in
   large herbivores, a dietary intake that avoids deficiency or excess is
   crucial to keeping animals healthy. However, mineral element
   concentrations are highly variable between and within plant species. We
   therefore hypothesized that the mineral balance in grazing cattle may be
   influenced by plant species abundance in pasture. We simulated mineral
   intakes using two different models (algorithms) for varying numbers of
   17 plant species characterized in a field survey of a temperate pasture
   in Japan. We calculated the mineral intakes from 1000 combinations of
   species for each species richness (number of species) for each of 12
   mineral elements. Both models indicated that the estimated intakes of
   Mg, K and Mn could exceed the maximum tolerable range, and those of P,
   Na, Fe and Cu could potentially fail to meet the minimum requirements.
   The mean proportion of estimated intakes that ranged between minimum
   requirement and maximum tolerable level was approximately 17\% higher
   for 17 species than for a single species. These results suggest that
   increasing the plant diversity in the pasture reduced the risk of
   mineral deficiencies or toxicities. Our results indicate that wild
   plants, normally regarded as weeds, should be maintained within improved
   pasture to maintain species diversity and assist with the mineral
   balance of animals grazed upon it. This work is an important precursor
   to future studies linking animal husbandry and ecological research. (C)

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{The seasonal dynamics of the molluscan fauna associated with the
   westernmost populations of the Mediterranean seagrass Posidonia
   oceanica, has been studied throughout an annual cycle in the
   northwestern coasts of the Alboran Sea. Samples were collected
   seasonally (5 replicated per season) using a non-destructive sampling
   technique (airlift sampler) on quadrats of 50 x 50 cm at 2 sites located
   7 km apart. Several environmental variables from the water column
   (temperature, chlorophyll a), the sediment (percentage of organic
   matter) and the seagrass meadows (shoot density, leaf height and width,
   number of leaves per shoot) were also measured in order to elucidate
   their relationships with the dynamics of the molluscan assemblages. In
   these meadows, a total of 17,416 individuals of molluscs were collected,
   belonging to 71 families and 171 species, being Rissoidae,
   Pyramidellidae and Trochidae the best-represented families, and
   Mytilidae, Nassaridae and Trochidae the dominant ones in terms of
   abundance. The assemblages were dominated by micro-algal grazers, filter
   feeders and ectoparasites (including those feeding on sessile preys).
   The species richness and the abundance displayed significant maximum
   values in summer, whereas evenness and diversity displayed maximum
   values in spring, being significant for the evenness. Both abundance and
   species richness values were positively correlated to seawater
   temperature and percentage organic matter, only for the latter, and
   negatively to leaf width. Significant seasonal groupings were obtained
   with multivariate analyses (MDS, Cluster, ANOSIM) using qualitative and
   quantitative data that could be mainly related to biological aspects
   (i.e. recruitment) of single species. The molluscan assemblages are
   influenced by the biogeographical location of the area (Alboran Sea),
   reflected in the absence or scarcity of most Mediterranean species
   strictly associated with P. oceanica (e.g. Tricolia speciosa, Rissoa
   ventricosa) and by the occurrence of subtropical fauna (e.g. Ungulina
   cuneata). The patchiness of the meadows, intercalated in other habitats
   like photophilous algae, and the strong hydrodynamism resulting from the
   unusually shallow setting, may promote the movement of species between
   these habitats and the seagrass and therefore enhance the species
   richness. This large faunistic list for the molluscan fauna associated
   with P. oceanica is therefore different than those observed in other
   meadows, and highlights the conservation value of these fragmented
   meadows located in their western distributional limit. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been a renewed interest in mountain farming, and
   several studies have been carried out on milk and cheese obtained in the
   unique environmental conditions of the Alps, a 1300 km mountain chain,
   located in the north of Italy. In this paper, the influence, on some
   cheese constituents, of two very similar mountain grasslands, both
   dominated by Festuca-Agrostis, was investigated. The two pastures were
   located in the same area in the southeastern Italian alpine region and
   differed in sunshine orientation and exposure. Milk obtained from cows
   grazing on these pastures was used to produce a semi-hard traditional
   cheese. The differences observed between the cheeses of the two areas
   for both some hydrocarbons (1-phytene and 2-phytene) and trans-fatty
   acids can be explained by a different rumen environment created by the
   botanical composition of the two pastures. The multidisciplinary
   approach can be considered a successful strategy, suitable for studying
   markers of authenticity.}},

Abstract = {{This study tested whether the endophyte-promoted competitive superiority
   of forage grass can be used in biological weed control. Feasibility of
   endophytes in weed control was tested by manipulating endophyte
   colonization of meadow fescue (Scherodonus pratensis ex. Lolium pretense
   and Festuca pratensis) in three experiments. First, species richness,
   the cover percentages and biomass of detected species were estimated in
   replicated field plots seeded with endophyte-free (E-) or endophyte
   colonized (E+) meadow fescue. Four years after establishment of the
   grass monocultures, weed species richness and coverage was higher in E-
   plots compared to E+ plots. The cover percentages of meadow fescue
   decreased with weed invasions being 75\% and 98\% in E- and E+ plots,
   respectively. Similarly, the proportion of weeds in the total biomass
   was over 45\% higher in E- plots compared to E+ plots at the end of the
   six years study. Half of the plots were subjected to herbivory by voles,
   but the effect of endophyte overrode the effect of herbivory. Second,
   the survival of individually grown E+ meadow fescues was higher and the
   plants were 50\% larger and produced 54\% more inflorescences than E-
   plants in a common garden experiment. Third, a seed germination test
   demonstrated that recruitment of new meadow fescues was not mediated by
   substances inhibiting seed germination potentially released by E+
   plants. These results demonstrated that endophyte promoted competitive
   superiority of grass cultivars can hinder weed invasions. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Scattered trees occurring throughout farmland matrix are prominent
   features of many human-dominated landscapes around the world, especially
   in livestock grazing systems. They are keystone structures that may play
   important roles in maintaining ecosystem functions, services, and
   farmland biodiversity. However, scattered trees in agricultural
   landscapes are declining worldwide due to intensive land use. They are
   often perceived by farmers as having negative impacts on agricultural
   production. Large-scale assessments in different biomes of agricultural
   yield in scattered tree ecosystems remain rare. Filling this knowledge
   gap may help improve decision-making regarding the value of scattered
   trees in agricultural landscapes. Using meta-analysis, we found that,
   across four tree functional groups (deciduous, Eucalyptus, N-2-fixing,
   evergreen oak), mature scattered trees do not compromise pasture yield.
   The sign and magnitude of scattered tree effects on pasture yield did
   vary, however, among tree functional groups and according to
   precipitation levels. Our study suggests that, as drought pressure
   increases abiotic stress, tree facilitation by N-2-fixing trees, and
   competition by Eucalyptus, will become the more common interactions
   between scattered trees and pasture. Management options exist to
   conserve and restore scattered trees in agricultural landscapes, but new
   policies are required to support their widespread adoption by farmers.

Abstract = {{Bumblebee communities and their foraging resources were surveyed in
   south Swedish agricultural landscapes of contrasting complexity, defined
   by the size of arable fields and the amount of permanent grazed
   pastures. After the flowering of oilseed rape (OSR), simplified
   landscapes contained substantially less herbaceous flower resources and
   a lower proportion of perennials, compared to complex ones. The seasonal
   pattern of bumblebee abundance differed between landscape types. Initial
   bumblebee abundances were equal in both landscape types. However, by
   late July there was a sharp decline of bumblebees in simple landscapes,
   while the abundance continued to increase in complex landscapes. This
   suggests that a larger proportion of bumblebee colonies may fail to
   reproduce in simple landscapes despite a beneficial early season.
   Overall, bumblebee abundance in late July was positively related to
   three inter-related variables: area of permanent pasture, area of ley
   fields and total amount of herbaceous flowers, while early abundances
   (June to early July) did not relate to these variables. We suggest that
   in simplified landscapes of this region, bumblebee abundance is limited
   by floral resources mainly from midsummer and onward. Spring and early
   summer resources may indeed be sufficient for colony establishment and
   initial growth even in simplified landscapes, possibly as a result of
   large scale farming of OSR. The initially equal abundances of workers in
   simple and complex landscapes, as well as the fact that also many of the
   regionally rare species seem to persist in simple landscapes, suggest
   that rare species can survive in pockets of beneficial habitat and/or
   there may be an inflow of queens from nearby complex landscapes. If the
   latter is true, further simplification or abandonment of complex
   landscapes may threaten bumblebee populations also in neighbouring
   simple landscapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The economic efficiency of conservation measures for amphibians in
   organic farming - Results from bio-economic modelling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Pages = {{404-413}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a whole farm bio-economic modelling approach for the
   assessment and optimisation of amphibian conservation conditions applied
   at the example of a large scale organic farm in North-Eastern Germany.
   The assessment focuses mainly on the habitat quality as affected by
   conservation measures such as through specific adapted crop production
   activities (CPA) and in-field buffer strips for the European tree frog
   (Hyla arborea), considering also interrelations with other amphibian
   species (i.e. common spadefoot toad (Pelobates fuscus), fire-bellied
   toad (Bombina bombina)). The aim of the approach is to understand,
   analyse and optimize the relationships between the ecological and
   economic performance of an organic farming system, based on the
   expectation that amphibians are differently impacted by different CPAs.
   The modelling system consists of a set of different sub-models that
   generate a farm model on the basis of environmentally evaluated CPAs. A
   crop-rotation sub-model provides a set of agronomically sustainable crop
   rotations that ensures overall sufficient nitrogen supply and controls
   weed, pest and disease infestations. An economic sub-model calculates
   the gross margins for each possible CPA including costs of inputs such
   as labour and machinery. The conservation effects of the CPAs are
   assessed with an ecological sub-model evaluates the potential negative
   or positive effect that each work step of a CPA has on amphibians. A
   mathematical programming sub-model calculates the optimal farm
   organization taking into account the limited factors of the farm (e.g.
   labour, land) as well as ecological improvements. In sequential model
   runs, the habitat quality is to be improved by the model, while the
   highest possible gross margin is still to be achieved.
   The results indicate that the model can be used to show the scope of
   action that a farmer has to improve habitat quality by reducing damage
   to amphibian population on its land during agricultural activities.
   Thereby, depending on the level of habitat quality that is aimed at,
   different measures may provide the most efficient solution. Lower levels
   of conservation can be achieved with low-cost adapted CPAs, such as an
   increased cutting height, reduced sowing density and grubbing instead of
   ploughing. Higher levels of conservation require e.g. grassland-like
   managed buffer strips around ponds in sensible areas, which incur much
   higher on-farm conservation costs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Ground beetles were sampled in nine crops and four field boundary types
   on a split conventional/organic farm in northern England in the five
   years 2005-2009. Multivariate analyses indicated that a combination of
   crop type, management and boundary type influenced ground beetle species
   and group activity. Short vegetation boundaries with bare ground had
   similar activity, mainly of small species, to that in organic arable
   crops, contrasting with activity in conventional arable and more densely
   vegetated boundaries. Large, medium-sized, herbivorous and Collembola
   feeding species all had considerable activity in oilseed rape and
   activity was generally greatest in conventional arable crops but least
   in conventional grass. Disturbance and productivity estimations provided
   basic insights into ground beetle activity. Most small and medium-sized
   species were found in areas with low productivity but high and low
   disturbance, respectively. Large and Collembola feeding species were
   most active in highly productive areas with medium and low disturbance
   whilst most herbivorous species preferred medium values of both drivers.
   In crops, species richness was greatest in organic beans and
   conventional oilseed rape and lowest in conventional grass. There were
   more species in short vegetation boundaries than in more densely
   vegetated field edges. There may be potential for the use of
   productivity and disturbance estimations in the provision of ecosystem
   services, especially in assessing the conditions required to optimise
   ground beetle activity for pest control. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{MIRES AND PEAT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{SI}},
Abstract = {{Despite the beneficial effects of reeds on abiotic environmental
   resources (by trapping sediments) their tendency to form
   near-monocultures with only a small number of accompanying species
   limits biodiversity at the landscape scale. This is a problem in some
   habitats such as coastal saltmarsh grasslands which have the potential
   to host a range of rare species. To understand the influence of
   differing grazing regimes, we investigated the distribution of reed
   stands and of competing saltmarsh grassland on a 28 ha coastal island in
   the southern Baltic Sea. The water is brackish, and since 1989 the
   vegetation has been grazed by changing varieties and ages of cattle.
   Some changes in the distribution of Phragmites stands and saltmarsh
   grassland resulted from differences in grazing intensity, but the age
   and variety of cattle had little effect. In 2010 grazing by water
   buffalo at moderate stocking density was introduced. Reed stands
   diminished and saltmarsh grassland increased. This management has the
   potential to balance the conservation needs of birds (reduced nest
   losses from trampling) against those of vegetation.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effects of forest fragmentation and management practices
   on carabid beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) assemblages in the Japanese
   red pine forests of Naju City, South Korea. A total of 2,058 carabid
   individuals, representing 15 species, were collected by pitfall trapping
   from May to September 2010 in three forest types: native forest
   (relatively undisturbed forest), managed forest (planted trees with
   clear-cutting of the herb layer), and forest patch (fragmented forest).
   We showed that the different forest types differed significantly in
   terms of their carabid assemblages. The managed forest had the most
   distinct assemblage, with a lower species richness and abundance than
   the other two forest types. Although forest fragmentation did not
   significantly affect the species richness of carabid beetle assemblages,
   the abundance of some carabid beetles (forest specialists and
   large-sized species) was significantly altered by forest fragmentation
   and intensive forest management. Sub-tree layer and herb cover were the
   strongest environmental variables determining the carabid assemblage
   composition. Forest fragmentation is an inevitable change in landscape
   structure, particularly in urbanized and pre-urban areas, and it
   constitutes a threat to biodiversity through landscape homogenization.
   Therefore, it is necessary to identify appropriate management practices,
   designed to minimize the damage caused by the loss and modification of
   natural habitats, together with maintenance and enhancement of the
   biodiversity in urban areas.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1020-1031}},
Abstract = {{Ecological studies often suggest that natural grasslands with high
   species diversity will grow more biomass and leach less nitrogen (N). If
   this diversity effect also applies to fertilised and irrigated pastures
   with controlled removal of herbage, it might be exploited to design
   pastures that can assist the dairy industry to maintain production while
   reducing N leaching losses. The purpose of this study was to test
   whether pasture mixtures with a high functional diversity in ryegrass
   traits will confer on the system higher water- and N-use efficiency. The
   hypothesis was tested using a process-based model in which pasture
   mixtures were created with varying levels of diversity in ryegrass
   traits likely to affect pasture growth. Those traits were: the winter-
   or summer-dominance of growth, the ability of the plant to intercept
   radiation at low pasture mass, and rooting depth. Pasture production,
   leaching and water- and N-use efficiency were simulated for management
   typical of a dairy pasture. We found that the performance of the diverse
   ryegrass-clover mixtures was more strongly associated with the
   performance of the individual components than with the diversity across
   the components. Diverse pasture mixtures may confer other benefits, e.g.
   pest or disease resistance and pasture persistence. The testing here was
   within a selection of ryegrasses, and the greater possible diversity
   across species may produce different effects. However, these results
   suggest that highly performing pastures under fertilised and irrigated
   grazed conditions are best constructed by selecting components that
   perform well individually than by deliberately introducing diversity
   between components.}},

Abstract = {{In order to clarify the interactive mechanism between grazing yak and
   alpine meadow on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, our study assessed seed
   density (by species) in the topsoil of alpine meadow with different
   grazing intensities in the Tianzhu area, north-eastern margins of the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and their rates of occurrence in yak dung. Seed
   density in the topsoil of the lightly grazed, moderately grazed, heavily
   grazed and extremely grazed alpine meadows in November, 2010 were 1 551,
   1 692, 2 660 and 1 830 grains m(-2), while in the same meadows in April,
   2011 densities were 1 530, 2404, 2 530 and 2 692 grains m(-2),
   respectively. In the cold season pasture, mean seed density in yak dung
   from November to April in the lightly grazed, moderately grazed, heavily
   grazed and extremely grazed sites were 121, 127, 187, and 120 grains
   kg(-1) of dry yak dung. The proportion of total seed numbers in yak dung
   to soil seed bank in lightly grazed, moderately grazed, heavily grazed
   and extremely grazed alpine meadow was 1.40, 2.62, 0.69, and 0.90\%. 12
   species out of the 47 were not found in topsoil but were found in yak
   dung, 10 species out of 45 were not found in yak dung but were found in
   the topsoil. Endozoochorous dispersal by yaks is therefore very
   important for soil seed bank and plant biodiversity and population
   dynamics in alpine meadows.}},

Abstract = {{Cattle slurry is frequently used fertilizer on grasslands, but little is
   known about its effect on plant species composition. The aim of this
   study was therefore to assess effect of different application rates of
   cattle slurry (S0 - 0, S1 - 60, S2 - 120, S3 - 180, S4 - 240 kg
   N/ha/year) on the plant species composition of three-cut grassland. The
   study was performed over 6 years on moderately moist upland
   Arrhenatherion grassland in the Czech Republic dominated by Alopecurus
   pratensis, Trisetum flavescens, and Poa spp. Species composition
   recorded in treatments with application of cattle slurry in rate up to
   120 kg N/ha/year was similar to the unfertilized control. During first
   three years, species richness was similar in all treatments and then
   decreased the most in S4 followed by S3 treatment. Cover of short forbs
   increased in S0 and decreased with an increase in slurry application
   rate which supported tall grasses. Application of cattle slurry up to
   120 kg N/ha/year can be considered as suitable compromise between
   maintenance of species rich grasslands and requirements of farmers for
   sufficient forage production.}},

Abstract = {{Bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypiifolia L.) is an invasive weed that
   poses economic and environmental problems in northern Australia.
   Competition between pasture and bellyache bush was examined in North
   Queensland using combinations of five pasture treatments (uncut
   (control); cut as low, medium, and high pasture; and no pasture) and
   four bellyache bush densities (0, 2, 6 and 12plantsm(-2)) in a buffel
   grass (Cenchrus ciliaris L.) dominated pasture. The pasture treatments
   were applied approximately once per year but no treatments were applied
   directly to the bellyache bush plants. Measurements of bellyache bush
   flowering, seed formation, and mortality were undertaken over a 9-year
   period, along with monitoring the pasture basal cover and plant species
   diversity. Maximum flowering rates of bellyache bush occurred after 9
   years (97\%) in plots containing no pasture, with the lowest rates of
   9\% in uncut control plots. Earliest flowering (322 days after planting)
   and seed formation (411 days) also occurred in plots with no pasture
   compared with all other pasture treatments (range 1314-1393 days for
   seed formation to occur). No seeds were produced in uncut plots. At the
   end of 9 years, mortality rates of bellyache bush plants initially
   planted averaged 73\% for treatments with some pasture compared with
   55\% under the no-pasture treatment. The percentage of herbaceous plant
   basal cover in uncut plots was increased 5-fold after 9 years, much
   greater than the average 2\% increase recorded across the low, medium,
   and high pasture treatments. The number of herbaceous species in uncut
   plots remained largely unchanged, whereas there was an average reduction
   of 46\% in the cut pasture treatments. Buffel grass remained the species
   with the greatest basal cover across all cut pasture treatments,
   followed by sabi grass (Urochloa mosambicensis (Hack.) Dandy) and then
   red Natal grass (Melinis repens (Willd.) Ziska). These results suggest
   that grazing strategies that maintain a healthy and competitive pasture
   layer may contribute to reducing the rate of spread of bellyache bush
   and complement traditional control techniques such as the use of
   herbicides.}},

Title = {{Grass height is the determinant of sheep grazing effects on small
   mammals in a savanna ecosystem}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{403-408}},
Abstract = {{Small mammals play an important role in many ecosystems; hence, the
   factors that influence their community structure are of interest.
   Ungulate grazing is one such factor, and this study focussed on the
   effect of sheep (Ovis aries) grazing in a savanna ecosystem on
   small-mammal community structure. In a landscape-scale assessment,
   small-mammal community structure was compared at three different levels
   of grazing on a sheep farm in the Sub-Escarpment Savanna of the Eastern
   Cape, South Africa. In total, 97 small-mammal individuals across seven
   species were trapped. Of these individuals, 81.4\% were trapped on the
   no-grazing control, whereas 15.5\% and 3.1\% were trapped on the medium-
   and high-grazing treatments, respectively. The results showed that the
   only significant differences in abundance, diversity, evenness, and
   richness of small mammals among grazing treatments were those mediated
   by the effect of grazing on grass height. It is proposed that the
   reduction in grass height associated with grazing is the primary
   mechanism by which sheep adversely affect small mammals in this
   ecosystem. This could be explained by the increased exposure of small
   mammals to predators after grazing of grass by sheep, and food
   competition between sheep and small mammals. The data also suggest that
   small mammals may persist in small and isolated patches of suitable
   habitat (long grass) within heavily grazed pastures subjected to
   rotational grazing. In the broader context of community ecology, this
   study sheds light on cryptic and dynamic interactions between two quite
   different grazing guilds. Experimental work of this kind may help to
   determine the role of introduced sheep in biodiversity loss of small
   mammals across the globe.}},

Title = {{Pastoralists' knowledge of plant palatability and grazing indicators in
   an arid region of South Australia}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{445-454}},
Abstract = {{Indicator species have been used for several decades as measures of
   ecosystem health. In arid Australian rangelands, which are dominated by
   commercial grazing enterprises reliant on native pastures, the
   development of efficacious indicators is particularly important to
   monitor production and biodiversity values. The high temporal and
   spatial climatic variability of arid rangelands means that developing
   broad indicators is difficult and resource intensive. However,
   pastoralists, who observe their pastures and the species favoured by
   stock under a range of conditions, can provide information on local
   indicators. This paper examines pastoralists' knowledge in terms of its
   value for natural resource management in rangelands, including their use
   of local indicators and understanding of palatability of selected plant
   species. A survey was mailed to all 51 occupants of pastoral properties
   in the Stony Plains region of South Australia. Pastoralists were asked
   what species they considered indicators of overgrazing, whether they
   would destock if they noted changes in these indicators, what they knew
   of the palatability of certain plant species, and the usefulness of
   cracking-clay areas (a key landscape feature in the region) for grazing.
   Views of respondents on indicator species and plant palatability mostly
   concurred with published reports on the preferences of livestock for
   these species. A wide range of indicators (all perennial plant species
   and no animal species) was listed by respondents, suggesting that
   indicators are highly location-specific, plant-focussed, and not viewed
   consistently among pastoralists. Respondents related specific
   information about cracking-clay areas on their leases, including the
   influence of the timing and amount of rainfall on pasture productivity,
   and the value of these areas for livestock. It can be difficult for
   natural resource management practitioners, who may not observe the
   landscape regularly, to evaluate land condition and prescribe
   appropriate land management strategies. It is argued that the
   participation of pastoralists in science and policy development is
   fundamental to achieving sustainable land management, providing
   opportunities for social learning within an adaptive management
   framework.}},

Title = {{What are the long-term effects of livestock grazing in steppic sandy
   grassland with high conservation value? Results from a 12-year field
   study}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{33}},
Pages = {{189-212}},
Abstract = {{To examine the necessity of livestock grazing for managing threatened
   sand vegetation so as to ensure and develop its nature-conservation
   value, we investigated a grazing system in a model nature reserve
   (German upper Rhine valley) characterized by threatened steppic sandy
   grassland (Allio-Stipetum vegetation complex: Habitats Directive Annex
   I, priority type 6240, additionally Koelerion glaucae: priority type
   6120). The area has been grazed by sheep and additionally by donkeys
   since late summer of the year 2000. We established ungrazed (Au) and
   grazed plots (Ag) in the Allio-Stipetum complex in a systematic
   grid-plot design before grazing impact started.
   We sampled phytosociological releves yearly in the Au/Ag plots for 12
   vegetation periods. Additionally, we sampled releves on former farmland
   adjacent to the Allio-Stipetum complex (systematic grid-plot design)
   over ten vegetation periods. These former fields (Fg) were integrated in
   the grazing system since the beginning of the study. A constancy table
   was produced for Au, Ag, Fg. To determine the portions of target species
   (Koelerio-Corynephoretea, Festuco-Brometea species) we calculated
   target-species ratios (proportion of target species in comparison with
   the total species number; qualitative or quantitative approach:
   TSRqual/quant ). We tested the effects of grazing, year and interactions
   on structural and phytodiversity characteristics of the releves by mixed
   linear models.
   The results of the long-term experiment confirmed significant beneficial
   effects of grazing on habitat-typical structure and phytodiversity: e.
   g. reduction of litter, support of species which are short in height (<
   20 cm), reduction of taller species (> 50 cm), support of the diversity
   of all plant species, of non-graminoid herbs and of target plant
   species, reduction of Calamagrostis epigejos, positive effects on
   TSRqual and TSRquant values.
   Similar developments, e.g. for phytodiversity and Calamagrostis epigejos
   cover, were observed on the former fields, but there are still seed
   limitations and high ruderal-plant dominances. In general TSRqual/quant
   show remarkable increases, but do not reach the values of the Ag plots.
   Concerning aims of nature conservation, the habitat-typical vegetation
   structure and phytodiversity of the Allio-Stipentum shows an excellent
   development as a consequence of the used grazing management. However,
   occasionally small populations of target species did not increase (e.g.
   Koeleria glauca). The former fields show a development towards valuable
   sandy grassland.}},

Title = {{Diversity patterns in transitional grassland areas in floodplain
   landscapes with different heterogeneity}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{33}},
Pages = {{347-369}},
Abstract = {{The complex topography of floodplains provides conditions for high
   diversity and density of transitional areas between different grassland
   plant communities. Nevertheless, transitions have been almost completely
   neglected in previous studies of diversity patterns in semi-natural
   floodplain grasslands.
   We analyzed alpha-, beta- and gamma-components of plant species
   diversity in transitional areas between neighbouring wet and dry
   grassland communities in two landscapes of the Gauja River floodplain
   (Latvia) differing in landscape heterogeneity created by land use
   history and current management type (grazing versus mowing). In total 9
   transition areas and their adjacent vegetation were sampled in 1 m wide
   and 8 to 28 m long belt transects gridded into 0.5 m x 1 m plots.
   Cluster analysis was used to analyze variation in species composition of
   transitional areas and adjacent vegetation. Indicator species analysis
   was used to determine species specific to transitional areas (ecotonal
   species).
   Transitional areas of the homogeneous site had a more distinct species
   composition (clear division in clusters by cluster analysis) and
   significantly lower beta-diversity than those of the heterogeneous site.
   alpha-Diversity was significantly higher in transitions than in wet
   grasslands and lower than in dry grasslands in both sites. Comparing the
   two sites, alpha-diversity was significantly higher in wet grasslands of
   the heterogeneous site, but no differences were found between
   transitions and dry grasslands in the two sites. Higher beta-diversity
   of transitional areas in the heterogeneous site could be attributed to a
   higher density of different habitats per unit area in combination with
   grazing. No species were restricted to transitions, and no differences
   were apparent in the number of generalist species (indifferent species
   sensu Ellenberg indicator values for edaphic factors) between
   transitions and adjacent grasslands. Nevertheless, the total number of
   generalist species was considerably higher in the investigated
   floodplain grasslands than usually reported for respective vegetation
   types in Latvia.
   It was concluded that transitions of neighboring floodplain grassland
   plant communities were more important in shaping beta-diversity compared
   to alpha- and gamma-diversity. Our results suggest that destroying
   transitional areas between dry and wet grasslands by leveling the ground
   or by abandonment of the management practices will decrease habitat
   heterogeneity and lead to less pronounced ecotonal processes in the
   whole riverine landscape. Thus further studies about the role of
   fine-scale transitional areas for biodiversity of floodplains are
   important for ecological restoration of floodplain grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-natural dry grasslands host some of the most valuable habitats in
   Europe, due to their biodiversity heritage. Nevertheless, a strong
   decline in their extension, due to the cessation of traditional
   management, has been observed in the last decades. The aim of the study
   was to assess plant community changes due to abandonment and the effect
   of spring grazing in sub-Mediterranean dry grasslands, focusing on the
   plant functional traits involved in this turnover.
   The study area is located in the central Apennines (Italy), where
   grasslands were grazed by sheep in late winter and spring until 1980 and
   are nowadays abandoned. Releves sampled (using the Braun-Blanquet
   method) in different years, namely in 1976-1980 (grazed pasture) and
   again in 2010 (abandoned pasture) were compared. Results indicated that
   abandonment leads to the increase of species richness. Traits and
   strategies indicator sets were: therophyte for the grazed pasture;
   geophytes, flower palatability, early flowering strategy, clonal ability
   and presence of storage organs for the abandoned ones. Traits related to
   low levels of stress (tolerance strategies) are heavily reduced in
   grazed systems, and thus the functional composition of plant community
   is mostly characterised by traits promoting avoidance strategies. In
   abandoned conditions a higher number of species can co-exist thanks to
   the micro-scale variation of soil features and niche diversification.
   The research findings also revealed grazing timing as a key factor for
   understanding changes of plant functional trait patterns and spring
   grazing as a threat for orchid species.}},

Pages = {{3-16}},
Abstract = {{Cattle production is part of people's cultures and is important for
   human nutrition and welfare. However, conventional cattle ranching is a
   source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Carbon sequestration in
   vegetation and soils can be enhanced and GHG emissions reduced with
   controlled grazing, appropriate pasture species, and the use of
   silvopastoral systems (SPS), which combine trees and shrubs with
   pastures. In addition, SPS contribute to climate change adaptation
   thanks to the ameliorating effects of trees on air temperatures that dry
   out pastures, as well as improving animal well-being and productivity.
   Several types of SPS are commonly found in the agricultural landscapes
   of Latin America. Intensive SPS (ISPS), where fodder banks are combined
   with woody species planted at high density, produce better yields than
   conventional ranching thanks to higher cattle density and better weight
   gain by the animals. Research in Colombia, Nicaragua and Costa Rica
   shows that SPS have more carbon in aboveground biomass and in soils than
   degraded pastures. In SPS, the timber or fruit trees, either planted or
   from natural forest regeneration, increases carbon stocks and
   sequestration rates. Native tree species can be used in SPS with good
   results in terms of productivity, soil restoration, carbon
   sequestration, and biodiversity conservation. The use of SPS contributes
   to carbon sequestration in trees and in soils, while establishing forest
   plantations and conserving secondary forests increase carbon
   sequestration and storage at the landscape level. SPS and especially
   ISPS can contribute to climate change mitigation because their net GHG
   emissions can be negative. In Latin America, successful ISPS are being
   scaled up to regional levels. Incentives such as Payments for
   Environmental Services along with technical assistance can stimulate the
   adoption of SPS, thus contributing to climate change mitigation while
   preserving rural livelihoods.}},

Abstract = {{Proper management of rangelands is based on ecological principles, and
   an understanding of ecological processes is a precondition of the right
   management. Composition and construction of each plant community are
   largely under the control and influence of edaphic factors, and these
   factors help to identify growing plants of their own region.
   Determination of the scientific relationship between soil factors and
   vegetation in each region and its expansion to other similar regions
   will be important achievements in the management of rangelands. The aim
   of the study was to compare the physical and chemical properties of soil
   in the two communities of shrub land and grassland. For this purpose,
   two sites of grassland and shrub land were selected in the rangeland of
   Vavsar Kiasar. Vavsar is located in longitude 45 43 53 degrees-35 37 53
   degrees and in latitude 13 10 36 degrees-40 5 36 degrees. Climate was
   semi-arid to semi-humid and Mediterranean, using the Domartin method.
   Dominant plant species in the shrub land were Artemisia aucheri,
   Astragalus caspicus, Acantholimon bodeamun, and Stachys infelata, and
   species Festuca ovina, Stachys inflata,Noea mucronata, and Ephorbia
   cheiradenia were dominant in grassland. Sixty soil samples from each
   site were taken from two depths, 0-15 and 15-30 cm. In the laboratory,
   soil properties including organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN),
   electrical conductivity (EC), calcium carbonate (CaCO3) percentage,
   moisture content, and percentages of clay, silt, and sand were measured.
   The comparison of mean soil properties was performed between the two
   communities and two depths by using the T-test. The results showed that
   there was a significant difference in the level of 5\% among electrical
   conductivity, moisture content, and clay percentages at two depths of
   soil in the shrub-land site but there were no significant differences in
   soil factors between the two depths in the grassland site. There was a
   significant difference in the first depth of soil between shrub-land and
   grassland communities according to percentages of sand and silt,
   electrical conductivity, and CaCO3 and organic-matter percentages and in
   the second depth between the two communities for electrical
   conductivity, CaCO3 percentage, and clay percentage. In conclusion, soil
   condition in the shrub land was more desirable than in grassland because
   there was a greater percentage of vegetation and grazing intensity was
   less.}},

   Lower Saxony, Germany}},
Journal = {{FLORA}},

Volume = {{208}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing concern that land use intensification is having
   negative effects on semi-natural grasslands and that it leads to a
   general loss of biodiversity among all types of formerly extensively
   managed grasslands of poor to medium nutrient richness. Since the 1950s,
   many Central European uplands have been subject to an increase in
   grassland cover as a result of changes in land use practices. Using such
   a landscape in Lower Saxony, Germany, as a model region, we assessed
   environmental factors that control grassland diversity, including plant
   community composition, species richness and pollination trait
   composition. In 2007, 189 vegetation sampling sites were randomly
   distributed among grasslands covering some 394 ha within a 2500 ha study
   area. Plant communities were classified using TWINSPAN and the effects
   of environmental factors (soil, topography, current management and
   habitat continuity) were analysed by canonical correspondence analysis
   and regression analysis reducing for the effects of spatial
   autocorrelation by using principal coordinates of neighbour matrices.
   We found a wide range of six species-poor (<15 plant spp.) to extremely
   species-rich (>27 spp.) grassland types under mesic to dry site
   conditions, including sown, Cynosurion,Arrhenatherion and semi-natural
   grasslands. Grassland community composition was best explained by soil
   factors and species richness and pollination type composition by
   combined effects of current management and habitat continuity. During
   the 1950/60s, the extent of grassland area within the studied landscape
   rapidly increased to more than double its previous extent, and in 2007,
   grasslands comprised 16\%. Natura 2000 grassland types comprised 1\% of
   the surveyed site and medium-rich, high-nature-value grasslands a
   further 5\%. While the number of wind-pollinated plant species was equal
   among all grassland types, there was a parallel decline in
   insect-pollinated plants and overall median species richness in the
   grassland communities along a gradient of increasing land use intensity
   (mowing, nutrient supply). Moreover, insect-pollinated plants occurring
   in intensively managed grasslands were found to additionally have the
   ability for self-pollination. Species-rich grasslands - including
   semi-natural grasslands and a semi-improved, species-rich Arrhenatherion
   community - occurred exclusively on old sites (with >100 years of
   habitat continuity) that had been used for traditional sheep grazing
   (environmental contracting). Medium-rich Arrhenatherion grasslands were
   established primarily on less productive, formerly arable fields (<30
   years). We conclude that conservation efforts should focus on extant
   species-rich grassland types and should aim to implement traditional
   land use practices such as sheep grazing. Additional restoration efforts
   should focus on establishing new grasslands on less productive sites in
   the proximate surroundings of species-rich grasslands to facilitate seed
   dispersal, but nitrogen deposition should be buffered where appropriate.
   These measures would enhance the interaction between nature reserves and
   agricultural grasslands and thus improve the ecological quality of
   grasslands at the landscape scale. (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},

Pages = {{299-314}},
Abstract = {{In Australia, since the late 1990s the issue of vegetation `thickening'
   has become controversial. The semi-arid mulga lands of eastern Australia
   typify the debate. One view held by landholders, and some researchers,
   is that woody vegetation thickening is, at least partially,
   anthropogenic and leads to productivity loss and biodiversity decline.
   An alternative argument is that a narrative of vegetation thickening is
   unsubstantiated and is used by some landholders to justify management
   practices of clearing, thinning or burning. Absent in the literature has
   been research into the local knowledge of those who obtain their
   livelihoods from the region. This study presents an analysis of
   landholder responses to a survey about vegetation change in the mulga
   lands of south-west Queensland. Local knowledge is dominated by a view
   that woody vegetation thickening has occurred and is ongoing, and that
   it is driven by three interacting factors: (1) climate, especially
   decadal and multi-decadal extreme variations of both very wet and very
   dry conditions; (2) fire, particularly the absence of fire; and (3)
   total grazing pressure, including domestic stock and harder to control
   feral and native herbivores. Decline in pasture quality and quantity is
   also noted as an outcome of those same three factors but that it is
   ultimately linked to greater competition between the increased densities
   of woody species and the herbaceous layer. Most of the respondents to
   this survey had three or more generations of accumulated knowledge in
   the region. The value of local knowledge in land management and policy,
   although considered of value in many contexts, has received relatively
   little formal attention in vegetation management. In summary, the
   landholders view the dense woody component of the vegetation as an
   unnatural and undesirable `artificial wilderness', which those from
   outside the region may consider natural and therefore worthy of
   preservation in its current state.}},

Abstract = {{Woodlots ranging in area from 0.18 to 0.5 ha were established within the
   Cicerone Project farmlet trial on the Northern Tablelands of New South
   Wales, Australia, due to a lack of physical protection in most paddocks
   across the farmlets. Two percent of each farmlet was planted to trees to
   examine the commercial and environmental potential of seven species to
   provide shade and shelter for livestock, increase biodiversity or
   contribute to cash flow through farm forestry diversification.
   Eucalyptus caliginosa (timber), E. nitens (timber, pulp wood), E.
   radiata (essential oil) and Pinus radiata (timber) were planted in four
   upslope plots (1059-1062 m a.s.l.) in different paddocks. Casuarina
   cunninghamiana (timber, shelter), E. acaciiformis (shade, shelter and
   biodiversity), E. dalrympleana (timber, biodiversity), E. nitens
   (timber, pulp wood), E. radiata (essential oil) and P. radiata (timber)
   were planted in four low-lying plots (1046-1050 m a.s.l.) in separate
   paddocks, 400-1200 m distant. The pines and natives were planted in
   August and October 2003, respectively, into a well prepared, weed-free,
   mounded, planting bed. After 5 years, P. radiata (98\% survival) and E.
   nitens (83\%) survived best in upslope plots, reaching maximum heights
   of 7.8 and 8.8 m and exhibiting no or only modest insect damage,
   respectively. In low-lying plots, E. acaciiformis (75\% survival) and E.
   dalrympleana (80\%) survived best, reaching maximum heights of 5.5 and
   4.5 m, and exhibiting little or only moderate insect damage,
   respectively. P. radiata exhibited 17-69\% survival in the two
   lowest-lying plots but 100\% survival in the other two lowland plots. On
   average, <50\% of C. cunninghamiana, E. nitens and E. radiata survived
   in low-lying plots and survivors grew poorly. Early frosts in March 2004
   were the primary cause of losses in low-lying plots, and frost,
   waterlogging, insect attack and some inadvertent livestock browsing
   explain the slower growth of species in low-lying plots compared with
   their performance upslope. P. radiata and perhaps E. nitens have
   commercial promise for timber production on Northern Tablelands farms,
   but only in higher (well drained, less frost-prone) parts of the
   landscape. E. acaciiformis can withstand the stressful growing
   conditions in open pasture in low-lying plots, and should be planted
   more widely for on-farm shade and shelter. E. dalrympleana can also be
   considered for amenity and biodiversity plantings in lower parts of the
   landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding composition, structure and spatial heterogeneity in soil
   seed banks is important for the management of grassland ecosystem.
   Although the effect of fencing and grazing on vegetation composition is
   widely known, information on species composition, seed density and
   spatial heterogeneity of soil seed banks in sandy grasslands under
   fencing and grazing is still lacking. We measured the species
   composition and seed density of soil seed banks in fenced grassland,
   grazed grassland and grazed shrubby grassland in Horqin Sand Land,
   Northern China. By applying the geostatistical methods, we assessed how
   fencing and grazing affected spatial heterogeneity of soil seed banks in
   sandy grasslands. Total seed density and species richness in soil seed
   banks were lower in fenced grassland than in either grazed grassland or
   grazed shrubby grassland. Seed density and species richness of annual
   species in soil seed banks were also lower in fenced grassland than in
   either grazed grassland or grazed shrubby grassland, while those of
   perennial species showed a reverse trend. The analysis of spatial
   autocorrelation ranges, fractal dimensions and distribution pattern maps
   from geostatistical methods showed that spatial heterogeneity of seed
   density and species richness in soil seed banks were also lower in
   fenced grassland than in either grazed grassland or grazed shrubby
   grassland. Continuous fencing increases the seed density and species
   richness of perennial species in soil seed banks, as well as results in
   a decrease in spatial heterogeneity of seed density and species richness
   in soil seed banks. So, continuous fencing should be considered to
   restore the degraded sandy grasslands in management of semiarid
   grassland ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Shrub development on road outside verges can provide alternative
   wildlife habitat. However, management of inside verges should keep
   vegetation at a height consistent with proper road visibility and safety
   The influence of management on vegetation was analyzed on the inside
   verge of two Portuguese roads, one mown once and another twice a year.
   Specifically, the effect of mowing frequency on shrub abundance and the
   combined effect of management and shrubs on floristic diversity were
   addressed. One stretch of each road was surveyed for shrub abundance and
   for herbaceous species diversity and cover. The effect of mowing
   frequency on shrub growing and biomass production and allocation was
   also evaluated along two years. Results indicate that vegetation mowing
   yearly in spring is enough to keep the inside verge free from most
   shrubs. However, summer growing shrubs like Dittrichia viscosa can
   persist, decreasing both floristic diversity and cover, particularly of
   meadow species. Moreover, in response to spring mowing, shrubs grew fast
   and were able to disperse efficiently. An additional autumn mowing
   significantly decreased not only shrub height and canopy area, but
   specially seed production and dispersal. Thus, the inside verge
   management should be based on two mowing periods. The first in spring to
   control winter and spring growing species, and an additional autumn
   mowing to control growth and dispersal of summer growing shrubs and
   trees, or even tall grasses. This management regime will combine safety
   with improvement of the amenity and habitat value of the road verges.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding relationships between large herbivores and plant species
   diversity in dynamic riparian zones is critical to biodiversity
   conservation. The Nkuhlu exclosures in the Kruger National Park (KNP)
   provided opportunity to investigate spatial heterogeneity patterns
   within riparian zones, as well as how these patterns are affected by
   fire and herbivory. A monitoring project was initiated to answer
   questions about the dynamics of the herbaceous layer and was aimed at
   determining, (1) whether there exists meaningful variance in herbaceous
   plant species richness and diversity across different treatments in the
   ecologically sensitive sodic zone and (2) whether an increase in
   herbaceous biomass, an artefact of herbivory and fire exclusion,
   suppresses herbaceous plant species diversity and richness. Herbaceous
   vegetation was sampled in two 1 m(2) circular sub-plots in the eastern
   and western corners of 81 fixed plots. The biomass of each plot was
   estimated with a disc pasture meter (DPM) diagonally with the plot.
   DPM-readings were converted to kg/ha, according to the latest
   conversions for the Lowveld Savanna. Species richness and biomass showed
   significant variance across treatments, whereas no significant variation
   in herbaceous species diversity was perceived. Combined treatment of
   fire absence and herbivore presence contributed to higher forb species
   richness in the sodic zone. Biomass is significantly higher in fully
   fenced areas where herbivores are excluded, as opposed to the open and
   partially fenced areas. Although no significant variation was recorded
   for diversity across treatments, lowest diversity was recorded in the
   absence of all herbivores, especially in combination with fire
   treatment. Therefore herbivores are essential in sustaining herbaceous
   plant species richness in the sodic zone, whilst no significant results
   were found with regard to their effect on species diversity. Although
   statistically non-significant, fire seems to suppress species richness.
   Conservation implications: This study could be used as framework to
   advance and develop science-based management strategies for, at least,
   the sodic zones of the KNP. Research in these exclosures will create
   better understanding of these landscapes, benefit ecosystem conservation
   planning of national parks and also provide valuable long-term
   information on key ecological processes.}},

Abstract = {{Management of livestock grazing in highly-productive mountain meadows is
   an important aspect for the economic viability and the environmental
   impact of a grassland-based farm. The main aim of this study was to
   build near infrared models to determine the chemical composition and in
   vitro organic matter digestibility of Romanian meadow forages. The
   treatments were organic and mineral fertilizer combinations, and forage
   samples were obtained from three fertilization experiments conducted in
   the Apuseni Mountains; these samples were analysed using classical and
   NIR methods. The samples were scanned in the NIR wavelength band. The
   CRA-W Gembloux `local' calibration models were validated with Romanian
   meadow forages and then used in order to predict the forage quality of
   samples. A second objective of the study was to determine the effects of
   fertilization on forage quality. The results showed a decrease in crude
   protein content from the NPK treatment (150:75:75), which can be
   explained by a reduction of Fabaceae plants with this treatment from
   17.25\% of the populations in the control (semi-natural meadow not
   fertilized) to 6.25\% in the fertilized plots. The decrease in protein
   content and in vitro organic matter digestibility was related to a
   reduced Fabaceae presence. Our recommendation is to Use mineral
   fertilization with NPK doses less than 100:50.50 to improve meadow
   productivity; meanwhile organic fertilization can also be used to
   complement and maintain biodiversity and forage quality.}},

Abstract = {{Fire and grazing have long been used as a grassland management tool in
   South Africa for livestock production. Despite the ecological importance
   of fire and grazing to the grassland ecosystem, the appropriate use of
   fire and grazing as a land use management tool has been questioned. The
   effects of different burning frequencies and stocking rates on species
   composition were studied between January and March 2008 using a
   Modified-Whittaker design in commercial farms, communal land and a
   nature reserve stocked with game herbivores in the highland grassland of
   Mpumalanga Province of South Africa. The results revealed that species
   assemblages of an annually burned site were completely dissimilar from a
   biennially burned site. The annually burned site was dominated by flora
   that is considered as fire-tolerant species. In contrast, the protection
   of some areas from burning in addition to regular burning of other areas
   ensured the presence of both fire-tolerant and fire-intolerant species
   and contributed to the high species composition of communal land. This
   study therefore suggests that biennial burning, or even longer intervals
   of burning of grazed land in addition to partial or mosaic burning
   should be employed to enhance the biodiversity conservation status of
   these montane grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{1. The loss of farmland biodiversity threatens the sustainability of
   ecosystem services delivered within agricultural landscapes. The
   functional trait approach has been successfully used in grassland
   systems to quantify trade-offs and synergies between services delivered
   directly by plant communities. Many of the services delivered by arable
   landscapes, however, depend on invertebrate consumers, and the
   application of the trait-based approach to these systems depends on
   quantifying functional relationships between trophic levels.
   2. Two data sets of plant and invertebrate communities from a range of
   annual crops and uncropped land habitats were analysed. The
   community-weighted means of plant functional traits were calculated for
   the vegetation samples and used as the explanatory variables in a
   multivariate analysis of plant species composition across habitats. The
   constrained axes scores were used in statistical models to explain the
   variance in associated total invertebrate abundance, phytophagous
   invertebrates and invertebrate numbers weighted by importance in the
   diet of farmland bird chicks.
   3. The multivariate analysis discriminated between plant communities
   characterized by ruderal traits (high specific leaf area and early
   flowering) and those with more competitive traits. More ruderal
   communities also supported proportionally more invertebrates. The suite
   of traits included in the analysis explained a greater proportion of the
   variance in invertebrate abundance between uncropped habitats, as
   opposed to between annual crops.
   4. The overlap between the plant traits that respond to disturbance
   (functional response traits) and those that affect the abundance of
   phytophagous invertebrates (functional effect traits) and the diet of
   farmland birds demonstrates the potential for using common functional
   metrics to integrate the assessment of an ecosystem service across
   different habitats particularly on uncropped land where intensity of
   disturbance is the main environmental driver.
   5. Synthesis. The quantification of functional linkages between arable
   plants and the abundance of their associated invertebrate consumer
   communities is the first step in extending the trait-based approach to
   quantify trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services developed
   in grassland systems to landscapes dominated by arable crops. However,
   applying the functional approach to in-crop weed communities and other
   service providers such as pollinators will require the incorporation of
   additional response and effect traits.}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Trait-based approaches can provide a useful tool for linking plant
   attributes to community structure and ecosystem function. Seed mass and
   plant height play important roles in the dynamics of plant communities,
   but few empirical community level studies have tested this, especially
   in stressful environments. The aim of the present study was to determine
   if there is a relationship between functional traits (seed mass and
   plant height) and changes in species relative abundance (SRA) in
   response to grazing and fertilization. We measured SRA and plant
   functional traits for 40 common species in a Tibetan Plateau alpine
   meadow. In the fertilized meadow, seed mass and plant height was
   significantly positively correlated with the relative abundance of the
   species. In the grazed meadow, these variables were significantly
   negatively correlated. Our results demonstrates that plant functional
   traits can be used to predict the change of SRA in plant community.
   Grazing promotes the dominance of small-seeded and short-stature
   species, and fertilization facilitates the occurrence of large-seeded
   and tall-stature species.}},

Title = {{Disturbance intensity, timing and history interact to affect pasture
   weed invasion}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{44-53}},
Abstract = {{Past disturbance events shape future community trajectories if their
   ecological legacies interact with contemporary disturbance regimes to
   affect recruitment and reproduction. In pastures, large-scale
   disturbance events can become undetectable in aboveground community
   components but persist as augmented weed seedbanks, suggesting
   disturbance history may be a predictor of weed invasion magnitude
   following subsequent disturbance. Using a randomized block factorial
   design, we investigated how soil disturbance intensity, timing and
   history interact to affect weed recruitment, diversity and reproduction
   by implementing a range of disturbance intensities in April and June
   2004 in pastures of differing disturbance history. Response variables
   were followed for two years. Disturbance timing interacted with
   disturbance intensity and history to affect recruitment, with some June
   treatment combinations having >= 48\% higher weed abundance than those
   in April. Relative to undisturbed controls, low to intermediate
   disturbance intensity facilitated recruitment by >= 117\% but high
   intensity disturbance had highest recruitment, particularly in
   previously disturbed pastures (>= 543\% increase). In both years, weed
   species richness was highest in intense disturbances in previously
   disturbed pastures. Importantly, weed reproduction was nearly one order
   of magnitude higher in intense disturbance patches, especially in
   previously disturbed pastures, and increased through time by >= 243\%.
   These findings indicate weed recruitment, diversity and reproductive
   output are seed- and microsite-limited, and that intense soil
   disturbance may result in high long-term weed abundance. Although
   moderate disturbance facilitated recruitment, reproduction here was low,
   suggesting modest disturbance will not appreciably increase weed
   abundance. The most common species were Taraxacum officinale and Poa
   pratensis, both of which can benefit forage-livestock production, but
   most establishing species were of low palatability. We recommend
   grassland managers explicitly integrate disturbance history into dynamic
   management planning, consider augmenting seedbanks with `desirable' weed
   species to help communities recover following inevitable disturbance
   events and do not rely exclusively on aboveground characters to evaluate
   their system's vulnerability to undesirable plant establishment and
   persistence.}},

   largely indirect with respect to changes in resources, species

   We summarize hypotheses describing species diversity at local and

Abstract = {{Gaur, which became locally extinct before 1995 in Bandhavgarh Tiger
   Reserve (BTR), Central India, is an endangered animal per Schedule - I
   of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act (1972). A re-introduction program
   was therefore created to rebuild the gaur population in BTR, both to
   enhance the long-term survival of the species and to restore natural
   biodiversity. After re-introduction, the home range, habitat use and
   food habits of gaur (Bos gaurus gaurus) were studied in BTR, India, from
   January 2011 to January 2012. Nineteen gaurs (five males - three
   radio-collared and 14 females - nine radio-collared) were re-introduced
   from Kanha Tiger Reserve to Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve in January 2011.
   The reintroduced gaurs were monitored periodically through ground
   tracking and satellite GPS fixes. The mean annual group size of gaur was
   estimated at 7.3 +/- 0.76 (SE). The overall estimated summer, monsoon
   and winter home ranges of gaur were 290 km(2), 137 km(2) and 155 km(2)
   (Minimum Convex Polygon) respectively. The overall individual male home
   ranges varied from 135 to 142 km(2), and overall individual female home
   ranges varied from 32 to 169 km(2). Radio collared locations were
   plotted on a classified (LISS III) habitat map of Bandhavgarh Tiger
   Reserve to evaluate the habitat use and availability in each season.
   Habitat preference was computed using Bonferroni confidence interval
   method, compositional analysis and Ivlev's index. In summer, gaur
   largely preferred grassland (P<0.0001), whereas in monsoon and winter,
   gaur preferred bamboo mixed forest (P<0.0001). Gaur avoided open mixed
   forest (P<0.0001) and agricultural land in all three seasons. Data on
   food habits were collected through opportunistic sightings. In total,
   gaur fed on 68 plant species. The present study has reported first-time
   information on ranging patterns of reintroduced gaur and their degree of
   preferences for different vegetation and terrain types across seasons,
   which will be very useful to the park administration for future
   conservation of this endangered species and for habitat intervention.}},

Abstract = {{The occurrence of interstitial species in Astrebla grasslands in
   Australia are influenced by grazing and seasonal rainfall but the
   interactions of these two influences are complex. This paper describes
   three studies aimed at determining and explaining the changes in plant
   species richness and abundance of the interstitial species in a
   long-term sheep utilisation experiment in an Astrebla grassland in
   northern Queensland. In the first study, increasing utilisation
   increased the frequency of Dactyloctenium radulans (Button grass) and
   Brachyachne convergens (Downs couch) and reduced that of Streptoglossa
   adscendens (Mint bush). In the second study, seasonal rainfall variation
   between 1984 and 2009 resulted in large annual differences in the size
   of the seed banks of many species, but increasing utilisation
   consistently reduced the seed bank of species such as Astrebla spp. and
   S. adscendens and increased that of species such as B. convergens, D.
   radulans, Amaranthus mitchellii (Boggabri) and Boerhavia sp. (Tar vine).
   In the third study, the highest species richness occurred at the
   lightest utilisation because of the presence of a range of palatable
   forbs, especially legumes. Species richness was reduced as utilisation
   increased. Species richness in the grazing exclosure was low and similar
   to that at the heaviest utilisation where there was a reduction in the
   presence of palatable forb species. The pattern of highest species
   richness at the lightest grazing treatment was maintained across three
   sampling times, even with different amounts of seasonal rainfall, but
   there was a large yearly variation in both the density and frequency of
   many species. It was concluded that the maintenance of highest species
   richness at the lightest utilisation was not aligned with other data
   from this grazing experiment which indicated that the maximum
   sustainable wool production occurred at moderate utilisation.}},

Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{29-36}},
Abstract = {{Enclosures are widely used by pastoralists in East Africa. However, the
   response of herbaceous and woody vegetation to enclosures seasonally
   grazed by livestock remains poorly understood. This study investigated
   the effectiveness of traditional enclosures in improving herbaceous and
   woody vegetation in the Somali Regional State of eastern Ethiopia.
   Vegetation composition (species composition, diversity and richness) and
   structure (herbage mass, density and canopy cover) were measured inside
   and outside a set of enclosures. The enclosures contained higher numbers
   of desirable species than the adjacent open-access grazing areas. Woody
   species richness was higher in the open-access grazing areas than in the
   enclosures, which is attributed to the manual removal of most of the
   undesirable shrubs and trees in the enclosures by pastoralists. Herbage
   mass was 2642 and 843 kg of dry matter ha(-1) in the enclosures and
   open-access communal grazing areas, respectively. Herbaceous species
   diversity was higher in the enclosures than in the open-access communal
   grazing areas (Shannon-Wiener index: 1.8 v. 1.4, respectively). The
   enclosures were richer in herb species than the open-access grazing
   areas (13.5 v. 6.8, respectively), but values for woody species were not

Title = {{Use of mineral mix supplements to modify the grazing patterns by cattle
   for the restoration of sub-alpine and alpine shrub-encroached grasslands}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{85-93}},
Abstract = {{Throughout the last decades, agricultural abandonment in European
   mountain areas has caused changes in traditional livestock management
   with consequences for semi-natural grassland use and vegetation. In the
   Western Italian Alps, continuous extensive grazing has become the
   simplest and the most common system for managing large cattle herds. As
   a result, limited grazing in many rugged locations has led to an
   extensive shrub-encroachment of semi-natural grasslands in the
   sub-alpine and alpine belts. A study was conducted to assess if the
   provision of mineral mix supplements (MMS): (1) increases the use of
   steep and shrub-encroached locations by beef cows, and (2) helps restore
   meso-eutrophic grassland vegetation around supplement-deployment sites.
   During the summer grazing season, MMS were placed within 10 steep and
   shrub-encroached areas in two adjacent pastures (364 and 366 ha), and 12
   cows were tracked with GPS collars. For each supplement site, a paired
   control site was identified, and vegetation surveys were performed in
   the surrounding areas of both sites. Placement of MMS increased the use
   of areas within 12 m of supplement locations compared with corresponding
   control areas. Cattle use of areas within 100 m of the MMS sites was
   also greater than expected by chance. The use by cattle, associated with
   trampling, grazing and faecal deposition, reduced the cover of shrubs
   and oligotrophic herbaceous species and increased the average nutrient
   N-value and forage pastoral value of the new vegetation types
   established around MMS sites 2 years after their use by cattle.
   Strategic placement of MMS appears to be a sustainable practice to
   restore sub-alpine and alpine shrub-encroached grasslands. Nevertheless
   these results must be considered preliminary as a longer period is
   needed to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of this practice for the
   restoration of semi-natural grasslands.}},

Title = {{Manipulating livestock grazing to enhance native plant diversity and

Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-108}},
Abstract = {{Temperate perennial grasslands globally have been subject to extensive
   biodiversity loss. Identifying livestock grazing regimes that maintain
   and enhance the diversity and cover of native plant species in these
   ecosystems remains a key challenge. The responses of vegetation to
   different sheep grazing regimes were assessed over 3 years in grasslands
   of southeastern Australia. An open communal experimental design was used
   to assess the effects of varying season and duration of exclusion of
   grazing by sheep, replicated at three locations. Manipulation of season
   and duration of exclusion of grazing led to few major changes in the
   cover of native perennial grasses or forbs, although seasonal variation
   was considerable. Exclusion of grazing in the spring did increase the
   likelihood of occurrence of grazing-sensitive native forb species but
   also lead to an increase in the cover of exotic annual species. However,
   cover of exotic annual species tended to decline with increasing
   duration of exclusion, while the abundance of native, grazing-sensitive
   forbs and the cover of perennial grasses increased. Small-scale richness
   of native perennial forb species increased with a 3-month period of
   exclusion of grazing, but declined with year-round exclusion of sheep.
   Total species richness also declined in response to year-round exclusion
   of sheep and rates of decline were correlated with the rate at which
   herbage mass accumulated. While strategic grazing did not result in
   major vegetation changes in the short term, it is suggested that some
   grazing exclusion may enhance the survival of infrequent species most
   sensitive to sheep grazing. Caution, however, should be taken when
   grazing regimes implemented benefit both desirable (native forbs) and
   undesirable (exotic annuals) species. Having a mosaic of flexible
   grazing management regimes across the landscape is likely to be
   beneficial for native plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of four herbicides
   for controlling invasive Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) and tall
   fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) in idle grasslands by monitoring
   post-treatment plant communities. Experiments were conducted in two
   remnant savannas in central Kentucky. With the exception of domestic
   grazing, these sites were chosen because they were undisturbed by
   agriculture and development. Single treatments of 0.2 kg ai/ha imazapic,
   0.2 kg ai/ha clethodim, 0.2 kg ai/ha imazapic + 1.1 kg al/ha glyphosate,
   0.03 kg ai/ha sulfosulfuron, and an untreated control were implemented
   in fall 2004 and spring and summer 2005 at each site in a randomized
   complete block design. Plant communities were monitored 3, 10, 12, 14,
   and 15 months after the final treatments were implemented. At 15 months
   post-treatment, tall fescue cover was reduced in all treatment plots
   relative to the untreated control, with the greatest reduction in tall
   fescue cover occurring in the summer treatment plots. Spring
   applications of each herbicide were more effective for Kentucky
   bluegrass control than summer or fall treatments. All herbicide
   treatments reduced Kentucky bluegrass compared to untreated plots. The
   most effective herbicide treatment was imazapic + glyphosate, which
   reduced Kentucky bluegrass cover to less than 7\%. However, the
   resulting bare ground facilitated invasions by other aggressive exotic
   species, notably musk thistle (Carduus nutans L.). Spring applications
   of clethodim reduced Kentucky bluegrass cover relative to the untreated
   plots, and resulted in the highest number of native plant species
   compared to all other plots. This conservation of forb cover provided by
   clethodim may be of importance in managing areas impaired by this
   aggressive, invasive grass.}},

Abstract = {{Native prairie plant communities are among the most endangered habitats
   due to extensive agricultural use and exotic species invasion.
   Understanding how species composition, particularly of exotic species,
   varies with environment is essential for management and preservation of
   these communities. In semi-arid prairies, plant establishment is often
   heterogeneous across the landscape and depends on the patchy
   availability of resources across environmental gradients. We studied how
   soil geologic substrate, topography, and grazing history relate to
   patterns of native and exotic plant distribution in a semi-arid Mima
   mound prairie in eastern Washington. We analyzed the relationship
   between native and exotic species richness and abundance on 61 Mima
   mounds in a prairie underlain by two types of soil geologic substrate
   (glacial alluvium and basalt) where half of each had been grazed
   recently. We found that exotic species richness and cover were lowest
   and native species cover was highest on mounds underlain by basalt
   bedrock that had experienced recent grazing; on sites underlain by
   glacial alluvium there was little difference between more and less
   recently grazed mounds. Moreover, we found that exotic abundance was
   greatest at the top of Mima mounds compared to the sides; the opposite
   was true for native species. Our findings indicate that geologic
   substrate and grazing history may interact to determine plant
   distribution in semi-arid prairie communities. This study demonstrates
   that land managers aiming to restore native plant communities need to
   consider the synergistic effects of multiple environmental factors in
   order to focus restoration funding and effort.}},

Abstract = {{Ungulate herbivory can fundamentally affect terrestrial vegetation at
   the landscape and regional levels, but its impact has never been
   analyzed from meta-community perspectives. Here, we study a
   meta-community of forest ground-layer plants in a warm-temperate region
   along a clear gradient of deer density interplaying with gradients of
   other environmental factors (forest type, sky openness and topographic
   wetness). Canonical corresponding analysis showed that deer density was
   the most important determinant of species distributions. These
   distributions conformed to a two-directional filtering model, which
   selects for competitive species at low deer density but favours
   herbivory-tolerant plants at high deer density, with these two
   directions counterbalancing each other when herbivory is intermediary.
   This resulted in a bi-directionally nested meta-community, in which
   local species richness was highest at intermediate levels of deer
   density, conforming also to the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Our
   results suggest that herbivory can be the most important driver of
   meta-community structure in mesic systems; this contrasts with the
   results of earlier studies conducted in harsh environments, where
   species sorting by abiotic factors at early life stages reduced the role
   of biotic interactions, including herbivory.}},

Abstract = {{Question Can grazing by goats eliminate potentially combustible plant
   biomass and thereby change the flammability of mediterranean vegetation?
   Location Donana Natural Park, SW Spain. Methods The effect of goat
   grazing was evaluated, over a period of 42 mo, in 100 ha of pine forest
   understorey with an average density of 217 trees.ha-1. Grazing by large
   herbivores was halted temporarily in the study area, with wild deer
   excluded from 1970, and domestic goats excluded from 2002. However,
   following the creation of grazing exclusion plots and sampling of the
   vegetation within as a control, adult female Payoya goats were
   introduced to the area in spring 2007. Vegetation was sampled twice
   yearly using the point-intercept method, and data of frequency, cover
   and phytovolume obtained. The study was completed with an analysis of
   change in the flammability of the study area (determined using data on
   the phytovolume and flammability of species). Changes in species
   richness and species diversity were determined. Results After 42 mo, the
   phytovolume of the ungrazed vegetation had increased significantly by
   32\%, while bare soil had decreased by 5\%. This gave rise to a
   significant increase in flammability of 25\%. Within the grazed area,
   species phytovolume decreased significantly by 34\%, leading to a
   significant increase in bare soil of 51\%, while the flammability of the
   area decreased by 22\%. The number of species remained constant
   throughout the study at 20 species. Significant differences in species
   diversity were observed between grazed and ungrazed areas after 42 mo of
   grazing (species diversity index after 42 mo of exclusion = 1.59 +/-
   0.17, species diversity index after 42 mo of grazing = 0.95 +/- 0.13).
   Conclusions Monitoring of the scrub understorey has shown the positive
   impact of grazing goats: the resulting decrease in the quantity of total
   phytovolume (easily combustible vegetation) induces changes in species
   diversity without lowering species richness and reduces the risk of
   fire.}},

Title = {{New method for extracting plant indicators based on their adaptive

Abstract = {{Questions What is the best way to identify plant indicators for
   monitoring the responses of semi-natural grassland communities to
   various management practices (i.e. burning, burning and mowing, burning
   and grazing)? Can a multi-trait plant functional group (PFG) approach
   extract indicator species more effectively than a single-trait approach?
   Location Semi-natural and artificial grasslands in the northern and
   eastern parts of the somma of Mt. Aso, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan.
   Methods We analysed a data set from 203 semi-natural and artificial
   grassland vegetation plots (each 1 m x 1 m), and compared species and
   functional compositions among the management types and between the
   northern and eastern locations using non-metric multidimensional scaling
   (NMDS). Potential indicator species were extracted by indicator species
   analysis (INSPAN) and compared with the results of single-trait and
   multi-trait PFG approaches, which classify plant species into groups
   based on individual or combinations of traits (growth form, life span,
   dispersal mode, flowering season and plant height). Results Only the
   multi-trait PFG approach successfully clustered the vegetation plots for
   each management type. Semi-natural burned-and-grazed grasslands in the
   eastern and northern regions were characterized by a specific PFG among
   21 PFGs, whereas the same three PFGs characterized the burned-and-mowed
   semi-natural grassland of the two regions. The extracted PFGs represent
   combinations of vegetative, dispersal and reproductive traits (e.g.
   short, wind- and animal-dispersed species for grazed semi-natural
   grasslands; tall, summer-flowering forbs for mowed semi-natural
   grasslands). As compared to indicator species extracted by the
   multi-trait PFG approach, INSPAN extracted additional indicator species,
   but some of these were inappropriate. Conclusions We identified PFGs
   representing each management type and characterized species adaptations
   to different disturbance regimes, such as mowing and grazing. Among the
   species extracted by INSPAN, only those classified into the
   representative PFGs can serve as indicators for characterizing managed
   semi-natural grasslands. Our findings indicate that using a multi-trait
   PFG approach can provide reasonable plant indicators for monitoring
   grassland communities throughout the regions when combined with a
   species-based INSPAN approach. This proposed method would contribute to
   the conservation of plant biodiversity in threatened semi-natural grazed
   and mowed grasslands.}},

Title = {{Methods to improve the recruitment of holm-oak seedlings in grazed
   Mediterranean savanna-like ecosystems (dehesas)}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{70}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{11-20}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{``Dehesas{''} are savanna-like ecosystems of human origin that extend
   broadly in the Mediterranean area of the Iberian Peninsula. They consist
   of scattered oaks (mainly Quercus ilex subsp. ballota L. holm-oak), an
   annual grassland layer and interspersed shrubs. These ecosystems, used
   for grazing and wild game, support high plant and animal biodiversity
   and provide important environmental services. At present, Mediterranean
   ``dehesas{''} are endangered by the lack of oak regeneration.
   This paper analyses the efficiency of: (1) using shrubs as nurse plants;
   (2) drip irrigation of seedlings during summer; and (3) a combination of
   the two methods for the restoration of a ``dehesa{''} in a mid-mountain
   Mediterranean area of southern Spain.
   Different techniques were tested to improve the recruitment of holm-oak
   seedling during a 3-year field experiment: (1) acorn plantation in open
   spaces, irrigating seedlings during the first dry season; (2) acorn
   plantation beneath the canopy of Myrtus communis L. and (3) both methods
   combined.
   There was a large facilitative effect of myrtle for the recruitment of
   holm-oak seedlings, regardless of the supply of irrigation. This effect
   was associated with a large decrease in air temperature and
   photosynthetically active radiation beneath myrtle canopies. By
   contrast, summer irrigation of seedlings planted in open spaces did not
   improve seedling survival after 3 years despite a small and transient
   positive effect on seedling survival during the 1st year.
   The use of evergreen shrubs, such as myrtle, as nurse plants may be
   considered to restore ``dehesas{''} instead of expensive seedling
   irrigation techniques. Several studies have promoted abandoning grazing
   to increase holm oak self-regeneration in ``dehesas{''}. However,
   creating closed patches of naturally occurring evergreen shrubs could
   provide suitable sites for oak planting when necessary, thus enhancing
   seedling recruitment without damaging the environmental and economic
   value of these ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE \& FORAGE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{99-125}},
Abstract = {{Themeda triandra is a perennial tussock grass endemic to Africa,
   Australia and Asia. Within these regions it is found across a broad
   range of climates, geological substrates and ecosystems. Because it is
   widespread across these areas it has great economic and ecological
   value, as it is a relatively palatable species across most of its range.
   It is of critical importance in supporting local populations of both
   native and introduced herbivores, and is thus central to wildlife and
   livestock production, and consequently rural livelihoods. It is an
   important climax or subclimax species that is well adapted to fire, a
   common element of many areas where it is found. Inappropriate grazing
   management, however, can result in a decline of Themeda, as it is not
   well adapted to an uninterrupted, selective grazing regime. A decline in
   abundance of Themeda in a grassland is usually coupled to a decline in
   grazing value, species richness, cover and ecosystem function. In spite
   of its significant ecological and economic importance, there has been no
   attempt to review and synthesise the considerable body of research
   undertaken on this grass. Our aim is to summarise and synthesis work
   previously undertaken and identify areas where further research is
   required.}},

Abstract = {{Question How are semi-natural ecosystems affected by goat grazing regime
   (heavy, light and long-term abandonment)? Location Anaga Rural Park,
   Tenerife Island, Canary Islands (Spain). Methods We evaluated plant
   species composition, diversity and structure (frequencies of functional
   groups based on growth form and bare ground) for three goat grazing
   regimes using 63 permanent point-quadrat transects. The effect of
   orientation (N vs S slope) was also analysed. Data were collected in the
   spring during each year from 2001 to 2005. Results Grazing regime
   affected the studied functional groups differently. The frequency of
   annual grasses was higher in the heavily grazed areas, shrubs decreased
   sharply from abandoned to heavily grazed areas, and shrub legumes
   appeared less abundant in the lightly grazed transects. An interaction
   between grazing regime and orientation affected some functional groups.
   Grazing led to higher plant diversity, and did not affect the frequency
   of bare ground or native and endemic species. There were no strong
   differences in species composition among the three grazing regimes.
   However, species composition in abandoned areas was characterized by a
   higher abundance of late-successional and endemic shrub species, while
   herbaceous species typical of pastures were more common in the grazed
   areas. Conclusions Grazing regimes noticeably affect the composition and
   structure of the vegetation of semi-natural ecosystems but do not result
   in a complete turnover in species composition. Goat grazing is
   beneficial for maintaining traditional open agroecosystems; however,
   controlling the grazing intensity can avoid negative effects on the
   vegetation, particularly the sharp reduction in shrub and palatable
   species. Some abandoned areas should be maintained to preserve
   grazing-sensitive endemic shrub species in these Canarian semi-natural
   ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{The management of pasture, through the use of appropriate stocking rates

   The impact of animal behaviour on vegetation can be of great importance

   Indeed, a different response in terms of quality of animal products is
   mediated by the ability of animals to concentrate or transform grass
   components, according to the characteristics of the soil. The herbage
   ingested by animals provides them with compounds with aromatic
   characteristics, such as terpenes, and with functional properties
   beneficial for human health, such as carotenoids, vitamins, polyphenols
   and polyunsatured fatty acids. The combination of different ecological
   conditions on different soils through specific management practices
   determines the differentiation of several pasture vegetation their own

   associated with semi-natural grasslands in southern Sweden}},
Journal = {{NATURE CONSERVATION-BULGARIA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{31-48}},
Abstract = {{Currently, we are experiencing biodiversity loss on different spatial
   scales. One of the best studied taxonomic groups in decline is the
   butterflies. Here, we review evidence for such declines using five
   systematic studies from southern Sweden that compare old butterfly
   surveys with the current situation. Additionally, we provide data on
   butterfly and burnet moth extinctions in the region's counties. In some
   local areas, half of the butterfly fauna has been lost during the last
   60-100 years. In terms of extinctions, counties have lost 2-10 butterfly
   and burnet moth species. Land use has changed markedly with key
   butterfly habitats such as hay meadows disappearing at alarming rates.
   Grazed, mixed open woodlands have been transformed into dense coniferous
   forests and clear-cuts, and domestic grazers have been relocated from
   woodlands to arable fields and semi-natural grasslands. Ley has
   increased rapidly and is used for bale silage repeatedly during the
   season. Overall, the changed and intensified land use has markedly
   reduced the availability of nectar resources in the landscape. Species
   that decline in Sweden are strongly decreasing or already extinct in
   other parts of Europe. Many typical grassland species that were numerous
   in former times have declined severely; among those Hesperia comma,
   Lycaena virgaureae, Lycaena hippothoe, Argynnis adippe, and Polyommatus
   semiargus. Also, species associated with open woodlands and wetlands
   such as, Colias palaeno, Boloria euphrosyne and the glade-inhabiting
   Leptidea sinapis have all decreased markedly. Current management
   practise and EU Common Agricultural Policy rules favour intensive
   grazing on the remaining semi-natural grasslands, with strong negative
   effects on butterfly diversity. Abandoned grasslands are very common in
   less productive areas of southern Sweden and these habitats may soon
   become forests. There is an urgent need for immediate action to preserve
   unfertilized, mown and lightly grazed grasslands. It is also crucial to
   encourage that management of abandoned grasslands resumes before it is
   too late. In order to mitigate risks of further species loss and to work
   towards recovery of threatened butterfly populations using best known
   practises, we recommend twelve types of management measures favourable
   for many butterflies.}},

Abstract = {{Research on soil microbiota is one of the frontiers in biodiversity
   research. Bacterivores, such as protozoans, contribute significantly to
   mineralization processes and key ecosystem functions in soil. Protozoan
   grazing on rhizobacteria stimulates microbial mineralization processes
   and thereby indirectly nutrient cycling. Understanding the diversity of
   protozoans and their fundamental functions is essential for knowledge of
   nutrient cycling. However, reliable data on protozoan numbers and
   taxonomic composition in soil are scarce. We compared the occurrence of
   morphotypes of small cultivable protozoans of eight different grassland
   and forest sites in Germany. The investigated sites differed both in
   landscape type and intensity of land use. Additionally, we modified a
   liquid aliquot method to determine protozoan abundances and community
   structure on the morphotype level in soil. Protozoan abundances at the
   investigated sites ranged between 1.7 and 12.7 x 10(4) ind.g(-1) dry
   weight. The dominant groups were various amoebae (49.9 +/- 12.4\%) and
   cercozoans (32.4 +/- 13.2\%), followed by stramenopiles (7.7 +/- 4.2\%),
   euglenozoans (7.5 +/- 7.6\%), apusomonads (1.5 +/- 1.5\%) and ciliates
   (0.5 +/- 0.7\%).
   Heterotrophic flagellates and naked amoebae showed similar contributions
   to total protozoan abundances at all sites. Protozoan abundances were
   slightly higher and more variable in grassland sites compared to forest
   sites. Both habitat types showed a surprisingly similar community
   structure on a rough taxonomic level, but a more diverse pattern at a
   higher taxonomic resolution. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 27}},
Abstract = {{Extensive land-use change in the tropics has produced a mosaic of
   successional forests within an agricultural and cattle-pasture matrix.
   Post-disturbance biodiversity assessments have found that regeneration
   speed depends upon propagule availability and the intensity and duration
   of disturbance. However, reestablishment of species interactions is
   still poorly understood and this limits our understanding of the
   anthropogenic impacts upon ecosystem resilience. This is the first
   investigation that evaluates plant-herbivore interaction networks during
   secondary succession. In particular we investigated succession in a
   Mexican tropical dry forest using data of caterpillar associations with
   plants during 2007-2010. Plant-herbivore networks showed high
   resilience. We found no differences in most network descriptors between
   secondary and mature forest and only recently abandoned fields were
   found to be different. No significant nestedness or modularity network
   structure was found. Plant-herbivore network properties appear to
   quickly reestablish after perturbation, despite differences in species
   richness and composition. This study provides some valuable guidelines
   for the implement of restoration efforts that can enhance ecological
   processes such as the interaction between plants and their herbivores.}},

Title = {{Effects of Grazing Intensity and Environmental Factors on Species

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, we aim to analyze the effect of grazing,
   precipitation and temperature on plant species dynamics in the typical
   steppe of Inner Mongolia, P. R. China. By uncoupling biotic and abiotic
   factors, we provide essential information on the main drivers
   determining species composition and species diversity. Effects of
   grazing by sheep were studied in a controlled experiment along a
   gradient of seven grazing intensities (from ungrazed to very heavily
   grazed) during six consecutive years (2005-2010). The results show that
   plant species composition and diversity varied among years but were
   little affected by grazing intensity, since the experimental years were
   much dryer than the long term average, the abiotic constraints may have
   overridden any grazing effect. Among-year differences were predominantly
   determined by the abiotic factors of precipitation and temperature. Most
   of the variation in species dynamics and coexistence between C3 and C4
   species was explained by seasonal weather conditions, i.e. precipitation
   and temperature regime during the early-season (March-June) were most
   important in determining vegetation dynamics. The dominant C3 species
   Stipa grandis was highly competitive in March-June, when the temperature
   levels were low and rainfall level was high. In contrast, the most
   common C4 species Cleistogenes squarrosa benefited from high
   early-season temperature levels and low early-season rainfall. However,
   biomass of Stipa grandis was positively correlated with temperature in
   March, when effective mean temperature ranges from 0 to 5 degrees C and
   thus promotes vernalization and vegetative sprouting. Our results
   suggest that, over a six-year term, it is temporal variability in
   precipitation and temperature rather than grazing that determines
   vegetation dynamics and species co-existence of grazed steppe
   ecosystems. Furthermore, our data support that the variability in the
   biomass of dominant species, rather than diversity, determine ecosystem
   functioning. The present study provides fundamental knowledge on the
   complex interaction of grazing - vegetation - climate.}},

Title = {{Impact of Land-Use Intensity and Productivity on Bryophyte Diversity in
   Agricultural Grasslands}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 12}},
Abstract = {{While bryophytes greatly contribute to plant diversity of semi-natural
   grasslands, little is known about the relationships between land-use
   intensity, productivity, and bryophyte diversity in these habitats. We
   recorded vascular plant and bryophyte vegetation in 85 agricultural used
   grasslands in two regions in northern and central Germany and gathered
   information on land-use intensity. To assess grassland productivity, we
   harvested aboveground vascular plant biomass and analyzed nutrient
   concentrations of N, P, K, Ca and Mg. Further we calculated mean
   Ellenberg indicator values of vascular plant vegetation. We tested for
   effects of land-use intensity and productivity on total bryophyte
   species richness and on the species richness of acrocarpous (small \&
   erect) and pleurocarpous (creeping, including liverworts) growth forms
   separately. Bryophyte species were found in almost all studied
   grasslands, but species richness differed considerably between study
   regions in northern Germany (2.8 species per 16 m(2)) and central
   Germany (6.4 species per 16 m(2)) due environmental differences as well
   as land-use history. Increased fertilizer application, coinciding with
   high mowing frequency, reduced bryophyte species richness significantly.
   Accordingly, productivity estimates such as plant biomass and nitrogen
   concentration were strongly negatively related to bryophyte species
   richness, although productivity decreased only pleurocarpous species.
   Ellenberg indicator values for nutrients proved to be useful indicators
   of species richness and productivity. In conclusion, bryophyte
   composition was strongly dependent on productivity, with smaller
   bryophytes that were likely negatively affected by greater competition
   for light. Intensive land-use, however, can also indirectly decrease
   bryophyte species richness by promoting grassland productivity. Thus,
   increasing productivity is likely to cause a loss of bryophyte species
   and a decrease in species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Ant assemblages, used widely as bioindicators of land management
   practices, were sampled in rehabilitated pastures and surrounding
   habitats at Norwich Park Coal Mine in central Queensland, Australia. As
   the end-use goal of a number of rehabilitated mine sites in the region
   is sustainable pasture-land, the aim of this study was to investigate
   the influence of varying grazing histories on ant fauna, to provide
   further understanding on the function of rehabilitated agroecosystems
   and multi-trophic interactions. Examination of seven study sites
   revealed three distinct ant assemblages, broadly reflecting mining and
   grazing history. Rehabilitated pastures where grazing had ceased 2 years
   prior to ant sampling contained low species richness with a basic ant
   composition, regardless of stocking rate, and was similar to ungrazed
   rehabilitated pasture. The rehabilitated pasture with continual low
   intensity grazing showed ant compositional similarities' to the
   neighboring unmined pasture, although assemblage descriptors were
   intermediate between unmined and rehabilitated sites. Buffel grass
   (Pennisetum ciliare, basionym Cenchrus ciliaris) and other stoloniferous
   or rhizomatous grasses were the principal influence on ant assemblages,
   with grazing reducing the ground dominance of such grasses and providing
   a more favorable habitat for a wider range of ant species. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The Ernest Henry Mine in north west Queensland, Australia, is required
   to return disturbed land to native grassland and has been undertaking
   extensive revegetation of waste rock dumps since 2002. To ascertain the
   trajectories for revegetation success of these rehabilitated native
   grasslands, annual vegetation monitoring of both rehabilitation sites
   and selected reference areas has been undertaken since 2007. Long-term
   monitoring efforts have included assessments of vegetation composition,
   ecological structure and function at four rehabilitation areas (1-7
   years post-rehabilitation) and proximal reference sites within
   surrounding grazed and ungrazed agro-ecosystems, undisturbed by mining.
   Our findings demonstrated that the oldest rehabilitated sites had
   similar species composition and functional elements to selected
   reference sites, although plant cover and biomass (particularly of
   native grasses) was lower than both grazed and ungrazed reference areas.
   The youngest sites had little established vegetation, however species
   richness was similar to the reference sites and functional life forms
   were present despite being in very low abundance. It is suggested that
   future monitoring events and informed management inputs (which consider
   local climatic conditions and soil fertility factors) could contribute
   to the development of a stable and sustainable native grassland thus
   achieving the desired end land use on these post-industrial landscapes.

Abstract = {{In protected areas maintaining existing phytodiversity is an important
   conservation target. In this study we analysed the effects of
   abandonment on plant species composition and species richness over a
   period of nine years in a montane grassland in the Long-term Ecosystem
   Research (LTER) region Eisenwurzen (Styria, Austria). Additional
   investigations concerned the number of Red Data List species, plant
   strategy types, Ellenberg indicator values, indicator values for mowing,
   grazing and trampling tolerance, temporal sequence of phenological
   phases and seven plant traits. We differentiated two topography-related
   habitat types: an initially species-rich sheep pasture on a steep,
   south-facing slope and a less species-rich meadow on a flat site
   immediately below, with a comparatively higher nutrient and water supply
   in the topsoil. Testing a possible management alternative, the effects
   of continued low-intensity sheep grazing on the slope were also
   analysed. In spring 2001, one permanent plot of 50 m(2) was established
   in the centre of each habitat type and treatment. Our results show that
   the long-term effects of abandonment on grassland vegetation depend
   largely on local site conditions. Nutrient availability in the soil
   seems to be an especially important factor. On the abandoned flat site,
   floristic composition and physiognomy changed dramatically within four
   years; a high species turnover and a decline in phytodiversity could be
   observed. In contrast, we found only minor effects on the abandoned
   slope site even nine years after abandonment. If the maintenance of
   existing phytodiversity is a conservation target, suitable management
   operations have to be carried out at shorter intervals (at least every 3
   years) in habitats with nutrient-rich soils than in nutrient-poor
   habitats (approx. 5 to 10 years). From a nature conservation point of
   view, low-intensity sheep grazing may be a suitable management
   alternative to mowing.}},

Abstract = {{Plant identity and diversity influence herbivore communities in many
   different ways. While it is well known how they affect the feeding
   preferences of aboveground herbivores, this information is lacking for
   soil ecosystems, where examining plant-herbivore trophic interactions is
   difficult. We performed a mesocosm experiment assessing how plant
   identity and diversity affect the food choice of Agriotes larvae, which
   are soil-living generalist herbivores. We offered four plant species,
   (maize, a grass, a legume, and a forb) at varying combinations and
   diversity levels to these larvae, and analyzed their feeding behavior
   using stable isotopes. We hypothesized that (1) their food choice is
   driven by preference for certain plant species rather than by root
   abundance and that (2) the preference for specific plants changes with
   increasing plant diversity. We found that larvae preferred the grass and
   legume but avoided maize and the forb. Whether a plant was preferred or
   avoided was independent of diversity, but the extent of avoidance or
   preference changed with increasing plant diversity. Our findings reveal
   that the dietary choice of soil-living generalist herbivores is
   determined by plant-specific traits rather than root abundance. Our data
   also suggest that soil herbivore feeding preferences are modulated by
   plant diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Invertebrate herbivores can impact plant performance and plant
   communities. Conversely, plants can affect the ability of herbivores to
   find, choose, and consume them through their functional traits. While
   single plant traits have been related to rates of herbivory, most often
   involving single herbivore-plant pairs, much less is known about which
   suite of plant traits is important for determining herbivory for a pool
   of plant species interacting with a natural herbivore community. In this
   study we measured aboveground herbivore damage on 51 herbaceous species
   growing in monocultures of a grassland biodiversity experiment and
   collected 42 different plant traits representing four trait groups:
   physiological, morphological, phenological, and herbivore related. Using
   the method of random forests and multiple regression, we identified
   seven traits that are important predictors of herbivore damage (leaf
   nitrogen and lignin concentration, number of coleopteran and hemipteran
   herbivores potentially feeding on the plants, leaf life span, stem
   growth form, and root architecture); leaf nitrogen and lignin
   concentration were the two most important predictors. The final model
   accounted for 63\% of the variation in herbivore damage. Traits from all
   four trait groups were selected, showing that a variety of plant
   characteristics can be statistically important when assessing folivory,
   including root traits. Our results emphasize that it is necessary to use
   a multivariate approach for identifying traits affecting complex
   ecological processes such as herbivory.}},

Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{In Europe and North America, there is growing concern that biodiversity
   declines associated with agricultural intensification will adversely
   impact the functioning and sustainability of agricultural ecosystems.
   Enhancing habitat heterogeneity in agricultural landscapes promotes
   biodiversity and, whilst erecting fences adjacent to watercourses is
   widely advocated as a means of mitigating diffuse pollution, associated
   biodiversity benefits have been largely overlooked. A range of riparian
   margins and their adjacent grassland fields were investigated to
   determine the effects of riparian management on the diversity and
   functional structure of carabid assemblages. Carabid assemblages of
   fields and open margins (i.e. unfenced watercourses) were more diverse
   and species rich than those of fenced margins. The functional structure
   of carabid assemblages in fenced margins differed from grassland fields
   and open margins. This disparity was greater in wide margins (i.e.
   fences erected over 5.4 m from watercourses) than narrow margins (i.e.
   fences erected within 2.6 m of watercourses). Wide margins had the
   highest relative proportions of carabids which had pushing body forms,
   were flightless, very small in size and Collembola specialists. During
   early summer, wide margins also had the highest proportion of carabids
   that overwinter as adults. The taxonomic and functional structure of
   carabid assemblages was more sensitive for detecting impacts of
   agricultural management than measurements of diversity. It is likely
   that this also applies to other taxa, thus emphasising the need to
   consider a wide range of assemblage attributes when investigating
   agricultural impacts on biodiversity. Synthesis and applications. Fenced
   riparian margins, particularly those over 5.4 m wide, harbour carabids
   with poor dispersal ability which are vulnerable to habitat
   fragmentation. While lack of management benefits sedentary species, a
   wider range of taxa (e.g. pollinators, foraging birds and flowering
   plants) are enhanced by management to obtain a more open vegetation
   structure (e.g. restricted grazing or mowing). It is important that
   management practices are implemented at a sufficiently fine spatial
   scale to allow recolonisation of species with restricted dispersal from
   adjacent undisturbed habitats. Wide riparian margins have the potential
   to enhance taxonomic and functional diversity at the landscape scale.
   Management actions must, however, be carefully balanced to ensure that
   they promote a wide range of taxa without unduly interfering with the
   margin's ability to mitigate diffuse pollution.}},

Abstract = {{Since the early 20th century Patagonian arid steppes have been subjected
   to overgrazing that led to the degradation of plant communities. We
   hypothesized that the interplay among grazing history, plant-plant
   spatial interactions and species traits affects recovery and assemblage
   of shrub community after short-term abandonment in north-eastern
   Patagonian arid steppe (Peninsula Valdes, Argentina). We compared six
   sites (two in grazed pastures, and four in short-term ungrazed pastures,
   two of which intensively grazed, while the other two low intensity
   grazed in the past) with regard to: shrub cover percentage (10 m x 10 m
   plots); shrub patch dimension, species richness, and spatial
   interactions among shrub species depending on patch dimension (patches
   sampled along transects); species richness and composition, vertical
   relations among species, and traits related to avoidance strategies and
   disturbance (1 m x 1 m plots sampled along transects). Our results
   indicated that recovery processes in abandoned pastures act through the
   increase in shrub patch size, formation of new patches, change in patch
   composition and richness, and in within-patch relations among shrub
   species. No significant differences were found between sites subjected
   to different past grazing intensities. The increase in shrub cover was
   due to a significant expansion of the dominant shrub Chuquiraga
   avellanedae. The mechanism of new patch formation and spread was mainly
   based on facilitative processes acting between the dwarf shrubs, poorly
   palatable and disliked by wild herbivores, and young individuals of the
   dominant species emerging from their canopy. As patch size increased,
   dwarf shrubs were covered by taller ones or grew at the edge of the
   patch, indicating a phase of competitive exclusion. Plant-plant spatial
   interactions involved changes in the composition of plant traits linked
   to avoidance strategies, which were indicators of grazed conditions and
   of plots with shrub cover lower than 50\%, while less need for defence
   against animal browsing was highlighted in ungrazed pastures and
   shrub-dominated plots. As the density of herbivores is recognized as the
   key factor in biodiversity conservation and ecosystem recovery,
   management plans devoted to conservation of biodiversity and forage
   resources should work to recreate grazing conditions close to the wild
   ones or to impose a short-term period of ecosystem rest that allows the
   plant community to recover.}},

Abstract = {{The present paper studies butterfly, grasshopper and vascular plant
   communities in ten seasonally flooded grasslands with different
   anthropogenic disturbance regimes (NW Greece). Disturbance intensity was
   assessed on the basis of disturbance frequency and type (grazing,
   mowing, trampling, constructions). The distribution patterns of
   butterflies are regulated by humidity and elevation (Redundancy
   Analysis). Elevation, flower-heads abundance, low disturbance intensity
   and plant species richness predict grasshopper species richness well,
   while the latter together with humidity predict plant species richness
   (Generalized Linear Models). Chorthippus lacustris, a critically
   endangered endemic grasshopper species, is positively associated with
   humid microhabitats with high flower-heads abundance. An indicator value
   procedure reveals four butterfly species as being typical species for
   habitats with a pronounced character of hedgerows and tree lines.
   Conservation management of grassland butterflies should focus on the
   maintenance of the humid character of the humid grasslands as well as on
   the maintenance of hedgerows and tree lines. The reduction of
   human-induced disturbance towards occasional grazing and mowing seems to
   benefit both butterfly and grasshopper communities. Finally, we suggest
   the use of grasshoppers as surrogates for vascular plants and vice
   versa, given their congruent species richness patterns.}},

Abstract = {{The New Forest National Park is a hotspot for biodiversity in the UK. A
   long history of grazing by ponies in the New Forest landscape has
   created a diverse mosaic of habitats that are of international
   significance. We investigated patterns of species diversity and
   composition across the New Forest landscape by sampling soil, leaf
   litter and ground macrofauna from woodland, grassland and heathland
   plots across the entire landscape. We used a spatially replicated design
   of hand sorted soil pits, Winkler extraction of leaf litter, and pitfall
   traps. We concentrated on diversity patterns of the following target
   groups: Coleoptera, Formicidae, Isopoda, Chilopoda, Diplopoda, Opiliones
   and Lumbricidae. The most striking difference in species assemblages is
   between wooded and open areas. Woodlands are the most diverse habitats
   and have a distinct assemblage, largely due to those leaf litter
   invertebrate species which are only present under a closed canopy. Open
   areas are less diverse, with diversity particularly low in the wet
   grasslands. However, the open areas do have a distinct fauna, especially
   in the wet and dry heaths which are home to a number of rare species,
   particularly of Formicidae. We discuss the potential conservation
   problems facing the New Forest and how these might affect soil
   macrofauna biodiversity in the future and conclude that climate change;
   over-grazing; and land use changes represent the largest threats.
   Although a relatively stable landscape which benefits from protection
   under UK law, changes in grazing intensity or management practices in
   the New Forest, particularly for some of the habitats of European
   importance (e.g. wet heathlands), could negatively affect soil
   macrofauna biodiversity. Climate change may also exacerbate biodiversity
   decline as a result of increased grazing intensity or changes in
   management.}},

Abstract = {{Timber tree plantations are considered for rehabilitating forest
   biodiversity in the tropics, but knowledge on determinants of faunal
   diversity patterns in such human-modified forest landscapes is scarce.
   We quantified the composition of beetle assemblages on three native
   timber species (Anacardium excelsum, Cedrela odorata and Tabebuia rosea)
   planted on former pasture to assess effects of tree species identity,
   tree species diversity, and insecticide treatment on a speciose group of
   animals in tropical plantations. The beetle assemblage parameters
   `abundance', `species richness', `Chao1 estimated species richness' and
   `Shannon diversity' were significantly reduced by insecticide treatment
   for each tree species. Shannon diversity increased with stand
   diversification for T. rosea but not for A. excelsum and C. odorata.
   Species similarity was highest (lowest species turnover) between beetle
   assemblages on T. rosea, and it was lowest (highest species turnover)
   for assemblages on insecticide-treated trees of all timber species.
   Considering trophic guilds, herbivorous beetles dominated on all tree
   species and in all planting schemes. Herbivores were significantly more
   dominant on T. rosea and C. odorata than on A. excelsum, suggesting that
   tree species identity affects beetle guild structure on plantation
   trees. Insecticide-treated stands harbored less herbivores than
   untreated stands, but exhibited a high abundance of predator beetle
   species. Our study revealed that even young pasture-afforestations can
   host diverse beetle assemblages and thus contribute to biodiversity
   conservation in the tropics. The magnitude of this contribution,
   however, may strongly depend on management measures and on the selected
   tree species.}},

Abstract = {{Little is known about the immediate effect of high nitrogen (N),
   phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) application rates on sown grasslands
   cut twice per year. We asked how quickly plant species composition,
   biomass yield, biomass chemical properties and nutrient balance respond
   to N, P and K application. An experiment using unfertilized control, P,
   N, NP and NPK treatments was established on seven-year-old cut grassland
   in the Czech Republic in 2007 and monitored over four years. Annual
   application rates were 300 kg N ha(-1), 80 kg P ha(-1) and 200 kg K
   ha(-1). The immediate response of plant species composition to N
   application was recorded and was found to be different to the response
   over the four years of the study period. Highly productive grasses
   (Dactylis glomerata, Festuca arundinacea and Phleum pratense) were
   promoted by N application in 2008 and then retreated together with
   legumes (Medicago sativa, Trifolium pratense and Trifolium repens) in
   all N treatments where the expansion of perennial forbs (Urtica dioica
   and Rumex obtusifolius) and annual weeds (Galinsoga quadriradiata,
   Impatiens parviflora, Lamium purpureum and Stellaria media) was
   recorded. At the end of the experiment, Festuca rubra was the dominant
   grass in the control and P treatment, and species richness was lowest in
   all treatments with N application. Mean annual dry-matter yield over all
   years was 3.5, 3.9, 5.8, 5.6 and 6.8 t ha(-1) in the control, P, N, NP
   and NPK treatments, respectively. Concentrations of N in the biomass
   ranged from 20.0 to 28.7 g kg(-1) in the P and N treatments;
   concentrations of P ranged from 3.2 to 3.7 g kg(-1) in the N and P
   treatments; and concentrations of K ranged from 24.1 to 34.0 g kg(-1) in
   the NP and NPK treatments. The N:P, N:K and K:P ratios did not correctly
   indicate the nutrient limitation of biomass production, which was
   primarily N-limited, and K-limitation was only recorded for high
   production levels in treatments with N applications. On the basis of the
   nutrient-balance approach, the balanced annual application rates were
   estimated as 140 kg N ha(-1), 30 kg P ha(-1) and 100 kg K ha(-1). We
   concluded that high N, P and K application rates can very quickly and
   dramatically change species composition, biomass production and its
   chemical properties in sown cut grasslands. High N application rates can
   be detrimental for tall forage grasses and can support the spread of
   weedy species.}},

Abstract = {{Grassland biomass has been identified as a potential energy source. The
   combustion of mature and fibrous biomass, as occurs in extensive
   grasslands managed with low cutting frequencies, is one possible
   conversion technique. This study tested the relationship between plant
   diversity and biomass constituents relevant for combustion, as they
   determine energy content, energy yield and emission and corrosion risks.
   The biomass from a biodiversity experiment, with a species richness (SR)
   gradient of 160 species from Central European mesophilic grasslands
   divided into four functional groups (grasses, legumes, small and tall
   herbs), was harvested twice a year (in 2008 and 2009). The higher
   heating value (HHV) was estimated from carbon, hydrogen and oxygen
   contents to give insight into the energy potential of the species
   mixtures. The potential risk of emission and corrosion was assessed by
   analysing ash content, potassium, calcium, magnesium, nitrogen, sulphur
   and chloride content. HHV was independent of SR, and the overall mean
   was 18.13 MJ kg(-1) DM. Biomass and gross energy (GE) yield were
   positively affected by SR. The presence of legumes in a mixture resulted
   in increased HHV, biomass yield and GE, irrespective of the level of SR.
   Annual GE varied between 59 (average of monocultures) and 152 GJ ha(-1)
   year(-1) (mixture of sixty species). The concentration of ash-forming
   elements was generally high, suggesting a pre-treatment of the biomass
   prior to combustion. Emission- and corrosion-related constituents were
   clearly affected by the different functional groups, and sulphur and
   nitrogen both declined with SR. The results of this study show that high
   SR in experimental grassland communities is beneficial for the energy
   output and that legumes play a key role for the energy potential.
   However, identifying a functional group as being solely beneficial or
   disadvantageous for fuel quality was difficult.}},

Abstract = {{1. Precipitation is considered to be a key driver of ecosystem processes
   in mesic grasslands, and climate models predict changes in the amount
   and intensity of precipitation under future global change scenarios.
   Although most experimental rainfall studies decrease precipitation,
   seasonal rainfall is predicted to increase in the northern Great Plains
   under climate change.
   2. We analysed changes in community composition and structure of upland
   and lowland native tallgrass prairie in central Kansas, USA, subjected
   to 19 years of irrigation designed to eliminate moisture stress
   throughout the growing season.
   3. Irrigation had limited effects on species richness in both upland and
   lowland prairie. Total cover increased significantly and consistently
   with irrigation in drier uplands and in more mesic lowlands. Abundance
   of rhizomatous, tall, perennial species as well as C3 forbs increased
   with irrigation.
   4. The strongest response to irrigation came within the dominant
   functional type, C4 perennial grasses. Panicum virgatum became the
   dominant species in irrigated lowlands, whereas Andropogon gerardii
   remained the dominant species in irrigated uplands and in control plots.
   Overall, irrigation had less effect on community composition and
   structure than other known drivers of grassland structure and function.
   5. In comparison with other studies, our results demonstrate that water
   addition has less of an impact than fire, grazing or nitrogen addition
   on composition and dynamics in this mesic grassland. The strongest
   response to long-term irrigation occurred within the dominant functional
   type: tall, perennial, rhizomatous, C4 grasses. Thus, functional
   redundancy will buffer this ecosystem from potential increases in
   rainfall due to climate change. Finally, our results highlight the
   limited utility of qualitative functional traits to predict how this
   mesic grassland will respond to climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The Eurasian steppe has long been subject to grazing by domestic
   ungulates at high levels, resulting in widespread deterioration of
   biodiversity and ecosystem services. While abundant evidence
   demonstrates that heavy grazing alters the ecosystem structure and
   function of grasslands, research on how grazing specifically affects
   ecosystem functioning and stoichiometry on broad scales is scarce
   because of a lack of adequate ungrazed reference sites. We examined the
   effects of grazing on ecosystem functioning and C : N : P stoichiometry
   across a precipitation gradient along the 700 km ChinaMongolia transect
   (CMT), covering three community types: meadow steppe, typical steppe and
   desert steppe. Long-term grazing has dramatically altered the C, N and P
   pools and stoichiometry of steppe ecosystems along the CMT. Grazing
   reduced the C, N and P pools in above-ground biomass and litter, while
   the responses in below-ground biomass and soil C, N and P pools to
   grazing differed substantially among community types. Grazing increased
   N content and decreased C : N ratios in all plant compartments,
   suggesting accelerated N cycling. The altered C : N : P stoichiometry
   may be explained by changes in the composition of species and functional
   groups as well as increased foliar N and P contents for the same species
   in grazed communities. Synthesis and applications. Plant stoichiometric
   responses to grazing ranged from large in the meadow steppe to small in
   the typical steppe to generally insignificant in the desert steppe,
   implying that different underlying mechanisms operated along the
   regional precipitation gradient. Our findings suggest that reducing the
   stocking rate and restoring the vastly degraded steppes are essential to
   sustain native steppe biodiversity, ecosystem functioning and biological
   capacity for mitigating the impact of climate change in the Inner
   Mongolia grassland.}},

Title = {{Impact of grazing management on hibernating caterpillars of the

Abstract = {{Semi-natural grasslands are increasingly grazed by large herbivores for
   nature conservation purposes. For many insects such grazing is essential
   for the conservation of their habitat, but at the same time, populations
   decrease at high grazing intensity. We hypothesised that grazing
   management may cause increased butterfly mortality, especially for
   life-stages with low mobility, such as hibernating caterpillars. To test
   this, we measured the effect of sheep grazing on overwinter larval
   survival. We used the Glanville fritillary (Melitaea cinxia), which has
   gregarious caterpillars hibernating in silk nests, as a model species.
   Caterpillar nests were monitored throughout the hibernating period in
   calcareous grassland reserves with low and high intensity sheep grazing
   and in an ungrazed control treatment. After grazing, 64 \% of the nests
   at the high intensity grazing treatment were damaged or missing,
   compared to 8 and 12 \% at the ungrazed and low intensity grazing
   treatment, respectively. Nest volume and caterpillar survival were 50 \%
   lower at the high intensity grazing treatment compared to both ungrazed
   and low intensity grazing treatments. Nest damage and increased
   mortality were mainly caused by incidental ingestion of the caterpillars
   by the sheep. It is likely that grazing similarly affects other
   invertebrates, depending on their location within the vegetation and
   their ability to actively avoid herbivores. This implies that the impact
   of grazing strongly depends on the timing of this management in relation
   to the phenology of the species. A greater focus on immature and
   inactive life-stages in conservation policy in general and particularly
   in action plans for endangered species is required to effectively
   preserve invertebrate diversity.}},

Title = {{Meta-analysis of ANPP and rain-use efficiency confirms indicative value
   for degradation and supports non-linear response along precipitation
   gradients in drylands}},

Abstract = {{Questions In drylands above-ground net primary production (ANPP) and
   rain-use efficiency (RUE) are common ecological indicators for assessing
   ecosystem state, including degradation and supply of key ecosystem
   services. However, both indicators have been criticized as lumped
   parameters, since they aggregate complex information. Their value as
   ecological parameters in decision-making and their use in ecological
   modelling therefore have been challenged and their explanatory power
   remains unclear. Furthermore, there is no consensus about the response
   of ANPP and RUE along precipitation gradients. Methods Taking advantage
   of several long-term studies in (semi-)arid environments where ANPP and
   RUE were recorded, we compiled a data set of 923yr. We used
   meta-analysis to disentangle the effects of different ecological layers
   (climate, soil and land use) on ANPP and RUE. Linear piece-wise quantile
   regression (LPQR) was used to analyse the response of maximum and median
   ANPP and RUE as functions of precipitation. We assumed that looking at
   maximum response (instead of average response) stratified for land-use
   intensity was an ecologically more plausible way to understand ANPP
   constrained by precipitation and land use. Results We separated the
   impact of different environmental factors into distinct, quantitative
   effect sizes with the aid of meta-analyses. ANPP was affected by recent
   and previous precipitation, land use, soil and biome. LPQR revealed that
   both parameters displayed several sequential linear intersects, which
   together formed a unimodal trend, peaking around precipitation of
   200mmyr-1. Unimodal response was more pronounced for maximum values
   (ANPPmax, RUEmax) than for median values. Peak ANPPmax and RUEmax, as
   well as post-peak decline (>200mmyr-1) were affected by land use: higher
   land-use intensity decreased intercepts and increases post-peak decline.
   Conclusions Our results have important consequences for the use of RUE
   as an ecosystem indicator and a tool in ecosystem monitoring and
   decision-making. Most importantly, grasslands, shrublands and savannas
   significantly differ in their primary production, with a biome-specific
   importance of precipitation, land use and previous year's precipitation.
   We thus propose to establish biome-specific reference values of maximum
   and average RUE. Our study also contributes to reconcile contradictory
   findings for ANPP and RUE response along precipitation gradients of
   varying length.}},

Abstract = {{Feral goats (Capra hircus) are estimated to cause >AUD\$25 million of
   losses to pastoralism per year. Feral goats contribute to soil erosion,
   shrub defoliation, pasture degradation, and compete with stock for
   browse. Feral goats also impact threatened plants such as curly barked
   wattle (Acacia curranii), and land degradation by goats is considered a
   Key Threatening Process under the Australian Commonwealth Environment
   Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. However, many
   pastoralists supplement their incomes by harvesting feral goats for
   their meat, fiber, skins, and for live export; this is an industry worth
   >AUD\$73 million/year. In consideration of the commercial industry
   associated with feral goats, we evaluated a non-lethal form of
   management using predator odors at The University of Queensland's
   Darbalara Research Farm (Australia) in 2008. We evaluated fecal samples
   from lion (Panthera leo), tiger (P. tigris), and dingo (Canis lupus
   dingo) as area deterrents. Dingo fecal odor was not an effective
   deterrent for goats. Tiger fecal odor affected goat movement patterns,
   which resulted in a shift away from the test area (P = 0.01). The use of
   both lion and tiger fecal odors resulted in test animals moving their
   resting sites away from the test areas (lion, P = 0.03; tiger, P =
   0.03). These results show that both lion and tiger fecal odors can be
   used to manipulate resource use by goats by affecting grazing patterns
   and shifting goat resting sites. (c) 2012 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional community indices, i.e. Shannon diversity and Simpson's
   dominance, are generally used to describe biological assemblages in
   order to infer ecological trends about the effects of disturbance. Such
   indices are correlated with species richness and abundance and may be
   strongly influenced by the sampling effort. Conversely, taxonomic
   relatedness indices show interesting statistical properties and are
   independent of the sampling effort. Additionally, high values of
   taxonomical relatedness indices have proven to reflect habitat
   functionality in marine ecosystems. Their use in terrestrial ecosystems
   is rare, and despite their good potential, they have never been used for
   biodiagnostic purposes. In this paper, we present the 1st application of
   taxonomic relatedness indices to arthropod assemblages (namely spiders
   and carabids) and their comparison with several traditional community
   parameters that are generally used to evaluate environmental
   disturbances. The study was set in a wetland area within the Natural
   Reserve of Fondo Toce (northwestern Italy). Four different habitats with
   different degrees of disturbance (a reed bed, a mown meadow, a riparian
   wood with mesophilous elements, and a transitional mesohygrophilic area
   invaded by non-native vegetation) were sampled using pitfall traps. The
   spider and carabid assemblages occurring in each habitat were
   characterized by means of multidimensional scaling (MDS) and by several
   community parameters, including abundance, species richness diversity,
   taxonomic relatedness indices, and some descriptive functional traits.
   Differences among habitats were tested with generalized linear models.
   Correlations among community parameters were evaluated with Spearman's
   rank correlations. According to the MDS plots, both assemblages were
   clearly separated in relation to habitat type. When considering the
   parameters describing the assemblages in relation to disturbance, the
   taxonomic approach was found to be particularly suitable for spiders,
   for which the less-disturbed habitat was characterized by higher values
   of average taxonomic distinctness. Furthermore, functional groups of
   spiders were more evenly distributed in undisturbed habitats. The
   functional approach was found particularly appropriate for carabids,
   which responded to disturbance in terms of a decrease in biomass
   (average body size) and an increase in the proportional abundance of
   macropterous individuals.

Abstract = {{Comparisons of related species differing in conservation status may
   offer insights into causes of species declines. We studied egg-laying
   patterns and landscape occupancy of two sympatric lycaenidae butterflies
   inhabiting xeric grasslands, vulnerable Polyommatus thersites and
   critically endangered Polyommatus {[}Agrodiaetus] damon, both developing
   on sainfoin, Onobrychis spp. Females of bivoltine P. thersites oviposit
   on host plant leaves at a relatively low height (a parts per thousand 20
   cm), in both spring (May-June) and summer (July-August) generations.
   Females of univoltine P. damon (July-September) oviposit to senescing
   inflorescences, in significantly higher heights (> 30 cm), and the
   species is hence vulnerable to summer mowing or grazing. On a landscape
   scale, both species tended to occur at sites with diverse sward
   management, including temporarily unmanaged patches. In addition, P.
   damon occurred only in the proximity of other occupied sites. The study
   documents that grassland management must respect the needs of the most
   vulnerable species, and because these needs are seldom known, it must
   maintain a high diversity of conditions within individual sites.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates how yellow bluestem affects biodiversity in a
   typical Pannonian grassland. Beta diversity (i.e. the finescale spatial
   variability of species compositions), was estimated by the realized
   number of species combinations sampled at various scales. Sampling was
   performed by a standard protocol. Presences of plant species were
   recorded along 52.2 m long belt transect of 1044 units of 0.05x0.05 m
   contiguous microquadrats. According to the results the massive presence
   of tested C-4 grass significantly reduced species richness of the
   grassland. Beta diversity assessment revealed that 90\% of species
   combinations were lost due to yellow bluestem invasion. Fine-scale
   spatial pattern analyses showed complete local extinctions of other
   species from microsites dominated by yellow bluestem. This local
   extinction is enhanced by the specific clonal architecture of this
   species and by the accumulation of litter. Other dominant grasses had no
   effect on fine scale diversity, i.e. they could coexist well with other
   elements of the local flora. This study presents currently developed
   microhabitat types, forecasts and also draws attention to the danger
   that climate warming will probably enhance the spread of this
   detrimental C-4 species.}},

   in Smallholder Fallows in Western Kenya}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies indicate that species richness can enhance the ability of
   plant assemblages to support multiple ecosystem functions. To understand
   how and when ecosystem services depend on biodiversity, it is valuable
   to expand beyond experimental grasslands. We examined whether plant
   diversity improves the capacity of agroecosystems to sustain multiple
   ecosystem services-production of wood and forage, and two elements of
   soil formation-in two types of smallholder fallows in western Kenya. In
   18 grazed and 21 improved fallows, we estimated biomass and quantified
   soil organic carbon, soil base cations, sand content, and soil
   infiltration capacity. For four ecosystem functions (wood biomass,
   forage biomass, soil base cations, steady infiltration rates) linked to
   the focal ecosystem services, we quantified ecosystem service
   multi-functionality as (1) the proportion of functions above
   half-maximum, and (2) mean percentage excess above mean function values,
   and assessed whether plant diversity or environmental favorability
   better predicted multi-functionality. In grazed fallows, positive
   effects of plant diversity best explained the proportion above
   half-maximum and mean percentage excess, the former also declining with
   grazing intensity. In improved fallows, the proportion above
   half-maximum was not associated with soil carbon or plant diversity,
   while soil carbon predicted mean percentage excess better than
   diversity. Grazed fallows yielded stronger evidence for diversity
   effects on multi-functionality, while environmental conditions appeared
   more influential in improved fallows. The contrast in
   diversity-multi-functionality relationships among fallow types appears
   related to differences in management and associated factors including
   disturbance and species composition. Complementary effects of species
   with contrasting functional traits on different functions and
   multi-functional species may have contributed to diversity effects in
   grazed fallows. Biodiversity and environmental favorability may enhance
   the capacity of smallholder fallows to simultaneously provide multiple
   ecosystem services, yet their effects are likely to vary with fallow
   management.}},

Title = {{Understanding Plant Community Responses to Combinations of Biotic and
   Abiotic Factors in Different Phases of the Plant Growth Cycle}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Understanding plant community responses to combinations of biotic and
   abiotic factors is critical for predicting ecosystem response to
   environmental change. However, studies of plant community regulation
   have seldom considered how responses to such factors vary with the
   different phases of the plant growth cycle. To address this deficit we
   studied an aquatic plant community in an ecosystem subject to gradients
   in mute swan (Cygnus olor) herbivory, riparian shading, water
   temperature and distance downstream of the river source. We quantified
   abundance, species richness, evenness, flowering and dominance in
   relation to biotic and abiotic factors during the growth-, peak-, and
   recession-phases of the plant growth cycle. We show that the relative
   importance of biotic and abiotic factors varied between plant community
   properties and between different phases of the plant growth cycle.
   Herbivory became more important during the later phases of peak
   abundance and recession due to an influx of swans from adjacent pasture
   fields. Shading by riparian vegetation also had a greater depressing
   effect on biomass in later seasons, probably due to increased leaf
   abundance reducing light intensity reaching the aquatic plants. The
   effect of temperature on community diversity varied between upstream and
   downstream sites by altering the relative competitiveness of species at
   these sites. These results highlight the importance of seasonal patterns
   in the regulation of plant community structure and function by multiple
   factors.}},

   Invasion in Tropical Australia}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Habitat disturbance and the spread of invasive organisms are major
   threats to biodiversity, but the interactions between these two factors
   remain poorly understood in many systems. Grazing activities may
   facilitate the spread of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) through
   tropical Australia by providing year-round access to otherwise-seasonal
   resources. We quantified the cane toad's use of cowpats (feces piles) in
   the field, and conducted experimental trials to assess the potential
   role of cowpats as sources of prey, water, and warmth for toads. Our
   field surveys show that cane toads are found on or near cowpats more
   often than expected by chance. Field-enclosure experiments show that
   cowpats facilitate toad feeding by providing access to dung beetles.
   Cowpats also offer moist surfaces that can reduce dehydration rates of
   toads and are warmer than other nearby substrates. Livestock grazing is
   the primary form of land use over vast areas of Australia, and pastoral
   activities may have contributed substantially to the cane toad's
   successful invasion of that continent.}},

Journal = {{ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{42-49}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Little is known about the effects of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and
   potassium (K) application on soil chemical properties and plant species
   composition of mountain Festuca rubra grasslands. In this study, we
   aimed to determine whether fertiliser application affects plant species
   composition and soil properties during periods of management, and
   whether residual after-effects of fertiliser application can be detected
   eight years after its use is abandoned.
   The experiment with unfertilised control, PK treatment and treatments
   with low and higher level of NPK application under three (intensive
   management from 1993 to 1997) and two cut management (moderate
   management from 1997 to 1999) was established in the Jizera Mts. (Czech
   Republic) on E rubra meadow and then the experiment was eight years
   abandoned.
   Immediately after the introduction of intensive management, a decrease
   in species richness and diversification of plant species composition
   occurred. Plant communities which had diversified in different
   fertiliser treatments persisted under moderately intensive management.
   The cover of Alopecurus pratensis increased to >50\% while the cover of
   Agrostis capillaris decreased to <5\% in NPK treatments during the
   period of intensive management. Trifolium repens became the dominant
   species in the PK treatment. Within eight years, under no management,
   the differences in plant species composition disappeared, species
   richness decreased and E rubra, followed by Hypericum maculatum, became
   dominant in all treatments. The differences in biomass P concentration
   and plant available P and K concentrations in the soil were still
   detectable eight years after the last fertiliser application. As shown
   in this study, moderate application of NPK and consequent abandonment
   need not generate irreversible changes in species composition of
   mountain grassland. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

   (2007, 2008, and 2009). Mean dry matter yield (DMY) increased
   appreciably from post-establishment (3801 kg ha(-1)) to the production
   years (6613 kg ha(-1)). Contrasts revealed significantly higher DMY
   production in quaternary mixtures versus less complex plots in
   production years. Repeated measure analysis found significant quadratic
   trends in DMY for plots containing bluegrass and timothy, showing
   different patterns of growth between the respective mixtures. Principal
   component analysis (PCA) of averaged yields over the production years
   revealed a strong association between seeded grass growth and DMY. This
   relationship between DMY and seeded grass growth was strongest in swards
   containing a combination of timothy and bluegrass. In general, the
   growth of unseeded grasses and forbs increased in mixtures with large
   proportions of timothy and reed canarygrass. In spite of the fact that
   mixtures containing timothy and bluegrass were shown to produce high
   DMY, it appears the aggressiveness of bluegrass suppressed the yield
   potential of timothy. White clover yields and unseeded grasses/forbs
   were both significantly lower in mixtures containing bluegrass. Also,
   the PCA revealed a favourable compatibility between meadow fescue and
   white clover growth, while bluegrass appears to suppress meadow fescue
   growth. Results show that species complexity increases sward
   productivity over the long term, and that the presence of two grass
   species, in particular (timothy and bluegrass), has considerable
   influence on DMY.}},

Abstract = {{Lichens comprise a significant part of forest biota, but their diversity
   patterns are poorly known at medium spatial scales, which are most
   relevant for management planning. We carried out exhaustive lichen
   surveys in two 2-ha plots of old, weakly harvested herb-rich forests in
   Estonia; the field effort exceeded 500 hours for each plot. We recorded
   222 species (194 lichens, 14 lichenicolous and 14 saprobic fungi
   traditionally treated by lichenologists), including 57 species of
   conservation concern. Those numbers form ca. one-third of forest species
   known in this fungal group in Estonia and were very similar in the two
   plots. Bacidia hemipolia f. Czarnota \& Coppins, Lecanora farinaria
   Boner. Porina borreri (Trevis.) D.Hawksw. \& P.James and Phaeocalicium
   tremulicola (Norrl. ex Nyl.) Tibell are reported as new to Estonia, and
   several other rare or little-known species were found. Many putative
   `old-growth indicator species' formed local populations of substantial
   size. Using a fixed-effort approach (based on 4 survey hours per 2 ha)
   we demonstrate that the species richness in the studied stands exceeds
   that previously found in conventionally managed 2-ha stands and is not
   smaller than in old growth of similar site type. These results indicate
   that old selectively cut forests can provide valuable microhabitats and
   host rich lichen communities, and they represent a useful option for
   enhancing biodiversity in forest landscapes managed predominantly by
   even-aged systems.}},

Title = {{Omnipresence of leaf herbivory by invertebrates and leaf infection by
   fungal pathogens in agriculturally used grasslands of the Swiss Alps,
   but low plant damage}},
Journal = {{ALPINE BOTANY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{122}},

Abstract = {{Agriculturally used grasslands in the Alps are characterised by a
   trade-off between high fodder production in some and high plant species
   richness in others. In contrast to plant species richness and
   production, however, little is known on the relevance of biological
   interactions between plants, invertebrate herbivores, and fungal
   pathogens for grasslands in the Alps. At the time when the vegetation
   was fully developed, but prior to agricultural use, we examined whether
   leaf damage by herbivory and fungal pathogen infection, and their
   diversity, are affected by plant functional group, land use, and
   altitude. Moreover, we studied whether extent and diversity of leaf
   damage are related to each other, to plant species richness, and to
   standing crop. We recorded the leaf area damaged by ten types of
   herbivory and five types of fungal pathogen infection on 12,054 plant
   leaves of legumes, other forbs, and graminoids collected in 215
   grassland parcels in 12 valleys in the Swiss Alps. With 83 \% of all
   leaves infested, herbivory and fungal pathogen infection were
   omnipresent. However, only 2.7 \% leaf area was damaged by herbivory and
   1.2 \% by fungal pathogens. Damage by herbivory was highest on legumes,
   and damage by fungal pathogens was highest on graminoids. More leaf
   damage by herbivory occurred in traditionally mown sites and at lower
   altitudes, while damage by fungal pathogen infection was independent of
   land use and altitude. Most types of herbivory were found on legumes and
   on leaves from fertilised sites, whereas the number of fungal pathogen
   types was highest on graminoids and in unfertilised sites. Larger
   standing crop was associated with higher leaf damage and diversity of
   herbivory types per leaf. Neither damage by herbivory nor by fungal
   pathogens was correlated with plant species diversity. In more plant
   species rich parcels, the number of herbivory types was lower at the
   leaf level, but tended to be higher at the parcel level. Our results
   highlight the omnipresence of plant-herbivore and plant-pathogen
   interactions. They suggest that current land use changes from mowing to
   grazing or to abandonment decrease the diversity of herbivory, and that
   fertilisation decreases pathogen diversity. As our results did not
   reveal conservation conflicts between diversities of plants, herbivores,
   and fungal pathogens, and as the damage from herbivory and pathogens is
   generally low, we conclude that for protecting the high diversity of
   plant-herbivore and plant-pathogen interactions a diverse low-intensity
   land use should be maintained.}},

Title = {{The effects of large herbivores on the landscape dynamics of a perennial
   herb}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{7, SI}},
Pages = {{1411-1421}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims Models assessing the prospects of plant species at
   the landscape level often focus primarily on the relationship between
   species dynamics and landscape structure. However, the short-term
   prospects of species with slow responses to landscape changes depend on
   the factors affecting local population dynamics. In this study it is
   hypothesized that large herbivores may be a major factor affecting the
   short-term prospects of slow-responding species in the European
   landscape, because large herbivores have increased in number in this
   region in recent decades and can strongly influence local population
   dynamics.
   Methods The impact of browsing by large herbivores was simulated on the
   landscape-level dynamics of the dry grassland perennial polycarpic herb
   Scorzonera hispanica. A dynamic, spatially explicit model was used that
   incorporated information on the location of patches suitable for S.
   hispanica, local population dynamics (matrices including the impact of
   large herbivores), initial population sizes and dispersal rate of the
   species. Simulations were performed relating to the prospects of S.
   hispanica over the next 30 years under different rates of herbivory
   (browsing intensity) and varying frequencies of population destruction
   (e.g. by human activity).
   Key Results Although a high rate of herbivory was detected in most
   populations of S. hispanica, current landscape-level dynamics of S.
   hispanica were approximately in equilibrium. A decline or increase of
   over 20\% in the herbivory rate promoted rapid expansion or decline of
   S. hispanica, respectively. This effect was much stronger in the
   presence of population destruction.
   Conclusions Browsing by large herbivores can have a dramatic effect on
   the landscape dynamics of plant species. Changes in the density of large
   herbivores and the probability of population destruction should be
   incorporated into models predicting species abundance and distribution.}},

Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1146-1153}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Primary production and decomposition, two fundamental processes
   determining the functioning of ecosystems, may be sensitive to changes
   in biodiversity and food web interactions.
   2. The impacts of food web interactions on ecosystem functioning are
   generally quantified by experimentally decoupling these linked processes
   and examining either primary production-based (green) or
   decomposition-based (brown) food webs in isolation. This decoupling may
   strongly limit our ability to assess the importance of food web
   interactions on ecosystem processes.
   3. To evaluate how consumer trophic diversity mediates predator effects
   on ecosystem functioning, we conducted a mesocosm experiment and a field
   study using an assemblage of invertebrates that naturally co-occur on
   North Atlantic coastal saltmarshes. We measured the indirect impact of
   predation on primary production and leaf decomposition as a result of
   prey communities composed of herbivores alone, detritivores alone or
   both prey in combination.
   4. We find that primary consumers can influence ecosystem process rates
   not only within, but also across green and brown sub-webs. Moreover, by
   feeding on a functionally diverse consumer assemblage comprised of both
   herbivores and detritivores, generalist predators can diffuse consumer
   effects on decomposition, primary production and feedbacks between the
   two processes.
   5. These results indicate that maintaining functional diversity among
   primary consumers can alter the consequences of traditional trophic
   cascades, and they emphasize the role of the detritus-based sub-web when
   seeking key biotic drivers of plant production. Clearly, traditional
   compartmentalization of empirical food webs can limit our ability to
   predict the influence of food web interactions on ecosystem functioning.}},

Abstract = {{A coastal grassland was used as a model system to examine how grazing
   management, un-grazed (for six years), rabbit grazed or fully grazed
   (ponies 0.2 ha(-1), cattle 0.05 ha(-1) and rabbits 45 ha(-1)), affected
   biodiversity and ecosystem service provision, by measuring an extensive
   suite of biophysical variables as proxies for ecosystem services. For
   `supporting services', nutrient cycling was greatest in un-grazed
   grassland but primary productivity did not differ. The `provisioning
   service' of food production was only provided by fully grazed grassland.
   For grazing effects on `regulating services' total carbon (C) stock did
   not differ and effects on pest regulating invertebrates and pollinator
   abundance were variable. The potential for flood control was considered
   greatest in the un-grazed grassland; with faster water infiltration than
   in the fully grazed grassland. The `cultural service' of environmental
   appreciation was considered higher in fully grazed grassland due to
   significantly greater plant species richness, more forb species and more
   forbs flowering than in un-grazed grassland. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Alpine forages are assumed to have specific effect on ruminal digestion
   when fed to cattle. These effects were investigated in an experiment
   from two perspectives, either by using such forages as a substrate for
   incubation or as feed for a rumen fluid donor cow. In total, six 24-h in
   vitro batch culture runs were performed. Rumen fluid was collected from
   a non-lactating donor cow after having grazed pastures at similar to
   2000m above sea level for 2, 6 and 10 weeks. These `alpine runs' were
   compared with three lowland samplings from before and 2 and 6 weeks
   after the alpine grazing where a silage-concentrate mix was fed. In each
   run, nine replicates of four forages each were incubated. These forages
   differed in type and origin (alpine hay, lowland ryegrass hay,
   grass-maize silage mix, pure hemicullulose) as well as in the content of
   nutrients. Concentrations of phenolic compounds in the incubated forages
   were (g/kg dry matter (DM)): 20 (tannin proportion: 0.47), 8 (0.27), 15
   (0.52) and 0 (0), respectively. Crude protein was highest in the silage
   mix and lowest with hemicullulose, whereas the opposite was the case for
   fiber. The total phenol contents (g/kg DM) for the high altitude and the
   lowland diet of the donor cow were 27 (tannins: 0.50 of phenols) and 12
   (0.27), respectively. Independent of the origin of the rumen fluid, the
   incubation with alpine hay decreased (P < 0.05) bacterial counts,
   fermentation gas amount, volatile fatty acid (VFA) production as well as
   ammonia and methane concentrations in fermentation gas (the latter two
   being not lower when compared with hemicellulose). Alpine grazing of the
   cow in turn increased (P < 0.001) bacterial counts and, to a lesser
   extent, acetate proportion compared with lowland feeding. Further,
   alpine grazing decreased protozoal count (P < 0.05) and VFA production
   (P < 0.001) to a small extent, where as methane remained widely
   unchanged. There were interactions (P < 0.05) between forage type
   incubated and feeding period of the donor cow in protozoal counts,
   acetate : propionate ratio, fermentation gas production and its content
   of methane, in vitro organic matter digestibility and metabolizable
   energy. Although increased phenolic compounds were the most consistent
   common property of the applied alpine forages, a clear attribution to
   certain effects was not possible in this study. As a further result,
   adaptation (long-term for donor cow, short term for 24 h incubations)
   appears to influence the expression of alpine forage effects in ruminal
   fermentation.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty about the effects of warming and grazing on soil nitrogen
   (N) availability, species composition, and aboveground net primary
   production (ANPP) limits our ability to predict how global carbon
   sequestration will vary under future warming with grazing in alpine
   regions. Through a controlled asymmetrical warming (1.2/1.7 degrees C
   during daytime/nighttime) with a grazing experiment from 2006 to 2010 in
   an alpine meadow, we found that warming alone and moderate grazing did
   not significantly affect soil net N mineralization. Although plant
   species richness significantly decreased by 10\% due to warming after
   2008, we caution that this may be due to the transient occurrence or
   disappearance of some rare plant species in all treatments. Warming
   significantly increased graminoid cover, except in 2009, and legume
   cover after 2008, but reduced non-legume forb cover in the community.
   Grazing significantly decreased cover of graminoids and legumes before
   2009 but increased forb cover in 2010. Warming significantly increased
   ANPP regardless of grazing, whereas grazing reduced the response of ANPP
   to warming. N addition did not affect ANPP in both warming and grazing
   treatments. Our findings suggest that soil N availability does not
   determine ANPP under simulated warming and that heavy grazing rather
   than warming causes degradation of the alpine meadows.}},

Abstract = {{The world's grassland ecosystems are shaped in part by a key functional
   group of social, burrowing, herbivorous mammals. Through herbivory and
   ecosystem engineering they create distinctive and important habitats for
   many other species, thereby increasing biodiversity and habitat
   heterogeneity across the landscape. They also help maintain grassland
   presence and serve as important prey for many predators. However, these
   burrowing mammals are facing myriad threats, which have caused marked
   decreases in populations of the best-studied species, as well as
   cascading declines in dependent species and in grassland habitat. To
   prevent or mitigate such losses, we recommend that grasslands be managed
   to promote the compatibility of burrowing mammals with human activities.
   Here, we highlight the important and often overlooked ecological roles
   of these burrowing mammals, the threats they face, and future management
   efforts needed to enhance their populations and grassland ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Recent declines in biodiversity have given new urgency to questions
   about the relationship between land-use change, biodiversity and
   ecosystem processes. Despite the existence of a large body of research
   on the effects of land use on species richness, it is unclear whether
   the effects of land use on species richness are principally direct or
   indirect, mediated by concomitant changes in ecosystem processes.
   Therefore, we compared the direct effects of land use (fertilization,
   mowing and grazing) on species richness with indirect ones (mediated via
   grassland productivity) for grasslands in central Europe. We measured
   the richness and above-ground biomass in 150 grassland plots in 3
   regions of Germany (the so-called Biodiversity Exploratories). We used
   univariate and structural equation models to examine direct and indirect
   land-use effects. The direct effects of mowing (-0.37, effect size) and
   grazing (0.04) intensity on species richness were stronger compared with
   the indirect effects of mowing (-0.04) and grazing (-0.01). However, the
   strong negative effect of fertilization (-0.23) on species richness was
   mainly indirect, mediated by increased productivity compared with the
   weak direct negative effect (-0.07). Differences between regions in
   land-use effects showed five times weaker negative effects of mowing
   (-0.13) in the region with organic soils (Schorfheide-Chorin), strong
   overall negative effects of grazing (-0.29) for the region with organic
   soils opposed to a similar strong positive effect (0.30) in the
   Hainich-Dun region, whereas the Schwabische Alb region displayed a five
   times weaker positive effect (0.06) only. Further, fertilization effects
   on species richness were positive (0.03) for the region with organic
   soils compared to up to 25 times stronger negative effects in the other
   two regions. Synthesis. Our results clearly show the importance of
   studying both direct and indirect effects of land-use intensity. They
   demonstrate the indirect nature, via productivity, of the negative
   effect of fertilization intensity on plant species richness in the
   real-world context of management-induced gradients of intensity of
   fertilization, mowing and grazing. Finally, they highlight that careful
   consideration of regional environments is necessary before attempting to
   generalize land-use effects on species diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Arid regions are prone to drought because annual rainfall accumulation
   depends on a few rainfall events. Natural plant communities are damaged
   by drought, but atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition may enhance the
   recovery of plant productivity after drought. Here, we investigated the
   effect of increasing N deposition on post-drought recovery of grassland
   productivity in the Mongolian steppe, and we examined the influence of
   grazing in this recovery. We added different amounts of N to a Mongolian
   grassland during two sequential drought years (2006 and 2007) and the
   subsequent 3 years of normal rainfall (2008-2010) under grazed and
   nongrazed conditions. Aboveground biomass and number of shoots were
   surveyed annually for each species. Nitrogen addition increased
   grassland productivity after drought irrespective of the grazing regime.
   The increase in grassland productivity was associated with an increase
   in the size of an annual, Salsola collina, under grazed conditions, and
   with an increase in shoot emergence of a perennial, Artemisia adamsii,
   under nongrazed conditions. The addition of low N content simulating N
   deposition around the study area by the year 2050 did not significantly
   increase grassland productivity. Our results suggest that increasing N
   deposition can enhance grassland recovery after a drought even in arid
   environments, such as the Mongolian steppe. This enhancement may be
   accompanied by a loss of grassland quality caused by an increase in the
   unpalatable species A. adamsii and largely depends on future human
   activities and the consequent deposition of N in Mongolia.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{65}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the question of how well the rangeland management
   profession has served conservation of patterns and processes that
   support multiple ecosystem services. We examine the paradigms under
   which rangeland management operates and argue that our profession
   developed under the utilitarian paradigm with the primary goals of
   sustainable forage for livestock production. While optimization of
   multiple rangeland products and services has always been a
   consideration, a comprehensive set of principles have not be been
   developed to advance this concept. We argue that fire and grazing, often
   viewed as mere tools used for production goals, should rather be viewed
   as essential ecosystem processes. Rangeland management continues to
   operate under the utilitarian paradigm appropriate to societal values of
   the 20th century and by and large has failed to provide management
   guidance to reverse degradation of several highly valued ecosystem
   services. We support this argument with evidence that biodiversity has
   declined on rangelands in the past half century and that much of this
   decline is due to management goals that favor a narrow suite of species.
   The full suite of ecosystem services valued by society will only benefit
   by management for heterogeneity, which implies that there is no one goal
   for management and that landscape-level planning is crucial. Explicitly
   incorporating heterogeneity into state-and-transition models is an
   important advancement not yet achieved by our profession. We present new
   principles for rangeland management formed on the basis of conservation
   of pattern and process. While recognizing that many rangelands have
   significant deviations from historic plant communities and disturbance
   regimes, we suggest that management for conservation of pattern and
   process should focus on fire and grazing to the extent possible to
   promote a shifting mosaic across large landscapes that include patches
   that are highly variable in the amount of disturbance rather than the
   current goal of uniform moderate disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{The breakdown of the transhumant grazing system in the Spanish Pyrenees
   has led to a severe decline in the area of pastures. However, in the
   high mountain zone there are still large areas of species-rich
   grasslands. The aim of this study was to assess the oviposition
   preferences of the shrub-feeding Blue-spot hairstreak Satyrium spini
   (Denis \& Schiffermuller, 1775), in montane common pastures in the
   Spanish Pyrenees and recommend a way of managing these grasslands that
   favours this species. Our study showed that females of S. spini laid
   their eggs on Dwarf buckthorn (Rhamnus pumila Turra) and Alpine
   buckthorn (R. alpina L.), which are novel host plant records for Spain.
   A warm microclimate was of crucial importance for egg-laying. Occupied
   plants grew mostly at sparsely vegetated grassland sites where there
   were large patches of bare rocks, stones or gravel. Most egg batches
   were laid close to the ground and 75\% consisted of only one egg. The
   number of batches per R. pumila plant was higher on east-, south-and
   west-facing slopes than on north-facing slopes. Presence of eggs and the
   number of egg batches per R. pumila plant were best explained by a long
   sunshine duration. At high altitudes particularly warm microhabitats
   seem to be more important for S. spini than at lower altitudes in
   Central Europe. We assume that the preference for unusually warm
   microhabitats is explained by the cold climatic conditions near the
   altitudinal range limit of the species. That most of the eggs were laid
   singly and not in small batches as in Central Europe might be a
   risk-spreading strategy to cope with the harsh climatic conditions and
   the high inter-annual variation in weather conditions in the high
   mountain zone in the Pyrenees. The best way to maintain open grasslands
   for S. spini and other thermophilous grassland species in the high
   mountain zone of the Pyrenees is to use the traditional combination of
   sheep and cattle grazing.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examines how the habitat type and food availability
   influence the small scale distribution and assemblages of opisthobranch
   species in the National Park Arrecife Alacranes, the largest coral reef
   system in the southern Gulf of Mexico. Samples were collected during
   December 2009, and April and September 2010 over different habitats
   (green, red, and brown algae, seagrass meadows, drifting Sargassum spp.,
   rocks, corals, and sand). In total, 32 species were identified and a
   multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis based on the Bray-Curtis
   similarity index was used to determine the main opisthobranch
   assemblages. The degree of association between the habitat type and the
   species composition was tested by a chi-square test and the significance
   of its value was determined by Monte Carlo randomizations. MDS results
   defined four faunal associations ({''}algal,{''} ``Thalassia,{''}
   ``Sargassum,{''} and ``rocky{''} assemblages), which showed a
   significant relationship between the composition of opisthobranch
   species and the habitat type. These results suggest that food supplies
   and feeding strategies play a dominant role in the coexistence of
   species and their small-scale spatial distribution within the reef. The
   algal assemblage, the group with the highest species richness, was
   mainly composed of herbivores inhabiting several types of benthic algal
   communities, whereas the Sargassum assemblage, was a less diversified
   group comprised of carnivores feeding on epibiont hydroids and was well
   adapted to the pelagic environment. The distribution of the
   opisthobranchs over the different habitats largely reflected the variety
   and availability of their food items.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing semi-natural grasslands may enhance their wildlife faunal
   diversity and abundance by modifying the plant species composition
   through exploiting the dietary choices of the domestic livestock, yet
   diet preferences in these grasslands are often poorly understood. We
   therefore investigated diet selection of beef cattle in semi-natural
   pastures, grazed at moderate stocking (MS) or lenient stocking (LS),
   using the global positioning system (GPS) to track their foraging paths.
   This was combined with use of an automatic system to record foraging
   behaviour in free-ranging ruminants and measurements of vegetation
   structure (pasture height and plant functional groups) at a given
   location. The diet selected by each animal at each grazing location was
   then determined from a vegetation map surveyed using GPS along with a
   geographical information system (GIS). Patches containing clover
   comprised only 17.5\% and 3.1\% cover in the MS and LS swards,
   respectively. Clover was also mostly distributed in the sward as
   singular patches, rather than as larger aggregated clumps and it
   appeared that these species were not as strongly selected as has been
   reported for less heterogeneous pastures where they are more prevalent.
   This study demonstrated that GPS tracking of livestock foraging paths
   could be combined with vegetation mapping and automatic grazing
   behaviour measurements to investigate diet preference in complex,
   heterogeneous swards. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The High Mountains of Crdoba, Argentina have a long evolutionary history
   of grazing by large herbivores. However, about 400 years ago, European
   livestock were introduced and gradually replaced native herbivores.
   Since the 1920s, domestic herbivores have been the only large herbivores
   present in the area, causing severe soil erosion and a threat to the
   system diversity. The endemic fauna of the region includes four
   amphibian species. We evaluated the effect of livestock rearing on
   amphibian diversity and water bodies in woodlands and grasslands of the
   High Mountains of Crdoba. The work was conducted on stream stretches and
   ponds in two contrasting grazing situations: an area with livestock
   presence and another area where livestock was excluded 14 years ago. The
   following variables were recorded at each sampling site: amphibian
   richness and abundance, percentage of emergent, submerged and peripheral
   vegetation in areas surrounding the water bodies, water pH, and water
   dissolved O-2. No significant differences were detected in amphibian
   diversity between streams of both grazing situations, whereas a greater
   diversity (p < 0.01) was observed in ponds in grazed grasslands. Our
   results suggest that livestock rearing, qualitatively measured as
   grazing and 14 years of livestock exclusion, in the study area would not
   have negative effects on amphibian diversity. This finding might be due
   to the long evolutionary grazing history of the area, large-scale
   livestock exclusion exhibiting a novel scenario. The ongoing
   reintroduction of native grazers may provide the benefits of grazing
   without the consequent soil erosion and habitat degradation associated
   with domestic livestock.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between adjacent trophic levels are essential for
   ecosystem functioning and stability. Grazing by domestic herbivores is
   an essential interaction in grasslands, but little information is
   available on the nature of relationship between plant and insect
   diversity under grazing by large herbivores. We examined the effects of
   large herbivores on the relationship between plant and insect diversity
   with five grazing treatments (control, cattle, goat, sheep and a mixture
   of the three grazing types) across three plant diversity levels (low: 45
   species, intermediate: 89 species and high: 1517 species) in a meadow
   steppe. We found that the grazing treatments did not significantly
   affect plant species richness, but reduced plant biomass, plant height
   and cover. Grazers affected variation in plant height differently at
   different plant diversity levels, and this variation increased at the
   low plant diversity level and decreased at the high plant diversity
   level after grazing. A similar pattern was observed for insect species
   richness: grazing had a positive impact at the low plant diversity
   level, but had a negative impact at the high plant diversity level. In
   the absence of grazing, insect species richness was positively
   associated with plant species richness, but it decreased with increasing
   plant diversity in the grazing treatments. This was attributed to strong
   responses of insect species richness to plant height heterogeneity under
   grazing by large herbivores, implying that plant structural
   heterogeneity is more important than plant diversity in influencing
   insect diversity in grazed grasslands. Synthesis and applications.
   Grazing by large herbivores may reverse the positive relationship
   between plant diversity and insect diversity by modifying plant
   structural heterogeneity. Therefore, the spatial heterogeneity of
   vegetation structure should be given more attention in future work on
   plantinsect interactions. This study further highlights the importance
   of using large herbivore grazing in management actions, not only to
   maintain diversity but also to mediate trophic interactions in
   grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in livestock grazing regimes are among the most important
   drivers of species loss and decrease in functional diversity world-wide.
   However, taxonomic and functional diversities (TD and FD) can respond
   differently to changes in grazing regime or productivity. We surveyed
   plant communities from 67 sites under different grazing regimes (from
   heavy grazing to grazing abandonment) in wet and dry habitats, in both
   wet and dry years. We tested the influence of grazing intensity, habitat
   type and rainfall on TD, FD and the relationship between them. We also
   partitioned diversity to examine the effects of grazing on TD and FD
   across scales (within communities, within grazing levels and between
   grazing levels). The effect of grazing within and across communities was
   modulated by water availability, with grazing showing the strongest
   effects in dry habitats. The relationship between FD and TD varied
   between habitat types and years and revealed high functional similarity
   between species (i.e. redundancy) in dry habitats. TD was reduced in the
   driest conditions across all the observation levels, contrasting with
   the high temporal stability of FD, suggesting that FD was decoupled from
   TD, especially in dry habitats. However, despite the high temporal and
   spatial stability of FD, results show that under severely limited water
   availability, high grazing pressure can reduce FD, revealing a
   convergence in traits under the combined effect of grazing and drought
   conditions. Synthesis and applications. Results highlight the dependence
   of functional diversity on the combined effect of water availability and
   grazing regime. Under severely limited water availability, grazing
   intensification reduced the functional diversity of these grasslands.
   Because of the foreseeable reduction in water availability in
   Mediterranean environments, we recommend the adoption of flexible
   grazing management schemes that take species and functional diversities
   into account simultaneously and adapt the level of grazing pressure to
   water availability.}},

Abstract = {{Question To what extent does the movement of animals between fragmented
   habitat patches provide functional connectivity via endozoochorous seed
   dispersal? Location The Stockholm archipelago, Sweden. Methods We
   followed all movements of livestock between islands during one grazing
   season. After each movement, manure was collected and its seed content
   assessed through seedling emergence. Seedling data were then compared to
   vegetation surveys from the grazed islands with regard to functional
   traits. Results Light- and nitrogen-demanding locally abundant species,
   and those with relatively small and persistent seeds were more likely to
   be moved between islands. For quantitative traits, only a subset of the
   available trait ranges were dispersed, with extreme values left behind.
   Species apparently specialized to other means of dispersal emerged from
   the manure samples. Neither dispersed traits nor seed density changed
   with timing of movement, but seed richness and diversity both increased
   throughout the season. The subsets of endozoochorously-dispersed species
   in the established vegetation were more similar than non-dispersed
   subsets between islands linked by livestock. Conclusions Grazing
   networks contribute to the connectivity of the core species in the
   system, and could provide useful tools for grassland management in
   fragmented landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Although reserves of temperate seminatural grassland require management
   interventions to prevent succesional change, each intervention affects
   the populations of sensitive organisms, including insects. Therefore, it
   appears as a wise bet-hedging strategy to manage reserves in diverse and
   patchy manners. Using portable light traps, we surveyed the effects of
   two contrasting management options, mowing and temporary abandonment,
   applied in a humid grassland reserve in a submountain area of the Czech
   Republic. Besides of Macrolepidoptera, we also surveyed
   Microlepidoptera, small moths rarely considered in community studies.
   Numbers of individiuals and species were similar in the two treatments,
   but ordionation analyses showed that catches originating from these two
   treatments differed in species composition, management alone explaining
   ca 30 per cent of variation both for all moths and if split to
   Marcolepidoptera and Microlepidoptera. Whereas a majority of
   macrolepidopteran humid grassland specialists preferred unmown sections
   or displayed no association with management, microlepidopteran humid
   grassland specialists contained equal representation of species
   inclining towards mown and unmown sections. We thus revealed that even
   mown section may host valuable species; an observation which would not
   have been detected had we considered Macrolepidoptera only. Our results
   highlight the necessity of diversified management, including temporary
   abandonment, to conserve the biodiversity of grassland reserves and
   grasslands in general.}},

Abstract = {{Questions How does horse or sheep grazing affect species richness,
   diversity and functional composition of plant communities in
   sub-Mediterranean grasslands? What are the implications of grazing
   management for species conservation? Location Pastures dominated by
   Bromus erectus grazed by either sheep or horses in the Umbria-Marches
   Apennines (central Italy). Methods We examined grasslands at altitudes
   ranging from 1000 to 1200 m a.s.l. on north-facing slopes and with a
   slope angle of 20-40 degrees. In 20 plots of 1 m2 for each management
   type, canopy height and above-ground phytomass were recorded. In 120
   plots (60 for each management type) of 1 m2 the cover value of each
   species was recorded. Floristic diversity and community similarity of
   the sheep- and horse-grazed conditions were compared. Functional plant
   traits and strategies or ecological requirements were also evaluated.
   Results The sward was shorter and supported less above-ground phytomass
   in the horse-grazed area. The sheep- and horse-grazed areas had similar
   floristic diversity. Accidental species were the species most affected.
   Plants with low-nutrient requirement spread in horse-grazed pasture.
   Functional traits of species were filtered by the system, resulting in
   diverse cover values of species. Horse grazing promoted plants with a
   robust defence strategy (avoidance and tolerance) that ensured leaves
   were replaced when horses were not grazing, as well as species with
   clonal growth. In the sheep-grazed area, a higher level of selective
   defoliation and a delayed start to the grazing period promoted species
   with low palatability, a late-flowering strategy and those intolerant to
   trampling by large herbivores (chamaephytes). The value of forage feed
   was slightly higher in horse-grazed pasture. Grazing of horses was more
   effective than that of sheep for controlling dominant unpalatable tall
   grasses. Conclusion In terms of biodiversity conservation, horse grazing
   may be considered as useful as sheep grazing, but only if managed at
   optimal stocking rates, because the increase in short grasses and
   annuals (growth forms with poor root systems) does not ensure
   maintenance of soil on steep slopes.}},

Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Many grassland ecosystems are disturbance-dependent, having evolved
   under the pressures of fire and grazing. Restoring these disturbances
   can be controversial, particularly when valued resources are thought to
   be disturbance-sensitive. We tested the effects of fire and grazing on
   butterfly species richness and population density in an economically
   productive grassland landscape of the central U.S. Three management
   treatments were applied: (1) patch-burn graze-rotational burning of
   three spatially distinct patches within a pasture, and
   moderately-stocked cattle grazing (N = 5); (2) graze-and-burn-burning
   entire pasture every 3 years, and moderately-stocked cattle grazing (N =
   4); and (3) burn-only-burning entire pasture every 3 years, but no
   cattle grazing (N = 4). Butterfly abundance was sampled using line
   transect distance sampling in 2008 and 2009, with six 100-m transects
   per pasture. Butterfly species richness did not respond to management
   treatment, but was positively associated with pre-treatment proportion
   of native plant cover. Population density of two prairie specialists
   (Cercyonis pegala and Speyeria idalia) and one habitat generalist
   (Danaus plexippus) was highest in the burn-only treatment, whereas
   density of one habitat generalist (Cupido comyntas) was highest in the
   patch-burn graze treatment. Treatment application affected habitat
   structural characteristics including vegetation height and cover of bare
   ground. Historic land uses have reduced native plant cover and permitted
   exotic plant invasion; for some butterfly species, these legacies had a
   greater influence than management treatments on butterfly density.
   Conservation of native insect communities in altered grasslands might
   require native plant restoration in addition to restoration of
   disturbance processes.}},

Abstract = {{We assessed components of woody plant diversity within and between 16
   sites dispersed across the nearly 200,000 ha of the Semi-arid Chaco
   vegetation of the Copo Conservation Unit, northern Argentina.
   Argentina's Semi-arid Chaco is an object of international conservation
   concern, as it is under pressure from conversion to agroindustry
   supplanting long-standing practices of logging and livestock grazing. We
   recorded from 16 (shrubby grassland following forest fire) to 27
   (selectively logged forest) woody plant species per site and 37 species
   in total (gamma diversity). Additive partitioning showed that alpha
   diversity contributed 59\% to gamma diversity and beta diversity only
   41\%. A separate additive partitioning of gamma diversity of the 13
   forested sites alone showed that beta diversity attributable to logging
   history was considerably lower than remaining beta diversity and alpha
   diversity. Ordination analyses confirmed this finding: species
   composition of unlogged, selectively logged and intensively logged
   forest sites was quite similar. Results suggest that (1) woody
   vegetation, at least, of the Semi-arid Chaco is quite tolerant to
   traditional modes of land use and that (2) conservation of this
   vegetation as a whole must include not only ``pristine{''} sites varying
   in edaphic conditions but also sites varying in land use and management
   histories. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   explain species coexistence in an alpine meadow community after release

Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},

Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Plant species and functional groups in nitrogen (N) limited communities
   may coexist through strong eco-physiological niche differentiation,
   leading to idiosyncratic responses to multiple nutrition and disturbance
   regimes. Very little is known about how such responses depend on the
   availability of N in different chemical forms. Here we hypothesize that
   idiosyncratic year-to-year responses of plant functional groups to
   availability and form of nitrogen explain species coexistence in an
   alpine meadow community after release from grazing. We conducted a 6year
   N addition experiment in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau
   released from grazing by livestock. The experimental design featured
   three N forms (ammonium, nitrate, and ammonium nitrate), crossed with
   three levels of N supply rates (0.375, 1.500 and 7.500gNm-2yr-1), with
   unfertilized treatments without and with light grazing as controls. All
   treatments showed increasing productivity and decreasing species
   richness after cessation of grazing and these responses were stronger at
   higher N rates. Although N forms did not affect aboveground biomass at
   community level, different functional groups did show different
   responses to N chemical form and supply rate and these responses varied
   from year to year. In support of our hypothesis, these idiosyncratic
   responses seemed to enable a substantial diversity and biomass of
   sedges, forbs, and legumes to still coexist with the increasingly
   productive grasses in the absence of grazing, at least at low and
   intermediate N availability regimes. This study provides direct
   field-based evidence in support of the hypothesis that idiosyncratic and
   annually varying responses to both N quantity and quality may be a key
   driver of community structure and species coexistence. This finding has
   important implications for the diversity and functioning of other
   ecosystems with spatial and temporal variation in available N quantity
   and quality as related to changing atmospheric N deposition, land-use,
   and climate-induced soil warming.}},

Abstract = {{Questions Is the species composition of the forest community in
   abandoned pastures different from that in ancient ungrazed forests? Do
   abandoned wooded pastures serve as refugia for forest species? Which
   factors influence forest species communities and the diversity of
   pastures more than 50 similar to years after abandonment? Location
   Doupovske hory, Czech Republic. Methods The species composition of the
   forest plant community was assessed in 90 plots located in abandoned
   pastures with different continuities of woody vegetation. The abandoned
   pastures were compared to 111 other plots located in ancient ungrazed
   forest. The effects of forest continuity, isolation, pH, canopy cover
   and terrain were analysed using CCA and GLMs. Results The forest species
   communities in abandoned pastures differ from those in ancient ungrazed
   forests. The number of forest species in abandoned pastures was
   relatively high. However, abandoned pastures lack some species
   considered as indicators of ancient forests in Europe. The abandoned
   wooded pastures and more recently overgrown pastures generally lacked
   the same set of species in comparison to ancient forests. Additionally,
   we found no regular association of ancient forest indicators with wooded
   pastures compared to more recently overgrown pastures. The forest
   species communities in abandoned pastures are significantly influenced
   by continuity, soil pH (KCl) and habitat isolation. Forest species
   richness depends on continuity (with significantly more species in the
   abandoned wooded pastures than in most recently overgrown pastures).
   Furthermore, species richness is negatively correlated with habitat
   isolation particularly under the open canopy. Conclusions Abandoned
   pastures and wooded pastures offer suitable habitats for forest species.
   However, these forest communities remained unsaturated after more than a
   half-century of succession. Surprisingly, pastures with a long
   continuity in woody cover (wooded pastures) were not better refugia for
   forest species than more recently overgrown pastures. The importance of
   habitat isolation, soil pH and light conditions for forest species
   community composition and richness was confirmed.}},

Title = {{Estimating Coextinction Risks from Epidemic Tree Death: Affiliate Lichen
   Communities among Diseased Host Tree Populations of Fraxinus excelsior}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{At least 10\% of the world's tree species are threatened with extinction
   and pathogens are increasingly implicated in tree threats. Coextinction
   and threats to affiliates as a consequence of the loss or decline of
   their host trees is a poorly understood phenomenon. Ash dieback is an
   emerging infectious disease causing severe dieback of common ash
   Fraxinus excelsior throughout Europe. We utilized available empirical
   data on affiliate epiphytic lichen diversity (174 species and 17,800
   observations) among 20 ash dieback infected host tree populations of F.
   excelsior on the island Gotland in the Baltic Sea, Sweden. From this, we
   used structured scenario projections scaled with empirical data of ash
   dieback disease to generate probabilistic models for estimating local
   and regional lichen coextinction risks. Average coextinction
   probabilities ((A) over bar) were 0.38 (95\% CI +/- 0.09) for lichens
   occurring on F. excelsior and 0.14 (95\% CI +/- 0.03) when considering
   lichen persistence on all tree species. (A) over bar was strongly linked
   to local disease incidence levels and generally increasing with lichen
   host specificity to F. excelsior and decreasing population size.
   Coextinctions reduced affiliate community viability, with significant
   local reductions in species richness and shifts in lichen species
   composition. Affiliates were projected to become locally extirpated
   before their hosts, illuminating the need to also consider host tree
   declines. Traditionally managed open wooded meadows had the highest
   incidence of ash dieback disease and significantly higher proportions of
   affiliate species projected to go extinct, compared with unmanaged
   closed forests and semi-open grazed sites. Most cothreatened species
   were not previously red-listed, which suggest that tree epidemics cause
   many unforeseen threats to species. Our analysis shows that epidemic
   tree deaths represent an insidious, mostly overlooked, threat to sessile
   affiliate communities in forested environments. Current conservation and
   management strategies must account for secondary extinctions associated
   with epidemic tree death.}},

Abstract = {{This study assessed the benefits of sown grass strips on grasshopper
   communities in intensive farmland, and the effects of farming practices
   and landscape context. Results showed that sown grass strips were high
   quality habitats for grasshoppers compared to grasslands. Farming
   practices influenced grasshopper densities in sown grass strips while
   landscape context affected more the species richness of grasshoppers.
   Sown mixture and cutting export option were the main factors driving
   grasshopper density. Mixtures composed of grasses without legumes were
   the best, as well as hay export compared to no export. Increased
   grasshopper species richness occurred in sown grass strips located in
   landscapes with low grassland field availability and high connectivity.
   Enhanced use of sown grass strips by grasshoppers can be seen as a
   direct effect of establishment and management options, but also as an
   effect of the rarity and instability of other grassland habitats in
   agricultural landscapes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Impact of grazing on the floristic diversity of arid rangelands in South
   Tunisia. If the effects of grazing on plant diversity have been
   extensively studied in a wide range of ecosystems, effects of controlled
   grazing are still largely unknown. Species diversity indices are useful
   indicators of the sustainability of collective rangelands in southern
   Tunisia. In order to determine an optimal management method of arid
   rangelands with high heritage value, we examined the respective effects
   of continuous grazing, moderate grazing and rest on the plant
   community's diversity. We compared diversity indices of the vegetation
   for three levels of grazing pressure (null, moderate and heavy) in the
   collective rangelands dominated by Gymnocarpos decander, Hammada
   schmittiana, Stipagrostis pungens and Anthyllis sericea of Dhahars in
   the south-eastern region of Tataouine (Tunisia). Species richness and
   Simpson's diversity tended to decrease with increased grazing pressure,
   but the difference was not significant between ungrazed and moderately
   grazed rangelands. By contrast, species evenness tended to increase with
   grazing pressure. Diversity and vegetation biological spectrum were only
   slightly affected by controlled grazing. This study demonstrates the
   value of this management practice for biodiversity conservation.}},

Abstract = {{The grassland is an important component of terrestrial ecosystems and

   present study, the changes of plant species diversity and aboveground
   biomass productivity were examined along with the altitude in natural
   alpine grassland in the source region of three rivers on the
   Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Eleven experimental locations were selected
   with altitudes ranging from 3862 to 4450 m above sea level (a.s.l.). The
   results indicated that Kobresia pygmaea meadow, Kobresia humilis meadow
   and Salix cupularis shrub meadow had higher indices of diversity and
   aboveground biomass. The distribution of species diversity, richness and
   aboveground biomass showed similarly unimodal patterns across the
   altitude gradient with the highest indices appeared at mid-altitudes
   locations. The changing trend of species diversity, richness and
   evenness also showed significant unimodal patterns with total
   aboveground biomass, and the highest species diversity occurred at
   intermediate level of productivities. This research would provide a

Title = {{The interplay of stress and mowing disturbance for the intensity and

Journal = {{ANNALS OF BOTANY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{821-828}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{There is still debate regarding the direction and strength of plant
   interactions under intermediate to high levels of stress. Furthermore,
   little is known on how disturbance may interact with physical stress in
   unproductive environments, although recent theory and models have shown
   that this interplay may induce a collapse of plant interactions and
   diversity. The few studies assessing such questions have considered the
   intensity of biotic interactions but not their importance, although this
   latter concept has been shown to be very useful for understanding the
   role of interactions in plant communities. The objective of this study
   was to assess the interplay between stress and disturbance for plant
   interactions in dry calcareous grasslands.
   A field experiment was set up in the Dordogne, southern France, where
   the importance and intensity of biotic interactions undergone by four
   species were measured along a water stress gradient, and with and
   without mowing disturbance.
   The importance and intensity of interactions varied in a very similar
   way along treatments. Under undisturbed conditions, plant interactions
   switched from competition to neutral with increasing water stress for
   three of the four species, whereas the fourth species was not subject to
   any significant biotic interaction along the gradient. Responses to
   disturbance were more species-specific; for two species, competition
   disappeared with mowing in the wettest conditions, whereas for the two
   other species, competition switched to facilitation with mowing.
   Finally, there were no significant interactions for any species in the
   disturbed and driest conditions.
   At very high levels of stress, plant performances become too weak to
   allow either competition or facilitation and disturbance may accelerate
   the collapse of interactions in dry conditions. The results suggest that
   the importance and direction of interactions are more likely to be
   positively related in stressful environments.}},

Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Wide-spread fragmentation and isolation of habitats with high nature
   conservation value lends increasing importance to a better understanding
   of the factors which determine species richness in isolated habitat
   patches. Using data of one of the most abundant invertebrate groups in
   grasslands, Orthoptera, we analysed how species richness and
   distribution in 60 isolated semi-natural grassland remnants in Austria
   were affected by five environmental variables (altitude, habitat and
   land use diversity within each patch, habitat diversity of areas
   adjacent to each patch, patch size), and related to diversity of their
   main food source, i.e. vascular plants. We found a significant positive
   correlation between Orthoptera and vascular plant species richness, with
   threatened Orthoptera species having the lowest correlation
   coefficients. Life form diversity of plants was only moderately
   positively correlated with Orthoptera species richness. Habitat
   diversity within and adjacent to the grassland patch had by far the
   highest loadings on the first two axes of the principal component
   analysis, which jointly explained 99 \% of the variance, and proved to
   be significant for total, threatened and not threatened Orthoptera, as
   well as for the two Orthoptera orders occurring in Central Europe
   (Caelifera, Ensifera). Additionally, the distribution of the majority of
   those 14 Orthoptera species analysed individually was mainly correlated
   with habitat diversity within and adjacent to the grassland patch.
   However, the distribution of a significant proportion of species was
   associated with other factors: five species were closely related to
   on-site land use diversity and patch size, and the distribution of three
   Ensifera species was not significantly correlated to any of the
   explanatory variables. We conclude that a surrogate taxa approach, i.e.
   the use of well-known taxonomic groups (e.g. vascular plants), may
   indeed deliver good results for capturing total, but less so for
   threatened, Orthoptera species richness in semi-natural grassland
   remnants. Small scale habitat diversity may be crucial to allow for the
   co-existence of a large number of Orthoptera species and has to be taken
   equally into account as patch size in nature conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Mediterranean oak woodlands serve as working landscapes and biodiversity
   hotspots. These landscapes have undergone dramatic land conversion,
   which continues to threaten their conservation. Shifting focus from
   traditional management practices to a balance of conservation and
   production goals is a key challenge on working landscapes, and
   evaluating potential tradeoffs and synergies among goals will be a
   critical first step. California's oak woodlands have undergone marked
   transformations via removal of Quercus douglasii and other woody plants
   to enhance forage production. Within the annual grass-dominated matrix,
   Q. douglasii likely functions as a foundation species-providing
   potential habitat for native plants, such as Nassella pulchra. Via a
   cross-sectional survey, we examined spatial occurrence of N. pulchra
   relative to Q. douglasii trees across three cattle-grazed fields, which
   had previously undergone vegetation manipulation. We hypothesized that
   Q. douglasii trees provide spatial niches for N. pulchra, with
   bunchgrass densities declining with greater distances from Q. douglasii
   stems. Plots (n = 712) were located along northern/southern transects of
   89 trees. N. pulchra densities and site characteristics were surveyed in
   2002 and 2005. Generalized linear mixed model regression analysis
   revealed a significant plot position by community type interaction: N.
   pulchra densities significantly declined with increasing distance from
   target trees at grassland sites; this trend was apparent at savanna
   sites and no trend was observed at woodland sites, which were likely
   under the influence of neighboring trees. Information on native species
   relationships can be utilized by managers to balance agricultural
   production and native species conservation goals across working
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{The changes in agricultural practices during the last century have led
   to a drastic decrease in the number of traditionally managed hay
   meadows. Also, traditional management practices are often applied more
   cursorily in the remaining meadows. In combination with an increase in
   aerial anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, this has led to a loss of
   biodiversity. To investigate whether the current management is
   sufficient for maintaining viable populations of a typical meadow plant,
   Succisa pratensis, we experimentally reinforced the raking and mowing
   parts of the traditional management over four years in a two-by-two
   factorial experiment in three traditionally managed wooded hay meadows
   on the Baltic island of Gotland, Sweden. We found decreased litter and
   hay production in two of the three studied meadows as a result of our
   treatments. Plant sizes and asymptotic population growth rates (lambda)
   of S. pratensis increased, particularly in plots receiving the combined
   raking and mowing treatment. Stochastic long-term population growth
   rates (lambda (s) ) increased under the reinforced management: projected
   population sizes 50 years into the future showed a three-fold increase
   in raked plots and a 17-fold increase in plots that were both raked and
   mown. Because we found positive responses even in these seemingly
   well-managed meadows we conclude that it is essential that management is
   carried out more thoroughly to ensure viable population sizes. Our
   conclusion applies to most semi-natural grasslands receiving
   anthropogenic nitrogen, or where traditional management practices are
   less rigorously applied. We also suggest using biomass estimation
   instead of vegetation height as a measure of management strength.}},

Abstract = {{Aim We investigated how current and historical land use and landscape
   structure affect species richness and the processes of extinction,
   immigration and species turnover. Location The northern part of the
   Stockholm archipelago, Baltic Sea, Sweden. We resurveyed 27 islands
   ranging from 0.3 to 33 ha in area. Methods We compared current plant
   survey data, cadastral maps and aerial photographs with records obtained
   from a survey in 1908, using databases and a digital elevation model to
   examine changes in plant community dynamics in space and time. We
   examined the effects of local and landscape structure and land use
   changes on plant species dynamics by using stepwise regression in
   relation to eight local and three landscape variables. The eight local
   variables were area, relative age, shape, soil heterogeneity, bedrock
   ratio, number of houses, forest cover change, and grazing 100 years ago.
   The three landscape variables were distance to mainland, distance to
   closest island with a farm 100 years ago, and structural connectivity.
   Hanskis connectivity measure was modified to incorporate both
   connectivity and fragmentation. Results The investigated islands have
   undergone drastic changes, with increasing forest cover, habitation, and
   abandonment of grassland management. Although the total species richness
   increased by 31\% and mean island area by 23\%, we found no significant
   increase in species richness per unit area. Local variables explain past
   species richness (100 years ago), whereas both local and landscape
   variables explain current species richness, extinctions, immigrations
   and species turnover. Grazing that occurred 100 years ago still
   influences species richness, even though grazing management was
   abandoned several decades ago. The evidence clearly shows an increase in
   nitrophilous plant species, particularly among immigrant species. Main
   conclusions This study highlights the importance of including land use
   history when interpreting current patterns of species richness.
   Furthermore, local environment and landscape patterns affect important
   ecological processes such as immigration, extinction and species
   turnover, and hence should be included when assessing the impact of
   habitat fragmentation and land use change. We suggest that our modified
   structural connectivity measure can be applied to other types of
   landscapes to investigate the effects of fragmentation and habitat loss.}},

Abstract = {{1. Theoretical models show that environmental heterogeneity and
   dispersal are major determinants of species diversity at multiple
   scales, yet there are few studies from real landscapes that adequately
   integrate variation in the surrounding matrix. Understanding how
   landscape context and management influence species composition and
   diversity patterns across habitats and scales is an important goal in
   ecology with relevance for both management and conservation. 2. We used
   a system of 25 landscapes distributed across islands in the Baltic Sea
   to investigate the effect of current and historical landscape context
   and management on plant diversity and composition in grassland
   communities. Plant diversity was measured at three hierarchical scales
   (1 m2, habitat, landscape) in grazed fields and adjacent wood pastures
   to calculate a-, beta- and ?-diversity values across habitats and
   scales. 3. Structural equation modelling was used to model and quantify
   the effects of landscape context on species diversity and spatial
   turnover, and constraint analysis of principal coordinates to relate
   variation in species composition to landscape variables. 4. Proportion
   of open land, spacing and grazing intensity positively affected species
   diversity in both habitats, whereas the effect of historical landscape
   context was only significant in open fields. Plant diversity in field
   pastures was mainly determined by the number of species found at a small
   scale, while both local species density and spatial turnover were key
   determinants of diversity in wood pastures. 5. Habitat proximity
   influenced species composition as compositional similarity was higher
   between adjacent field and wood pastures compared to randomly paired
   habitats. Although increasing flow of propagules from adjacent patches
   can promote local coexistence, dispersal can result in spatial
   homogenization. 6. Synthesis. Plant diversity in grassland communities
   is substantially influenced by species occurring in adjacent habitats.
   While the effect of landscape context and management on small-scale
   diversity was consistent across habitats, the effect on spatial turnover
   was habitat specific. Our study shows that plant diversity is structured
   through the interplay between local and landscape processes and
   highlights that plant communities in specific habitat types cannot be
   considered in isolation from the surrounding landscape matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Forage services provided by permanent grassland: grass production and
   feeding value for ruminants
   Permanent grassland represents 50 \% of feed resources for herbivorous
   livestock. The decreasing area of permanent grassland is tied to the non
   recognition of its forage value. Forage services provided by grassland
   depend on seasonal dynamics and the quality of grass production. The
   forage potential of permanent grassland (production and feeding value)
   can in certain cases equal that of sown grassland. Forage potential
   varies depending on the functional composition of vegetation. Different
   types of grassland have been defined in this way, on a regional and
   national scale, based on vegetation descriptors. Despite certain
   `shortcomings' (lower productivity, difficult environment), permanent
   grassland is now recognized for the forage services it provides on a
   small and larger scale (field, farm, landscape). Grassland diversity
   also contributes to sustaining grassland-based systems.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic nutrient enrichment increases the supply ratio of N and P
   to aquatic ecosystems and can affect the identity of the limiting
   nutrient. Here we focus on how stream communities change along gradients
   of N and P supply and stream catchment landuse intensity. We used a
   survey approach in 41 southern New Zealand tributaries to investigate
   how much changes in water N and P concentrations are reflected in
   periphyton C:nutrient ratios (C:N or C:P) and how much food quality
   (high food quality corresponds to low periphyton C:nutrient) is
   reflected in the abundance and taxonomic richness of benthic
   invertebrate primary and secondary consumers. We measured streamwater
   nutrient state, periphyton nutrient ratios, biomass (as chlorophyll a in
   mu g/cm(2)), algal taxon richness, and macroinvertebrate abundance,
   taxonomic composition, and richness. We also estimated stream habitat
   and catchment characteristics, such as current velocity, shading,
   substrate, geology, and landuse intensity. We calculated the Akaike
   information criterion (AIC) for each possible multiple linear regression
   model to select the best predictive models for each response variable.
   C:nutrient ratios were more strongly negatively related to water-column
   N than P availability. Neither N nor P availability covaried with
   periphyton biomass. Lower periphyton C:N partly explained higher grazer,
   but not predator, abundance. Increased \% runoff from pasture and
   periphyton N:P co-occurred with a decrease in invertebrate taxon
   richness. For example, a 4x increase in periphyton N:P was related to
   the loss of similar to 1/2 of invertebrate species, but with high
   uncertainty (R-2 = 0.13). We conclude landuse intensity affects these
   southern New Zealand streams, and these effects are mediated by
   agricultural N runoff into streams (among other factors). Further shifts
   toward high-intensity farming within stream catchments may lead to
   losses of benthic species at all trophic levels.}},

Abstract = {{The soil ecosystem is critical for human health, affecting aspects of
   the environment from key agricultural and edaphic parameters to critical
   influence on climate change. Soil has more unknown biodiversity than any
   other ecosystem. We have applied diverse DNA extraction methods coupled
   with high throughput pyrosequencing to explore 4.88 x 10(9) bp of
   metagenomic sequence data from the longest continually studied soil
   environment (Park Grass experiment at Rothamsted Research in the UK).
   Results emphasize important DNA extraction biases and unexpectedly low
   seasonal and vertical soil metagenomic functional class variations.
   Clustering-based subsystems and carbohydrate metabolism had the largest
   quantity of annotated reads assigned although <50\% of reads were
   assigned at an E value cutoff of 10(-5). In addition, with the more
   detailed subsystems, cAMP signaling in bacteria (3.24 +/- 0.27\% of the
   annotated reads) and the Ton and Tol transport systems (1.69 +/- 0.11\%)
   were relatively highly represented. The most highly represented genome
   from the database was that for a Bradyrhizobium species. The metagenomic
   variance created by integrating natural and methodological fluctuations
   represents a global picture of the Rothamsted soil metagenome that can
   be used for specific questions and future inter-environmental
   metagenomic comparisons. However, only 1\% of annotated sequences
   correspond to already sequenced genomes at 96\% similarity and E values
   of <10(-5), thus, considerable genomic reconstructions efforts still
   have to be performed. The ISME Journal (2012) 6, 1677-1687;

Abstract = {{1. aFoliar endophytic fungi in herbaceous plants are known to be
   diverse, yet studies characterizing the fungal communities in roots and
   shoots of plants across time are absent. These fungi are supposedly
   ubiquitous in nature, infecting plants through airborne spores. As many
   foliar endophytes can also exist in soil, we hypothesized that there
   would be a strong similarity between root and shoot endophytes in any
   given plant species and that differences between plant species would be
   greater than those between organs within a species. 2. Leaf and root
   fungal endophyte communities were assessed in field-collected plants of
   three co-occurring grassland forbs (Cirsium arvense, Plantago lanceolata
   and Rumex acetosa) in two contrasting seasons (winter and summer). The
   former two species are mycorrhizal, whilst the latter species is not so.
   3. The highest fungal species richness was recorded from P. lanceolata
   with R. acetosa hosting the least endophyte diversity. Endophyte
   communities were more diverse in root than leaf tissues and in summer
   than in winter. Similarity of endophyte communities between different
   host plant species and organs within an individual host was very low.
   Negative correlations were found between mycorrhizal colonization and
   endophyte presence in the roots of C. arvense and P. lanceolata,
   suggesting some degree of antagonism or competition between the fungi.
   Consistent positive associations were found between the number of
   endophyte species in roots and shoots of plants. 4. Synthesis. In
   contrast to previous studies, the results show that many endophytes do
   not occur ubiquitously, but instead exhibit both plant and tissue
   specificity. There is a strong seasonal change in endophyte communities,
   but the differences between roots and shoots at any one time can be just
   as large. This dissimilarity suggests a lack of systemic growth by the
   fungi from one tissue to another. Mycorrhizas may interact negatively
   with other root endophytes, indicating that the latter should not be
   ignored in future mycorrhizal studies. We should begin to think of
   individual plants as ecosystems of interacting microbes, whose community
   is structured by plant genetics and environmental conditions, coupled
   with interactions between the microbes themselves.}},

Abstract = {{Simplification of natural habitats leads to a modification of the
   community associated with a host plant. Pequi trees (Caryocar
   brasiliense) are common to find in central Brazil, especially in the
   middle of mono-cultures, such as soy, corn, pasturelands or Eucalyptus
   plantations. On this scenario we hypothesized that habitat modification
   differentially affects the diversity of ants and herbivore insects
   associated with this species. The aim of the work was to test if C.
   brasiliense trees located in human modified habitats, support a lower
   species richness and abundance of ants, and a greater species richness
   and abundance of insect herbivores, compared to preserved cerrado
   habitats. The study was conducted in a Cerrado area located in Northern
   Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Ants and herbivore insects were collected
   monthly during 2005 using beating technique. The results showed that ant
   species richness was higher in pequi trees located in preserved Cerrado,
   followed by trees in pastureland and Eucalyptus plantation,
   respectively. The ant abundance was lower in the Eucalyptus plantation
   but no difference in ant abundance was observed between trees in
   pastureland and the preserved Cerrado. Moreover, herbivore insects
   exhibited lower number of species and individuals in trees located in
   the preserved Cerrado than in the pastureland and Eucalyptus plantation.
   We concluded that habitats simplified by human activities may result in
   diversity loss and may change species interactions. Rev. Biol. Trop. 60

Abstract = {{Semi-natural temperate grasslands in Europe make an important
   contribution to biodiversity, but their existence has been endangered by
   both agricultural intensification and abandonment. In the Czech
   Republic, Arrhenatherion meadows are a typical example, with their
   conservation made difficult by the scarcity of research on effective
   management practices. We examined effects of two potentially useful
   approaches, application of 56 kg N ha-1 and earlier first mowing (i.e.
   in the middle of May, about 2 weeks earlier than usual), on species
   composition of an Arrhenatherion grassland in central Bohemia over a
   7-year period (19982004). These treatments did not influence species
   richness, but resulted in small changes in canopy structure in terms of
   cover of individual species and particular plant functional groups. N
   application resulted in increases in nitrophilous species and tall
   graminoids, especially Alopecurus pratensis, Festuca pratensis,
   Heracleum sphondylium and Ranunculus acris, and in decreases in short
   graminoids. Earlier mowing decreased tall herbs, especially H.similar to
   sphondylium, and might thus be useful in compensating for increases in
   some nitrophilous species owing to N application. However, earlier
   mowing had negative impacts on spring-flowering species in terms of
   reduced cover.}},

Title = {{Orthoptera as ecological indicators for succession in steppe grassland}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Pages = {{337-344}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Understanding the effects of land-use on threatened ecosystems is of
   special relevance for nature conservation. The aim of our study was to
   use Orthoptera as ecological indicators for succession in Central
   European steppe grasslands.
   Orthoptera showed a clear response to succession. Each successional
   stage harboured a unique assemblage. Species richness of habitat
   specialists was highest in the earliest seral stages. In contrast,
   density of all species peaked at the intermediate successional stage.
   Early successional stages are mostly likely to be preferred by
   specialized Orthoptera because they provide warm suitable oviposition
   sites (bare ground) and microclimatic conditions. The density peak in
   the mid-successional stage probably reflects a trade-off between
   favourable ambient temperatures for optimal development, sufficient food
   and shelter against predators.
   Although all successional stages of steppe grassland are relevant for
   conservation, early and mid-successional stages are the most important.
   Consequently, conservation management should aim at reintroduction of a
   traditional, low-intensive land use for abandoned steppe grasslands. As
   an optimal land use, we recommend traditional rough grazing with sheep
   and goats, which creates a heterogeneous habitat structure with bare
   ground, and avoids the accumulation of litter, favouring Orthoptera. (C)

Title = {{Nitrogen Addition Regulates Soil Nematode Community Composition through

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 31}},
Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) enrichment resulting from anthropogenic activities has
   greatly changed the composition and functioning of soil communities.
   Nematodes are one of the most abundant and diverse groups of soil
   organisms, and they occupy key trophic positions in the soil detritus
   food web. Nematodes have therefore been proposed as useful indicators
   for shifts in soil ecosystem functioning under N enrichment. Here, we
   monitored temporal dynamics of the soil nematode community using a
   multi-level N addition experiment in an Inner Mongolia grassland.
   Measurements were made three years after the start of the experiment. We
   used structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the mechanisms
   regulating nematode responses to N enrichment. Across the N enrichment
   gradient, significant reductions in total nematode abundance, diversity
   (H' and taxonomic richness), maturity index (MI), and the abundance of
   root herbivores, fungivores and omnivores-predators were found in
   August. Root herbivores recovered in September, contributing to the
   temporal variation of total nematode abundance across the N gradient.
   Bacterivores showed a hump-shaped relationship with N addition rate,
   both in August and September. Ammonium concentration was negatively
   correlated with the abundance of total and herbivorous nematodes in
   August, but not in September. Ammonium suppression explained 61\% of the
   variation in nematode richness and 43\% of the variation in nematode
   trophic group composition. Ammonium toxicity may occur when herbivorous
   nematodes feed on root fluid, providing a possible explanation for the
   negative relationship between herbivorous nematodes and ammonium
   concentration in August. We found a significantly positive relationship
   between fungivores and fungal phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA),
   suggesting bottom-up control of fungivores. No such relationship was
   found between bacterivorous nematodes and bacterial PLFA. Our findings
   contribute to the understanding of effects of N enrichment in semiarid
   grassland on soil nematode trophic groups, and the cascading effects in
   the detrital soil food web.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the species richness and abundance of Drosophila
   Fallen, 1823 attracted to dung and carrion baited pitfall traps in
   natural areas with heterogeneous habitats at the Sierra de Minas,
   Eastern Serranias, southeastern Uruguay. Collecting was carried out on a
   monthly basis (May 2002 through April 2003). Drosophilids accounted for
   0.84\% (n = 131) and 3.61\% (n = 158) of the Diptera collected from dung
   (n = 15,630) and carrion (n = 4,382) pitfall traps, respectively. A
   total of 12 species were identified, 11 of which belong to the subgenus
   Drosophila (the richest) and one to the subgenus Sophophora Sturtevant,
   1939. Over 90\% of the Drosophila specimens collected belong to five
   species of the subgenus Drosophila, namely D. gaucho Jaeger \& Salzano,
   1953, D. immigrans Sturtevant, 1921, D. mediovittata Frota-Pessoa, 1954,
   D. aff. nappae Vilela, Valente \& Basso-da-Silva, 2004, and D.
   ornatifrons Duda, 1927. Drosophila cardini Sturtevant, 1916 is recorded
   for the first time from Uruguay. Drosophila abundance and species
   richness in the four habitats sampled in the Uruguayan Eastern
   Serranias, namely woodlands sierra, riparian forest, pine plantation and
   grazing grassland, were considered to be a function of habitat
   conservation. Diversity indices were low in all habitats. Different
   habitats supported particular coprophilous and necrophilous Drosophila
   species. The woodland sierra represents the most preserved habitat, and
   contributed with the highest species richness observed. Drosophila
   ornatifrons was the dominant species, with a restricted habitat
   distribution. On the other hand, grazed grassland, an environment
   modified by livestock management, had the lowest species richness: only
   a few specimens of D. repleta Wollaston, 1858. Regarding species
   composition, significant differences were found in some pairwise
   comparisons of groups of Drosophila species that included D.
   ornatifrons. Fly attraction to dung can be exploited as an alternative
   and/or complementary collecting method in ecological studies of
   Drosophila assemblages in natural areas.}},

Title = {{Viable seed banks under grazing and exclosure conditions in montane

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{8-15}},

Abstract = {{Grazing by large herbivores affects the composition of established
   vegetation and seed banks. Montane Pampas grasslands are highly
   productive and have evolved with the influence of grazing by native
   herbivores. Thus we proposed, firstly that grazing by feral horses would
   increase seed bank diversity, without changing seed density in grazed
   areas and secondly that there is a greater similarity between the seed
   bank and aboveground vegetation in exclosure areas. The study area is
   located in sub-humid montane grassland in mid-eastern Argentina.
   Sampling took place at the beginning and end of summer in 2008 and 2009,
   in three one-year-old exclosures and grazed areas. Soil and litter
   samples were collected and established vegetation cover was visually
   recorded in every area. Each sample was elutriated and sieved. Seed
   composition was recorded using a dissecting microscope. Seed density and
   species richness of the samples was analyzed using ANOVA and species
   composition was analyzed by multivariate analysis. Grazing reduces the
   seed density and richness of grasses, but forb species are not affected.
   The seed density of grasses increases in soil samples at the end of
   summer, while the density of forb species does not change. Similarity
   between the established vegetation and the seed bank was low. Grazing
   affects seed bank composition which could limit restoration time after
   the removal of herbivores. However, grass seed availability increases
   considerably during a short period after exclosure establishment,
   showing high potential for recovery in sub-humid grasslands. (C) 2012

Journal = {{AUSTRAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{569-582}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The relative effects of tree clearing, increased livestock densities and
   nutrient enrichment have rarely been compared across markedly different
   organism types, but negative effects are generally predicted. In
   contrast, adoption of rotational grazing is thought to benefit
   biodiversity in pastures but there are few supporting data. We examined
   the response of native plants, birds and reptiles to livestock
   management in south-eastern Australia. We selected 12 pairs of
   rotationally and continuously grazed farms. Two 1-ha plots were
   established in native pastures on each farm, one cleared and the second
   still retaining woodland tree cover. Stocking rates, fertilizer
   histories and landscape tree cover varied among farms. The abundance and
   richness of all taxa was lower in cleared pastures. The less mobile
   organisms (reptiles and plants) were positively correlated with tree
   cover at landscape scales, but only when trees were present at the plot
   scale. This pattern was driven by a few observations in landscapes with
   approximately 50\% tree canopy cover. Neither bird abundance nor
   richness was correlated with stocking rates or nutrient enrichment, but
   plant richness responded negatively to both. The response of reptiles
   varied, declining with nutrient enrichment but positively correlated
   with livestock densities. These responses may be partly interpreted
   within the context of prior filtering of species pools through long-term
   grazing pressure. No taxa responded positively to rotational grazing
   management. We predict that reductions in livestock density and soil
   nutrients will directly benefit plants and less so reptiles, but not
   birds. Indirect benefits are predicted for birds and reptiles if
   management increases persistence of trees within paddocks. Although some
   forms of rotational grazing can increase woodland tree recruitment,
   rotational grazing in itself is unlikely to enhance diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the detrimental impacts of invasive plants on native
   biodiversity, ecosystem function, and management cost, few studies have
   focused on the long-term persistence of invaders. Here, we use a unique,
   long-term dataset to examine the recovery of northern rough fescue
   prairie communities, 41 years after the removal of livestock from Riding
   Mountain National Park, Manitoba, Canada. Our 1973 data suggest that
   summer grazing of plains' rough fescue (Festuca hallii (Vasey) Piper)
   leads to its displacement from the plant community and increased
   dominance by exotic invaders. After 41 years of recovery time, historic
   grazing intensity remained an excellent predictor of community structure
   and composition. Areas classified as heavily grazed in 1973 remained
   characterized by exotic grasses and had significantly lower richness and
   diversity. While some exotic invaders persisted despite 41 years of
   community recovery, others were ephemeral. For example, both Poa
   pratensis (L.) and Bromus inermis (Leyss.) persisted, increasing in
   abundance across all classes of grazing intensity, suggesting that their
   control requires active restoration of the invaded areas. In contrast,
   passive restoration may be possible for a subset of ephemeral exotic
   species such as Taraxacum officinale, which had virtually disappeared
   from invaded prairies by 2010. Our long-term data provide a rare
   perspective into the long-term dynamics of plant invasions. Based on our
   findings, conservation managers will need to consider the dichotomy
   between persistent and ephemeral invaders and their impact on the
   recovery of northern prairie communities as they focus their restoration
   efforts against the mounting impacts of exotic plant invaders.}},

Abstract = {{The current terrestrial risk assessment of insecticides regarding
   nontarget arthropods considers exclusively beneficial organisms, whereas
   herbivorous insects, such as grasshoppers, are ignored. However,
   grasshoppers living in field margins or meadows adjacent to crops may
   potentially be exposed to insecticides due to contact with or ingestion
   of contaminated food. Therefore, the present study assessed effects of
   five active ingredients of insecticides (dimethoate, pirimicarb,
   imidacloprid, lambda-cyhalothrin, and deltamethrin) on the survival of
   Chorthippus sp. grasshopper nymphs by considering two routes of exposure
   (contact and oral). The experiments were accompanied by monitoring field
   margins that neighbored cereals, vineyards, and orchards. Grasslands
   were used as reference sites. The laboratory toxicity tests revealed a
   sensitivity of grasshoppers with regard to the insecticides tested in
   the present study similar to that of the standard test species used in
   arthropod risk assessments. In the field monitoring program, increasing
   grasshopper densities were detected with increasing field margin width
   next to cereals and vineyards, but densities remained low over the whole
   range of field margins from 0.5 to 20?m next to orchards. Grasshopper
   densities equivalent to those of grassland sites were only observed in
   field margins exceeding 9?m in width, except for field margins next to
   orchards. These results may indicate that current insecticide risk
   assessments are insufficiently protective for grasshoppers in field

Abstract = {{1. Many rangelands evolved under an interactive disturbance regime in
   which grazers respond to the spatial pattern of fire and create a
   patchy, heterogeneous landscape. Spatially heterogeneous fire and
   grazing create heterogeneity in vegetation structure at the landscape
   level (patch contrast) and increase rangeland biodiversity. We analysed
   five experiments comparing spatially heterogeneous fire treatments to
   spatially homogeneous fire treatments on grazed rangeland along a
   precipitation gradient in the North American Great Plains. 2. We
   predicted that, across the precipitation gradient, management for
   heterogeneity increases both patch contrast and variance in the
   composition of plant functional groups. Furthermore, we predicted that
   patch contrast is positively correlated with variance in plant
   functional group composition. Because fire spread is important to the
   firegrazing interaction, we discuss factors that reduce fire spread and
   reduce patch contrast despite management for heterogeneity. 3. We
   compared patch contrast across pastures managed for heterogeneity and
   pastures managed for homogeneity with a linear mixed effect (LME)
   regression model. We used the LME model to partition variation in
   vegetation structure to each sampled scale so that a higher proportion
   of variation at the patch scale among pastures managed for heterogeneity
   indicates patch contrast. To examine the relationship between vegetation
   structure and plant community composition, we used constrained
   ordination to measure variation in functional group composition along
   the vegetation structure gradient. We used the meta-analytical
   statistic, Cohens d, to compare effect sizes for patch contrast and
   plant functional group composition. 4. Management for heterogeneity
   increased patch contrast and increased the range of plant functional
   group composition at three of the five experimental locations. 5. Plant
   functional group composition varied in proportion to the amount of
   spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure on pastures managed for
   heterogeneity. 6. Synthesis and applications. Pyric-herbivory management
   for heterogeneity created patch contrast in vegetation across a broad
   range of precipitation and plant community types, provided that fire was
   the primary driver of grazer site selection. Management for
   heterogeneity did not universally create patch contrast. Stocking rate
   and invasive plant species are key regulators of heterogeneity, as they
   determine the influence of fire on the spatial pattern of fuel,
   vegetation structure and herbivore patch selection, and therefore also
   require careful management.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Water and nutrient availability are major limits to productivity in
   semi-arid ecosystems; hence, ecological restoration often focuses on
   conserving or concentrating soil resources. By contrast, nutrient
   enrichment can promote invasion by exotic annuals, leading to
   restoration approaches that target reduction of soil nutrients. We aimed
   to explore potential biodiversity trade-offs between these approaches by
   investigating relationships among soil nutrients, exotic annuals and
   native plant diversity and composition. In particular, we investigated
   the hypothesis that native plant diversity in semi-arid to temperate
   woodlands reflects the productivitydiversity hypothesis, leading to
   hump-backed relationships with soil nutrients such that (1) native plant
   diversity declines with increasing nutrient enrichment and (2) native
   diversity is limited at the lowest levels of soil fertility. Location
   Fragmented, long-ungrazed Eucalyptus loxophleba subsp. loxophleba (York
   gum)Acacia acuminata (jam) woodlands in the wheatbelt of South-Western
   Australia. Methods We conducted stratified surveys of floristic
   composition and topsoil nutrient concentrations in 112 woodland patches.
   We used generalized linear models, structural equation models and
   ordinations to characterize relationships among soil nutrients,
   rainfall, exotic annuals and patch-scale (100 m2) native plant
   composition and diversity. Results Patch-scale native plant diversity
   declined strongly with increasing exotic abundance. This was partly
   related to elevated soil nutrient concentrations, particularly total
   nitrogen and available phosphorus. By contrast, there was little
   evidence for positive correlations between soil nutrients and native
   diversity, even at very low soil nutrient concentrations. Main
   conclusions Minimizing weed invasions is crucial for maximizing native
   plant diversity in E. loxophleba woodlands and could include
   nutrient-depleting treatments without substantially compromising the
   functional capacity of soils to maintain native plant richness and
   composition. More broadly we emphasize that understanding relationships
   among ecosystem productivity, plant diversity and exotic invasions in
   the context of associated theoretical frameworks is fundamental for
   informing ecological restoration.}},

Title = {{Plant-mediated and nonadditive effects of two global change drivers on
   an insect herbivore community}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1892-1901}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Warmer temperatures can alter the phenology and distribution of
   individual species. However, differences across species may blur
   community-level phenological responses to climate or cause biotic
   homogenization by consistently favoring certain taxa. Additionally, the
   response of insect communities to climate will be subject to
   plant-mediated effects, which may or may not overshadow the direct
   effect of rising temperatures on insects. Finally, recent evidence for
   the importance of interaction effects between global change drivers
   suggests that phenological responses of communities to climate may be
   altered by other drivers. We used a natural temperature gradient
   (generated by elevation and topology), combined with experimental
   nitrogen fertilization, to investigate the effects of elevated
   temperature and globally increasing anthropogenic nitrogen deposition on
   the structure and phenology of a seminatural grassland herbivore
   assemblage (lepidopteran insects).
   We found that both drivers, alone and in combination, severely altered
   how the relative abundance and composition of species changed through
   time. Importantly, warmer temperatures were associated with biotic
   homogenization, such that herbivore assemblages in the warmest plots had
   more similar species composition than those in intermediate or cool
   plots. Changes in herbivore composition and abundance were largely
   mediated by changes in the plant community, with increased nonnative
   grass cover under high treatment levels being the strongest determinant
   of herbivore abundance. In addition to compositional changes, total
   herbivore biomass more than doubled under elevated nitrogen and
   increased more than fourfold with temperature, bearing important
   functional implications for herbivores as consumers and as a prey
   resource. The crucial role of nonnative plant dominance in mediating
   responses of herbivores to change, combined with the frequent
   nonadditive (positive and negative) effects of the two drivers, and the
   differential responses of species, highlight that understanding complex
   ecosystem responses will benefit from multifactor, multitrophic
   experiments at community scales or larger.}},

Abstract = {{In Mediterranean dry grasslands, grazing by domestic animals is an
   important agricultural activity on dry grasslands. Several bird species
   occur in these grazed habitats and are now experiencing a near
   continuous decline. We investigated the impact of livestock grazing on
   the threatened little bustard (Tetrax tetrax L.). The study was
   conducted at the NATURA 2000 Site/Important Bird Area of Cabrela,
   Portugal. Our main goals were to investigate responses of little bustard
   territorial males and breeding females to different livestock management
   practices, namely pasture types, stocking rates and sward structure.
   Bird distribution was surveyed using car and foot surveys. Data on
   grazing was supplied by land managers every 10 days from February to
   June through field interviews. Generalised additive models and model
   averaging were used to compute predictive models. Results indicate that
   higher probabilities of occurrence were found in long-term pastures and
   under light-moderate grazing conditions (stocking rates around 0.4
   LU/ha). Conversely, lower probabilities of occurrence were found in
   ungrazed or heavy grazed fields. Males occurred mostly in large fields,
   but this variable seemed to be less important for females. On the other
   hand, green plant cover and the vegetation height were good predictors
   for the occurrence of females but not for males. Females used mostly
   pastures with vegetation height around 20-25 cm. Our results suggest
   that grazing management plans that aim to conserve little bustard
   populations should consider (1) the maintenance of the larger long-term
   pastures and (2) the use of light-moderate stocking rates (0.2-0.6
   LU/ha). (c) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{795-802}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{1. Climate change is rarely taken into consideration in conservation
   management strategies aimed at protecting biodiversity from other
   threats. We examined the implications of this perspective in European
   calcareous grasslands, which are among the richest herbaceous systems of
   the continent and are therefore of high nature conservation interest.
   These systems are currently undergoing species loss because of the
   abandonment of agro-pastoral practices. Classic ecological theory
   assumes that conservation management activities (such as regular mowing)
   and drought events should increase diversity through decreased plant
   competition in abandoned mesic communities. In turn, this could reduce
   diversity in xeric communities although positive plant interactions
   (facilitation) might buffer these negative effects and maintain
   diversity. 2. We studied the effects of regular mowing and
   experimentally induced drought on diversity and biotic interactions
   between two transplanted species in mesic and xeric calcareous
   grasslands. The study sites in south-western France have not been
   subjected to any management for the last 30 years. 3. Drought did not
   affect mesic systems although mowing increased plant diversity through
   decreased competition. By contrast, mowing had no significant effect in
   xeric systems although drought decreased diversity. Interestingly,
   transplants were subject to neither competition nor facilitation in the
   xeric systems. 4. Synthesis and applications. Regular mowing and drought
   events impact plant diversity of mesic and xeric calcareous grassland
   communities in different ways. We recommend regular mowing of mesic
   grasslands, even in the context of climate change. By contrast, we
   recommend less-frequent mowing of xeric grasslands together with
   specific interventions such as assisted migration for species with poor
   drought tolerance. Similar studies in other ecosystems on larger spatial
   and temporal scales should examine the dual effects of management and
   climate change to identify appropriate management programmes.}},

Abstract = {{Question A warming climate has been linked to changes in the
   distribution of many species, yet the interactions between climate and
   other environmental drivers are relatively poorly understood. Mountain
   regions are expected to be particularly at risk in a warming climate,
   and in many upland regions land use has also changed dramatically over
   the past few decades, with densities of grazing livestock often
   decreasing. Does livestock grazing influence elevational shifts of plant
   communities? Location Southern Scandes, Norway. Methods We use a unique
   long-term experimental study at the landscape scale along an altitudinal
   gradient to study elevational shifts of plant communities and species
   under high and low sheep densities and in ungrazed conditions. Results
   We show that elevational advance of the whole alpine grassland plant
   community occurred in the absence of herbivores (with a 3 m elevational
   advance over 8 yr), but was suppressed at low sheep density. At high
   sheep density there was a downward shift in plant community composition
   of 4 m. The average change in median altitude across species was
   positive in the absence of herbivores, but not significantly different
   from zero under both grazing treatments. There was no convincing
   evidence that species from lower altitudes showed a greater elevational
   advance than species from higher altitudes. Conclusions This study
   presents evidence that grazing sheep suppressed an elevational advance
   of the plant community, suggesting that grazing can limit the altitude
   of the plant community. This implies that grazing management has the
   potential to buffer climate-driven shifts in plant communities.
   Conversely, the widespread recent changes in land use, with reductions
   in large herbivore densities in alpine areas, could further increase the
   vulnerability of alpine communities to warming.}},

Abstract = {{Questions Is there evidence for biotic homogenization of upland
   vegetation? Do the magnitude and nature of floristic and compositional
   change vary between vegetation types? What can be inferred about the
   drivers responsible for the observed changes? Location Upland heath,
   mire and grassland communities of the northwest Highlands of Scotland,
   UK. Methods We re-survey plots first described in a phytosociological
   study of 19561958 to assess the changes in plant species composition
   over the last 50 yr in five major upland vegetation types. Using a
   combination of multivariate analysis, dissimilarity measures, diversity
   metrics and published data on species attributes; we quantify,
   characterize and link potential drivers of environmental change with the
   observed changes in species composition. Results Grassland and heath
   vegetation declined in species richness and variation in community
   composition, while mires showed little change. Previously distinct
   vegetation types became more similar in composition, characterized by
   the increased dominance of generalist upland graminoids and reduced
   dwarf-shrub, forb and lichen cover, although novel assemblages were not
   apparent. Species with an oceanic distribution increased at the expense
   of those with an arctic-montane distribution. Temperature, precipitation
   and acidity were found to be potentially important in explaining changes
   in species composition: species that had undergone the greatest
   increases had a preference for warmer, drier and more acidic conditions.
   Conclusions The vegetation of the northwest Scottish Highlands has
   undergone marked biotic homogenization over the last 50 yr, manifested
   through a loss of various aspects of diversity at the local, community
   and landscape scales. The magnitude of change varies between vegetation
   types, although the nature of change shows many similar characteristics.
   Analyses of species attributes suggest these changes are driven by
   climate warming and acidification, although over-grazing may also be
   important. This study highlights the importance of the link between the
   loss of plant diversity and homogenization at multiple scales, and
   demonstrates that boreal heath communities are particularly at risk from
   these processes.}},

Abstract = {{Growing traditional ornamental plants in urban soil often fails, due to
   the low quality of the soil modified by anthropic activities. The aim of
   this research was to study the behavior of herbaceous plants suitable
   for sowing in mixes in order to revegetate soils in different urban
   environments.
   Three different mixes of herbaceous plants were studied: N (native) was
   composed of autochthonous species, US (urban short) and UT (urban tall)
   were composed of both autochthonous and allochthonous species. Plant
   height was lower than 60 cm in N and US, and above 60 cm in UT. Each mix
   was sown in three randomized plots and each plot was mown at three
   different times: 110, 140 and 170 days after sowing (early, mid and late
   season respectively). Number of plants per square meter, plant height
   and biomass were recorded at each mowing time. In order to assess how
   well the plants would establish themselves we calculated the Shannon
   diversity index, the evenness of species and Simpson's index of
   dominance.
   The N mix composed of autochthonous species resulted to be well-balanced
   with an equal number of annual and perennial species grown. The presence
   of annuals and perennials made the community richer and the individual
   plants more evenly distributed. The best mowing time to improve
   diversity in all the mixes was late-season. Our study suggests that
   native species from southern Europe are suitable for creating diverse
   herbaceous communities for ornamental purposes, thus enhancing the role
   of Mediterranean urban areas in the conservation of biodiversity. (C)

Title = {{Distinguishing between human-induced and climate-driven vegetation
   changes: a critical application of RESTREND in inner Mongolia}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Changes in the spatiotemporal pattern of vegetation alter the structure
   and function of landscapes, consequently affecting biodiversity and
   ecological processes. Distinguishing human-induced vegetation changes
   from those driven by environmental variations is critically important
   for ecological understanding and management of landscapes. The main
   objectives of this study were to detect human-induced vegetation changes
   and evaluate the impacts of land use policies in the Xilingol grassland
   region of Inner Mongolia, using the NDVI-based residual trend (RESTREND)
   method. Our results show that human activity (livestock grazing) was the
   primary driver for the observed vegetation changes during the period of
   1981-2006. Specifically, vegetation became increasingly degraded from
   the early 1980s when the land use policy-the Household Production
   Responsibility System-led to soaring stocking rates for about two
   decades. Since 2000, new institutional arrangements for grassland
   restoration and conservation helped curb and even reverse the increasing
   trend in stocking rates, resulting in large-scale vegetation
   improvements in the region. These results suggest that most of the
   degraded grasslands in the Xilingol region can recover through
   ecologically sound land use policies or institutional arrangements that
   keep stocking rates under control. Our study has also demonstrated that
   the RESTREND method is a useful tool to help identify human-induced
   vegetation changes in arid and semiarid landscapes where plant cover and
   production are highly coupled with precipitation. To effectively use the
   method, however, one needs to carefully deal with the problems of
   heterogeneity and scale in space and time, both of which may lead to
   erroneous results and misleading interpretations.}},

Title = {{The importance of plant-soil interactions, soil nutrients, and plant

   chronosequence of old-fields}},
Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1251-1262}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We examined to what extent temporal dynamics of Jacobaea vulgaris cover
   in old-fields were related to plantsoil feedback, soil nutrients, seed
   availability and performance, and seedling establishment. Long-term
   measurements at an experimental field and in ten old-fields representing
   a chronosequence following land abandonment revealed a remarkably
   similar hump-shaped temporal pattern of J. vulgaris cover, which peaked
   at about five years after abandonment. In a plantsoil feedback study, J.
   vulgaris biomass of plants grown in soil from all chronosequence fields
   was lower than in sterilized control soil. However, biomass of J.
   vulgaris in the feedback study was lower when grown in soil collected
   from fields with a high density of J. vulgaris plants than in soil from
   fields with a low density of J. vulgaris. When plants were grown again
   in the conditioned soil, a strong negative plantsoil feedback response
   was observed for soils from all fields. These results indicate that
   soils from all stages of the chronosequence can develop a strong
   negative soil feedback to J. vulgaris, and that there is a positive
   relationship between J. vulgaris density and the subsequent level of
   control by the soil community. In a common-garden experiment with turfs
   collected from the chronosequence fields in which J. vulgaris was
   seeded, seedling establishment was significantly lower in turfs from
   older than from young fields. In a seed bank study the number of
   emerging seedlings declined with time since abandonment of the field. In
   conclusion, negative plantsoil feedback is an important factor
   explaining the hump-shaped population development of J. vulgaris.
   However, it is not operating alone, as propagule availability and
   characteristics, and competition may also be important. Thus, in order
   to explain its contribution to plant population dynamics, the role of
   biotic plantsoil interactions, soil nutrients and life history
   characteristics along successional gradients should be considered from a
   community perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Many grassland plant species have limited capacity to disperse their
   seeds beyond local boundaries by natural means. Meanwhile, various forms
   of human transportation are observed to provide long-distance dispersal.
   However, the contribution of human-mediated dispersal to the spatial
   dynamics of established (meta)populations on the regional scale has only
   scarcely been addressed. Trifolium micranthum is a very small legume
   that is rare in western Belgium. It is found (i) inland, as a lawn weed
   on war cemeteries that are managed by the Commonwealth War Graves
   Commission, and (ii) in coastal grasslands that are managed for
   conservation. These stations lie over 30 km apart, though interestingly,
   a number of satellite war cemeteries are found within the vicinity of
   the coastal reserves, and these also harbor T. micranthum. We have
   sampled plants from these populations to study their affinities through
   genetic analysis (AFLP). Results indicated that the coastal cemetery
   populations were closely related to the inland cemeteries and not to the
   coastal reserves. This most likely is the result of exchange of seeds
   with composted lawn material among regions, whereas mowing machinery and
   livestock may effectuate frequent dispersal within regions. Assignment
   tests nonetheless indicated limited genetic admixture to have taken
   place at the coastal cemeteries. Thus, human management is responsible
   for the realization of gene flow among these remote gene pools.
   Human-mediated long-distance dispersal is likely to play a role in the
   local or regional dynamics of many other native plants, including more
   common and well-dispersing species.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},

Pages = {{709-720}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Question Trait scaling relationships involve multiple trade-offs and
   allometric constraints between the traits of co-existing species.
   Alternative trait relationships, particularly between plant size and
   other traits, are expected in response to combinations of different
   biotic and abiotic filters. To what extent does the expected convergence
   in plant attributes to water shortage and disturbance produce different
   trait scaling relationships in dry vs wet meadows under various
   disturbance regimes? Locations One test meadow in South Bohemia and one
   in South Moravia (i.e. wet vs dry Central Europe meadows), Czech
   Republic. Methods Selected species were sampled in mown and abandoned
   plots within each site. Several plant traits were measured to provide
   information on plant strategies related to growth, resource acquisition
   and carbonwater economy. Results Trait differentiation among co-existing
   species was strong in both meadows, and generally stronger than
   differentiation caused by mowing and site effects. Different trait
   scaling relationships with plant height were observed across the
   meadows, particularly showing a more independent trait differentiation
   linked to watercarbon economy at the dry site. Mowing tended to
   reinforce the effect of water limitation on traits and on trait scaling.
   In contrast, mowing cessation tended to resemble the effect of humid
   conditions on trait relationships. Conclusions The results advocate
   incorporating trait scaling relationships between species into
   vegetation models and community assembly assessments, therefore
   accounting for processes of plant co-existence along combined spectra of
   light, water and disturbance regimes. These gradients affect alternative
   life-history strategies and possibly sustain different species
   co-existence patterns based on different trait scaling. The results
   particularly advocate a convergence in traits and trait scaling
   relationships in response to the combination of disturbance and water
   limitation.}},

Abstract = {{The nature of ecological stability is still debated, and there is a need
   to establish which types of communities show resistance to environmental
   change and to explore community responses in relation to their
   environmental context. This study aims to investigate the effects of
   reinstating cutting management on abandoned wet grasslands by comparing
   responses in two different communities with contrasting environmental
   conditions, to elucidate the restoration potential of wet grasslands.
   Two coastal wet grassland plant communities in Estonia were monitored
   over 5 years: a species-poor lower shore grassland and a more diverse
   tall grassland. Piezometers and soil samples were used to characterise
   the hydrology, while cutting effects and ongoing abandonment were
   compared using replicate quadrats in both grasslands. Annual changes and
   significant differences in community composition were analysed using
   Detrended and Canonical Correspondence Analyses, diversity indices, and
   inferential statistics. The results showed that cutting produced greater
   changes in composition and species abundance in the lower shore
   community compared to the tall grassland, including a greater proportion
   of significant differences. The increased responsiveness of the lower
   shore community may be related to its variable hydrological regime,
   especially flooding, which creates a dynamic environment favouring
   adaptable species. In contrast, the tall grassland featured a more
   stable water regime and species that responded less to perturbation, and
   manifested resistance to cutting management. Thus, restoring abandoned
   wet grasslands through vegetation management may be a slow process,
   especially where there is residual diversity, and the importance of
   hydrological regime in determining wet grassland communities should be
   considered.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{All living organisms are linked through trophic relationships with
   resources and consumers, the balance of which determines overall
   ecosystem stability and functioning. Ecological research has identified
   a multitude of mechanisms that contribute to this balance, but
   ecologists are now challenged with predicting responses to global
   environmental changes. Despite a wealth of studies highlighting likely
   outcomes for specific mechanisms and subsets of a system (e.g., plants,
   plant-herbivore or predator-prey interactions), studies comparing
   overall effects of changes at multiple trophic levels are rare. We used
   a combination of experiments in a grassland system to test how biomass
   at the plant, herbivore and natural enemy (parasitoid) levels responds
   to the interactive effects of two key global change drivers: warming and
   nitrogen deposition. We found that higher temperatures and elevated
   nitrogen generated a multitrophic community that was increasingly
   dominated by herbivores. Moreover, we found synergistic effects of the
   drivers on biomass, which differed across trophic levels. Both absolute
   and relative biomass of herbivores increased disproportionately to that
   of plants and, in particular, parasitoids, which did not show any
   significant response to the treatments. Reduced parasitism rates
   mirrored the profound biomass changes in the system. These findings
   carry important implications for the response of biota to environmental
   changes; reduced top-down regulation is likely to coincide with an
   increase in herbivory, which in turn is likely to cascade to other
   fundamental ecosystem processes. Our findings also provide multitrophic
   data to support the general concern of increasing herbivore pest
   outbreaks in a warmer world.}},

Abstract = {{This study tested whether agri-environment scheme (AES) management for
   corncrakes in the UK is associated with higher diversity or abundance of
   non-target flora and fauna relative to similar land outside AES
   management. The species richness and abundance of forbs, butterflies,
   bumblebees and foliar arthropods were compared on 101 paired
   control-treatment plots across the two AES measures for corncrakes:
   provision of tall vegetation throughout the breeding season (Early and
   Late Cover; ELC) and delayed mowing (DM) of hay or silage fields. There
   were significant positive effects of AES management for the species
   richness of forbs, and abundance of late-season flowers, butterflies,
   bumblebees and the majority of foliar arthropod groups on one or both
   AES measures. Significant negative effects of AES were found in only two
   cases: forb species richness (ELC only) and the abundance of springtails
   (DM only). For the remaining species and groups studied there was either
   no effect of AES or no clear difference due to strong AES x season
   interactions. The magnitude of the AES effects varied substantially both
   between taxonomic groups and the two measures for corncrake. Most of the
   positive effects were for common and widespread species, except for two
   rare bumblebees. The benefits resulted from the reduction in farmland
   management intensity associated with AES. While not beneficial to all
   taxonomic groups these results demonstrate that, in the case of
   corncrakes in the UK at least, well-designed AES measures targeted at a
   specific species do yield wider biodiversity benefits. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Non-flying mammal richness and distribution were studied in a landscape
   matrix consisting of a highly managed agro-silvo-pastoral system
   dominated by a cork oak woodland (montado) to test the predictions of
   the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis (IDH). Sampling consisted on
   detection of mammalian signs of presence, along with the use of scent
   stations and small mammal live-trapping. Results were analyzed using
   generalized linear models, considering land uses, landscape metrics and
   grazing intensity and gave support to the predictions of the IDH. Pure
   forestry and intensive agricultural uses showed lower species richness
   than the silvopastoral system, whilst landscape heterogeneity and
   riparian corridors were shown to be most beneficial to mammal species
   richness, with small mammals being directly and negatively affected by
   grazing intensity. The increasing use of the montado for raising cattle
   has led to landscape homogenization by means of grazing and shrub
   clearance for pasture cultivation and this, combined with incremented
   stocking rates, constrains species richness. In this landscape context,
   watercourses assume a relevant role as patches of suitable habitat
   providing shelter, food, movement corridors and dispersion routes for
   mammals. Recent options of fencing forest patches with good forest
   natural regeneration or with a high diversity/density of Mediterranean
   maquis, and restoring degraded watercourses, both to improve landscape
   heterogeneity, appear to positively affect the mammal community. This is
   a current challenge in terms of monitoring and research.}},

Abstract = {{. 1. Abandonment of traditional activities in the rural areas is
   widespread in the developed world, and in the case of grazing, it is
   known to have negative consequences on the diversity of plant
   communities. Few studies have examined the impact of grazing abandonment
   on fauna, which in the case of ants is of considerable interest, given
   their usefulness as an indicator for monitoring environmental change. 2.
   Here, we present the results of a study conducted in Mediterranean
   grasslands of central Spain. Using pitfall traps, ants were sampled from
   10 40 mx 20 m plots; five of them located in grazed systems and five in
   abandoned grazing systems. Descriptors used for the ant assemblage were
   ant species composition, ant species richness, ant functional groups,
   and subguilds of granivores. We used a seed bait test to discriminate
   between granivorous and non-granivorous ant species. 3. Our results show
   that abandoned grazing systems have more ant species and more
   heterogeneous ant assemblages. Changes in ant species composition and
   ant functional groups are more pronounced in habitats where woody
   encroachment progresses more rapidly (i.e. dry sectors and tree
   islands). Specialised granivores have reduced importance in the same
   habitat types. Conversely, facultative granivores increase their
   presence in abandoned grazing systems. 4. The increased functional and
   species ant diversity observed with grazing abandonment can be explained
   by the generation of a more heterogeneous environment at the smaller
   scales, in spite of being more homogenous at the larger scales, because
   the latter are less significant for the organisms studied.}},

   increasing interest in native plants of North America for rangeland
   reseeding in the semiarid regions of western Canada. However, there is
   limited information available on forage yield, nutritive value and
   response to grazing of seeded native plant mixture. The objective of
   this study was to compare foliar cover, forage yield, and nutritive
   value of two different native plant mixtures under grazing. In 20012004,
   a study was initiated on Orthic Brown Chernozemic (Aridic Haploboroll)
   soil near Swift Current (lat. 50 degrees 25'N, long. 107 degrees 44'W),
   Canada. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with a
   full factorial arrangement of seed mixtures (7 species and 14 species)
   and stocking rates (1.3 and 2.7 animal units ha(-1)) with four
   replications of each treatment combination. The 7-species mixture
   produced more forage than the 14-species mixture in July, August, and
   September of all study years. The 7-species mixture, however, had lower
   crude protein than the 14-species mixture in August and September in
   2002 and 2003. Neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber
   concentrations were generally similar between the two mixtures for July,
   August, and September sampling for all 3 yr. Foliar cover of awned
   wheatgrass {[}(Elymus trachycaulus (Link) Gould \& Shin. ssp subsecundus
   (Link) A. \& D. Love.] and slender wheatgrass {[}Elymus trachycaulus
   (Link) Gould subsp. trachycaulus] was higher in the 7-species mixture
   than the 14-species mixture, but foliar cover of other species was
   similar between the two mixtures. Shrub species were rarely observed in
   the stand at any year. Higher stocking rate decreased foliar cover of
   slender wheatgrass and weeds, but foliar cover of other species was
   similar between the two stocking rates. Based on the results, a seed
   mixture of native cool-season grasses may be more productive than a
   combination of native warm- and cool-season grasses under semiarid
   region of western Canada, but inclusion of warm-season grasses could
   improve nutritive value by increasing protein content in the late summer
   months.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrients are important determinants of community assembly, yet the
   roles they play in structuring plant communities are still poorly
   understood. One inferential approach to understanding how environmental
   factors structure plant communities is examining the distribution of key
   functional traits among species of a community-a community traitscape.
   To better understand how nitrogen (N) and water availability structure
   grasslands, we measured N concentrations and isotope ratios for 366
   herbaceous species in a mesic N-limited temperate grassland, Konza
   Prairie. We also compared foliar N concentrations and N isotopes between
   Konza species and a global dataset.
   Species that had either high foliar N concentrations or high delta
   N-15(L) were not necessarily more or less abundant on the landscape nor
   more or less likely to be found in uplands, grazed areas, or burned
   areas. Apparently there are unique hot spots of high N availability at
   Konza and the typical non-Fabaceae Konza species occupies sites with
   greater N availability than found globally.
   Although nascent, the Konza traitscapes suggest that plant diversity in
   nutrient-limited communities might be strongly dependent on
   high-nutrient availability sites that enable high-fertility species to
   persist in a matrix of low nutrient availability.}},

Volume = {{84}},

Abstract = {{Semi-dry grasslands in the White Carpathian (Bile Karpaty) Mountains on
   the Czech-Slovak border are famous for their extremely high species
   richness. In places they contain more than 130 species of vascular
   plants per 100 m(2) and for some plot sizes they hold world records in
   the number of vascular plant species, but the reasons for this are
   poorly understood. Here we ask whether the high number of species in
   these grasslands can be explained by local ecological factors. We
   compared the White Carpathian grasslands with similar grasslands in
   adjacent areas in the west (southern Moravia) and the east (Inner
   Western Carpathians), which are on average notably poorer in species
   than those in the White Carpathians. In both of these areas, we sampled
   grasslands that were among the species-richest in the regional context
   and had a similar physiognomy, species composition and ecology as those
   in the White Carpathians. We found 75 sites with >70 and >25 species of
   vascular plants per 100 m(2) and 1 m(2), respectively, in which we
   recorded species composition and local environmental conditions,
   including precipitation, soil depth, soil pH and nutrient
   concentrations, above-ground biomass production and nutrients in plant
   biomass. Although the White Carpathian grasslands were considerably
   richer in species than the richest grasslands in the adjacent regions,
   there were no differences in the values of the factors studied that
   could provide an unequivocal explanation of their high species richness.
   However, the values of the factors studied were within the ranges
   reported in the literature as conducive to high species richness in
   temperate grasslands. We conclude that the high species richness
   recorded in the White Carpathian grasslands cannot be explained by a
   single factor. It results from a unique combination of regional factors
   (long history of these grasslands, large size of individual grassland
   areas and their existence in a landscape mosaic with forests, scrub and
   small wetlands), local abiotic factors (soil pH, soil nutrient status,
   moisture regime and resulting grassland productivity that are suitable
   for many species from the regional species pool) and management (low
   fertilizer input and mowing once a year in late spring or summer).}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of plant community can greatly affect the abundance and
   diversity of arthropods associated to that community, but can also
   influence the composition or abundance of arthropods on individual
   plants growing in that community. We sampled arthropods and recorded
   plant size of individual ragwort, Jacobaea vulgaris Gaertner ssp.
   vulgaris {[}synonym Senecio jacobaea L. (Asteraceae)], plants
   transplanted into 70 experimental grassland plots that differed in plant
   diversity (19 species) or that were kept without vegetation. The
   arthropod fauna was dominated by the specialist aphid Aphis jacobaeae
   Schrank (Hemiptera: Aphididae). The abundance of aphids on ragwort
   plants decreased significantly with increasing plant diversity. The
   abundance of other arthropod species was not affected by the diversity
   of the surrounding plant community. Plant size was also not affected by
   the diversity of the surrounding plant community, but varied
   significantly among monocultures. Ragwort plants were largest in
   monocultures of legumes. Aphid abundance on ragwort plants, however, was
   not related to the size of the individual ragwort plants, but was high
   in monocultures consisting of Tanacetum vulgare L. (Asteraceae) plants.
   This plant is morphologically similar to ragwort. Even though we
   observed significant effects of plant diversity, ragwort plants were
   considerably larger and the abundance of aphids and other arthropods on
   ragwort plants substantially higher in plots without vegetation than in
   vegetated plots. Our results show that the presence and the diversity of
   neighbouring plants can provide associational resistance to focal plants
   growing in that community. We conclude that the surrounding plant
   community directly affects the abundance of arthropods on focal ragwort
   plants, and not via the effects of neighbouring plants on the
   performance of the focal plants.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands being used in sheep farming systems are managed under a
   variety of agricultural production, recreational and conservational
   objectives. Although sheep grazing is rarely considered the best method
   for delivering conservation objectives in seminatural temperate
   grasslands, the literature does not provide unequivocal evidence on the
   impact of sheep grazing on pasture biodiversity. Our aim was therefore
   to review evidence of the impacts of stocking rate, grazing period and
   soil fertility on plant communities and arthropod populations in both
   mesotrophic grasslands typical of agriculturally improved areas and in
   native plant communities. We therefore conducted a literature search of
   articles published up to the end of the year 2010 using `sheep' and
   `grazing' as keywords, together with variables describing grassland
   management, plant community structure or arthropod taxa. The filtering
   process led to the selection of 48 articles, with 42 included in the
   stocking rate dataset, 9 in the grazing period dataset and 10 in the
   soil fertility dataset The meta-analysis did not reveal any significant
   trends for plant species richness or plant community evenness along a
   wide stocking rate gradient. However, we found frequent shifts in
   functional groups or plant species abundance that could be explained by
   the functional properties of the plants in the community. The
   meta-analysis confirmed that increasing soil fertility decreased plant
   species richness. Despite the very limited dataset, plant species
   richness was significantly greater in autumn-grazed pastures than in
   ungrazed areas, which suggests that choosing an appropriate grazing
   period would be a promising option for preserving biodiversity in sheep
   farming systems. Qualitative review indicated that low grazing intensity
   had positive effects on Orthoptera, Hemiptera (especially phytophagous
   Auchenorrhyncha) and, despite a diverse range of feeding strategies, for
   the species richness of Coleoptera. Lepidoptera, which were favoured by
   more abundant flowering plants, also benefited from low grazing
   intensities. Spider abundance and species richness were higher in
   ungrazed than in grazed pastures. In contrast, there are insufficient
   published studies to draw any firm conclusions on the benefits of late
   grazing or stopping fertilization on insect diversity, and no grounds
   for including any of this information in decision support tools at this
   stage.}},

Pages = {{1-10}},

Abstract = {{Mowing for hay is a widely adopted practice for grasslands utilization
   and management. However, its effects on energy partitioning have not
   well been studied. Our primary objective was to examine the role of
   mowing as a disturbance factor acting on energy partitioning and
   relationships between community composition/structure and energy fluxes
   in a typical steppe ecosystem through a long-term field experiment in
   Inner Mongolia. After four years of annual mowing, dominant species
   changed from Stipa krylovii to Artemisia frigida. Mowing decreased hay
   productivity via the reduction of palatable perennial bunchgrass. During
   the growing season, soil moisture was 47.5\% lower and soil surface
   temperature was 7.4 degrees C higher at midday and 2.2 degrees C lower
   at predawn, with a 4.2 degrees C greater diurnal soil temperature range
   at 2 cm depth in the heavily mowed plots compared to that in the unmowed
   plots. Heavily mowing lowered 6\% net radiation and 98 MJ m(-2)
   available energy, but elevated 2.1 times soil heat flux. Heavily mowed
   plots shared higher sensible heat flux, but similar latent heat flux.
   The absence of mowing might alleviate the stress of high temperature and
   drought during the hot and dry periods, leading to a high resistance of
   vegetation to environmental changes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Although the impacts of the loss of biodiversity on ecosystem
   functioning are well established, the importance of the loss of
   biodiversity relative to other human-caused drivers of environmental
   change remains uncertain. Results of 11 experiments show that
   ecologically relevant decreases in grassland plant diversity influenced
   productivity at least as much as ecologically relevant changes in
   nitrogen, water, CO2, herbivores, drought, or fire. Moreover,
   biodiversity became an increasingly dominant driver of ecosystem
   productivity through time, whereas effects of other factors either
   declined (nitrogen addition) or remained unchanged (all others). In
   particular, a change in plant diversity from four to 16 species caused
   as large an increase in productivity as addition of 54 kg.ha(-1).y(-1)
   of fertilizer N, and was as influential as removing a dominant
   herbivore, a major natural drought, water addition, and fire
   suppression. A change in diversity from one to 16 species caused a
   greater biomass increase than 95 kg.ha(-1).y(-1) of N or any other
   treatment. Our conclusions are based on >7,000 productivity measurements
   from 11 long-term experiments (mean length, similar to 13 y) conducted
   at a single site with species from a single regional species pool, thus
   controlling for many potentially confounding factors. Our results
   suggest that the loss of biodiversity may have at least as great an
   impact on ecosystem functioning as other anthropogenic drivers of
   environmental change, and that use of diverse mixtures of species may be
   as effective in increasing productivity of some biomass crops as
   fertilization and may better provide ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of grazing-induced spatial patterns of vegetation was
   analyzed at two spatial scales (25 m x 20 m areas and 1.6 m x 0.8 m
   grids) in pastures of contrasting productivity (maximum standing
   biomass: 130-800 gDM/m(2)). At both scales, the mosaic of grazed and
   ungrazed patches was modeled as a Boolean process, calculating
   cross-variograms to quantify the temporal stability of grazing patterns
   and its links with local floristic composition were tested. The scale at
   which stability of vegetation patterns took place in two successive
   years depended on pasture productivity. Inter-annual stability of
   large-scale patterns mainly occurred in extensively used fertile
   pastures grazed by cattle, and in pastures grazed by horses.
   Less-fertile grasslands were mainly characterized by a fine-scale
   stability of grazing patterns. Stable fine-scale patterns were often
   related to the local abundance of legumes and forbs. Stable large-scale
   patterns of grazing within lightly grazed productive grasslands could
   result in divergent local vegetation dynamics, which can be seen as an
   opportunity for restoring biodiversity in fertile grasslands. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Hispid hare Caprolagus hispidus is one of the less studied endangered
   small mammal species in the world. Hispid hare distribution includes the
   tropical grassland ecosystem in Nepal. Grassland fire is one of the
   management regimes used in this region and its impact on biodiversity is
   controversial. We investigated the diet and habitat use of hispid hare
   before and after a grassland fire at Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve (SWR)
   in Nepal. Fecal pellets were used for micro-histological analysis to
   understand hispid hare diet. We laid out sampling plots in areas where
   we encountered hispid hare sign and recorded habitat and vegetation
   information. We also looked for signs of hare presence along
   systematically positioned transect lines and used these data to assess
   the population status of hispid hare. Population density of hispid hare
   was 5.76 individuals/km(2) and we estimated a population size of 219 +/-
   40 hispid hare within the 41 km(2) grasslands of SWR. Hispid hare
   primarily used tall grassland habitat. Nineteen plant species were
   identified in hispid hare pellets with Saccharum spontaneum and Imperata
   cylindrica having the highest frequency of occurrence. There were no
   significant differences in the distribution of plant species in the
   pellets before and after the fire; however a significantly higher
   diversity of plants were recorded in hispid hare diet after the fire. We
   recommend a change to the timing of grass burning to either before or
   after the hispid hare breeding season to reduce the direct (burning,
   destruction of nests) and indirect (increased risk of predation)
   negative effects of such grassland management on hare populations.
   Population management strategies and a field based conservation captive
   breeding program should be implemented immediately to maintain a viable
   population of hispid hare in SWR.}},

Title = {{Fifty years of change in Central European grassland vegetation: Large
   losses in species richness and animal-pollinated plants}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{150}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{76-85}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{There is growing concern that biodiversity loss in European agricultural
   landscapes is having negative effects on functional trait diversity.
   Long-term studies examining vegetation changes from the period before
   agricultural industrialisation are however rare. Here, we ask how
   management intensification and increased nutrient input initiated in the
   1950/1960s have altered grassland plant community composition, species
   diversity and functional trait composition using comprehensive datasets
   from five floodplain regions (plus one protected reference region) in
   northern Germany. Sites with available historical releves and vegetation
   maps (1950/1960s, 19905) were resampled in 2008 to facilitate the
   analysis of a period spanning four to five decades.
   Plant community composition changed tremendously in all study regions
   during the 50 year period, which was related to increasing Ellenberg
   indicator values for nutrient availability. Species richness at the
   plot-level fell by 30-50\% over the period, and losses in functional
   diversity were equally large. A non-formal comparison with the results
   from the protected reference study region indicates that the changes may
   mostly be attributable to local nutrient input rather than to
   supra-regional climate change. Our results indicate a consistent trend
   towards much more species-poor communities dominated by mow-tolerant,
   N-demanding competitive grasses, whereas species with more ruderal
   strategies, species flowering early in the season and, in particular,
   insect-pollinated herbs have all decreased. The substantial loss of
   nectar-producing grassland herbs is likely to have negative effects on
   the abundance of pollinating insects, with consequences for the
   grassland animal communities. This highlights the growing need for
   adequate grassland management schemes with low N input to preserve
   high-nature-value grassland. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   size (20-100 cm in diameter) were artificially created in three
   vegetation communities (sown, aged sown and native pastures), and
   vegetation recovery in the gaps was monitored. Undisturbed patches (100
   x 100 cm) were also monitored as a control. The similarity of botanical
   composition to the control was lowest in the 20 cm gaps, irrespective of
   the disturbance or vegetation types. Vegetation in the bare ground gaps
   tended to recover slower in 20 cm gaps than in 100 cm gaps in all
   vegetation types. Small gaps created by cattle activities may enhance
   vegetation species diversity while it may decrease productivity of

Abstract = {{This research examines student perception of sustainable landscaping at

   landscaping practices on university campuses. Reduced mowing (once per
   year), as it is implemented on Laird Campus, was identified as the
   sustainable practice least likely to be considered acceptable by
   students. Sustainable landscaping interpretation improved student
   awareness and acceptance of sustainable landscaping practices. Greater
   levels of engagement with the interpretation campaign increased
   students' awareness and acceptance of sustainable landscaping. In
   contrast to students' increased awareness and acceptance of sustainable
   landscaping practices, students' perception of the landscape's
   appearance did not significantly improve after the interpretation

Journal = {{APPLIED ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{18-25}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing global interest in the extent to which multi-species
   grasslands containing increased plant diversity compared with improved
   grasslands can also deliver higher resource protection. The objective of
   this experiment was to examine nutrient returns via faeces and urine by
   free-ranging cattle grazing semi-natural grassland which contribute to
   leaching losses to ground water along with volatilisation and
   denitrification losses to the atmosphere. Reduction of grazing intensity
   has frequently been recommended to meet biodiversity and production
   goals in sustainable grazing systems. In this experiment beef cattle
   were continuously stocked on semi-natural (Lolium perenne-Cynosurus
   cristatus) grassland at grazing intensities which were designed to
   either utilise herbage growth for optimum livestock production
   (Moderate), or to increase biodiversity by not fully utilising herbage
   growth (Lenient) in three replicate blocks. Observations were made in
   May and September of the number and timing of individual defaecation and
   urination events between dawn and dusk. In addition, the quantities of
   fresh material excreted in individual defaecation or urination events
   were collected and measured. For cattle grazing the Moderate and Lenient
   treatments, respectively, the daily number of defaecation events was
   10.0 vs. 9.3 (F prob. = 0.448) in May; 10.0 vs. 9.8 (F prob. = 0.821) in
   September. The estimated daily total of fresh faeces excreted animal(-1)
   was 10.8 vs. 9.5 kg (F prob. = 0.503) in May; 15.3 vs. 17.4 kg (F prob.
   = 0.480) in September. The daily number of urinations was 13.4 vs. 13.5
   (F prob. = 0.941) in May; 9.4 vs. 12.7 (F prob. = 0.077) in September.
   The estimated daily total amount of urine produced animal-1 was 9.9 vs.
   10.4 kg (F prob. = 0.808) in May; 7.2 vs. 11.9 kg in September (F prob.
   = <0.001). Subsamples of faeces and urine were analysed for N and P
   concentrations. The total daily outputs of N (faeces + urine) animal(-1)
   were 77 vs. 75 g N day(-1) (F prob. = 0.903) in May; 96 vs. 122 g N
   day(-1) (F prob. = 0.369) and urine N as a proportion of the total N
   excreted was 0.51 vs. 0.58 in May (F prob. = 0.215); 0.53 vs. 0.59 in
   September (F prob. = 0.464). Most of the P excreted (proportionately
   0.99) was excreted in the faeces for both grazing intensities in May and
   September. The daily numbers of excretion events animal(-1) were similar
   to other published values but a lower proportion of the total daily N
   output was excreted as urine compared with published values for cattle
   grazing fertilised, improved intensive swards. The potential impact of
   this on losses to soil water and the atmosphere should be examined. (C)

Title = {{Do climate, resource availability, and grazing pressure filter floristic
   composition and functioning in Alpine pastures?}},

Abstract = {{We studied the floristic composition in the pastures of the Southern
   Alps (Trento Province, Italy). One hundred and five plots in seven
   different pasture plant communities were sampled: (1) nitrophilous, (2)
   montane mesic, (3) subalpine mesic, (4) calcareous montane, (5)
   calcareous subalpine, (6) acid montane, and (7) acid subalpine pastures.
   Forward selection and variation partitioning were applied to identify
   the most important factors controlling the species composition and plant
   traits in the pastures. Aggregated weighted averages were calculated for
   each plot using the published values of average height, specific leaf
   area, and seed mass for each species. Explanatory variables were
   recorded for each site to reflect climate, soil properties, and grazing
   pressure. We hypothesised that species composition and functional
   variation in pastures of the Southern Alps are controlled by three main
   environmental filters: climate, resource availability, and grazing
   pressure. We found that variables of climate and soil properties had a
   major role in explaining the species composition and variations in plant
   traits, while grazing pressure showed a lower independent effect.
   Species composition and plant traits depended mainly on temperature,
   soil fertility, and variables of bedrock type - soil pH. Our results
   confirm the importance of taking the effects of climate and resource
   availability into account when describing plant and community functions
   of grasslands.}},

Title = {{How does plant species composition change from year to year? A case
   study from the herbaceous layer of a submediterranean oak woodland}},
Journal = {{COMMUNITY ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{88-96}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Over millions of years there is a long-term increase in species
   richness, accompanied by substantial turnover in species composition.
   However, little is known about species temporal turnover over shorter,
   ecologically relevant time periods, such as years. In the present study,
   we examine the inter-annual temporal turnover in species composition in
   100 m(2) plots of the herbaceous layer in a submediterranean oak
   woodland over six years. We found that approximately half of the
   accumulated number of species over the six years is accommodated as
   temporal turnover. We also found that species temporal turnover in
   undisturbed control plots was not significantly different from that in
   plots where vegetation was recovering naturally without assistance,
   i.e., plots undergoing ecological succession. Only in the most disturbed
   (continuously overgrazed) plots temporal turnover was low to
   non-existent. We therefore suggest that diversity estimates based on a
   single year of observations may seriously underestimate species richness
   or the detrimental effects of disturbance, at least at the 100 m(2)
   scale. Furthermore, we found that, with the exception of the heavily
   grazed plots, short-lived species (annuals and biennials) did not
   display significantly greater temporal turnover than long-lived
   (perennial) species. Our analysis also supports that the space for time
   substitution applies in the patterns of species turnover. Spatial
   species turnover was comparable to temporal turnover. Species that are
   observed in many plots are also present in many years, and vice versa.
   Also, the similarity in species composition decreased as the time period
   between observations increased, as is the case with distance decay.
   Overall we conclude that the patterns of species turnover in time
   resemble those in space, and thus temporal turnover makes an important
   contribution to total biodiversity that should not be ignored.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARID LAND}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{4}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Soil seed banks play an important role in the distribution and
   composition of plant communities in semiarid grassland ecosystems.
   However, information on how spatial scale influences the spatial
   heterogeneity of soil seed banks in a grassland under grazing
   disturbance is still lacking. Based on field sampling and greenhouse
   germination, we measured the species composition and seed density of
   soil seed banks at different spatial scales (30 mx30 m, 30 mx60 m and 30
   mx90 m) along a topographical gradient in a sandy grassland in Horqin
   Sand Land, Northern China. By applying geostatistical methods, we
   examined how spatial scale and topography affected the spatial
   distribution of soil seed banks in the study area. Our results showed
   that the total number of species in soil seed banks, as well as the
   number of dominant annuals, increased with the increase of spatial
   scales. Seed density in soil seed banks decreased with the increase of
   spatial scales due to an increase in the slopes and relative heights of
   the sampling points. Geostatistical analysis showed that the relative
   structural variance (C/(C-o+C)) of seed density and species richness
   were over 65\% for all spatial scales, indicating that these variables
   had an obvious spatial autocorrelation and the spatial structured
   variance accounted for the largest proportion of the total sample
   variance. Spatial autocorrelation of seed density in soil seed banks
   increased with the increase of measured scales, while that of species
   richness showed a reverse trend. These results suggest that the total
   number of species in soil seed banks is spatial scale dependent and
   lower topography may accommodate more seeds. Spatial distribution of
   seed density in soil seed banks is also scale dependent due to
   topographic variation. Grassland management, therefore, needs to
   consider local grazing disturbance regime, spatial scale and topography.}},

Abstract = {{The Almbach, a headwater stream in the Upper Austrian foothills of the
   Alps bordered by mountain pastures was studied to gain insight into the
   benthic macroinvertebrate community and its habitat. Two springs, one of
   them fenced in to prevent livestock access, and two more sites of the
   headwater section were investigated. A discriminant analysis (DA) based
   on hydrochemistry and phytobenthos revealed three functions with 86\% of
   all samples correctly classified to the four sites. The first function
   clearly separated the two springs with phosphorus and oxygen as the most
   important discriminating factors. Spring sites and headwater sites were
   split up by the second function mainly due to nitrate concentration, but
   no differences could be detected for the two stream sites. With the
   exception of the fenced spring, indicator taxa could be assigned to all
   sites by means of an Indicator Species Analysis (ISA). Polyvalent taxa
   groups such as Gastropoda and Ostracoda were indicators for the unfenced
   spring site. This is in accordance to observed low abundances of
   sensitive plecopteran taxa and suggests a negative impact of livestock
   trampling on the invertebrate community. Redundancy Analysis explained
   99\% of the macroinvertebrate-environment relation. The first axis
   separated springs from stream sites and was correlated with nitrate, pH,
   water temperature and phytobenthos eveness. Phosphorus was responsible
   for splitting the unfenced spring and the downstream station from the
   fenced spring and the upstream location along the second axis.
   Ephemeropteran taxa like Habrophlebia sp. were related to elevated pH,
   increased water temperature and low nitrate concentrations. In
   accordance to the ISA, nitrate played an important role for tolerant
   Gastropoda and Ostracoda at the unfenced spring. Copyright (c) 2010 John

   communities}},
Journal = {{FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Some plant functional traits evolved with high temporal resource
   variability and disturbance in ecosystems where these factors are
   prevalent. Persistence of characteristics of these functional traits in
   ecosystems may depend on continued resource variability and disturbance,
   which in turn may promote functional diversity. In Mediterranean
   ecosystems, experiments that eliminate temporal resource variability and
   disturbance are needed to detect functional trait dependence on these
   factors. 2. The purpose of this study was to experimentally assess how
   interannual rainfall variability, summer drought and seasonal grazing
   modify the characteristics of functional traits (life span, flowering
   time, seed size and plant size) in old-field (615 years) Mediterranean
   herbaceous communities. 3. We designed a 9-year factorial field
   experiment that manipulated Mediterranean rainfall variability in three
   ways: (i) constant water availability with no summer drought; (ii)
   autumn and spring water availability but with summer drought; and (iii)
   no water supplied to rainfall; and grazing regimes: (i) autumn grazing;
   (ii) spring grazing; and (iii) non-grazing, in each of the three
   scenarios of water availability. At a community scale, we measured
   abundance of different categories within four plant functional traits:
   plant life span (annual and perennial), flowering time of annuals
   (spring and summer) and seed and plant sizes of spring annuals (small
   and large). 4. Interannual rainfall variability in autumn and spring
   (IRVAS), summer drought and grazing reduced perennial cover. IRVAS was
   necessary for the persistence of small-seeded and small-size spring
   annuals. IRVAS and summer drought increased spring annuals in grazed
   treatments. 5. Results suggest that IRVAS, summer drought and grazing
   favour the coexistence of species, through improved functional diversity
   in seed and plant sizes and increased abundance of spring annuals, the
   most species-rich functional group. Both effects may be the reason for
   the high species richness in grazed Mediterranean herbaceous
   communities.}},

Abstract = {{Although acoustic recordings have recently gained popularity as an
   alternative to point counts for surveying birds, little is known about
   the relative performance of the two methods for detecting tropical bird
   species across multiple vegetation types. During June and July 2008, we
   collected species detection/nondetection data to compare the performance
   of a quadraphonic acoustic recording system and point counts for
   estimating species richness and composition and detection probabilities
   of 15 rare, moderately common, and common tropical bird species across
   six structurally distinct vegetation types (coastal dune scrub,
   mangrove, low-stature deciduous thorn forest, early and late
   successional medium-stature semievergreen forest, and grazed pastures)
   in the northern Yucatan Peninsula. We selected five rare species endemic
   to the Yucatan Peninsula and 10 moderately common and common species
   that also occur in other tropical regions. Species richness and
   composition did not differ between survey methods in any of the
   vegetation types. At the population level, however, we found support for
   an effect of method on detection probability for most species. For 13
   species, regardless of their abundance, acoustic recordings yielded
   detection probabilities as high as or higher than those for point counts
   across all vegetation types. The remaining two species were better
   detected by point counts in pastures and coastal scrub, where greater
   visibility likely improved sightings of these species. However, these
   species were detected as well as or better by acoustic recordings in
   forests and mangroves where detections were primarily auditory. In
   tropical regions where experienced field observers may not be available
   and funding for field surveys may be limited, acoustic recordings offer
   a practical solution for determining species richness and composition
   and the occupancy patterns of most species. However, for some species, a
   combination of methods will provide the most reliable data. Regardless
   of the method selected, analyses that account for variation in detection
   probability among vegetation types will be necessary because most
   species in our study demonstrated vegetation-dependent detection
   probabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Heterospecific neighbors may reduce damage to a focal plant by lowering
   specialist herbivore loads (associational resistance hypothesis), or
   enhance damage by increasing generalist herbivore loads (associational
   susceptibility hypothesis). We tested the associational effects of tree
   diversity on herbivory patterns of the tropical focal tree in an
   experimental plantation setup, which contained tree monocultures and
   mixed stands. We found higher herbivore damage to at higher tree
   diversity, indicating that did not benefit from associational resistance
   but rather experienced associational susceptibility. The specific
   consideration of the two dominant insect herbivore species of , the
   specialist chrysomelid and the specialist pyralid , facilitated
   understanding of the detected damage patterns Tree diversity exerted
   opposite effects on tree infestation by the two herbivores. These
   findings point to resource concentration effects for the chrysomelid
   beetle (favored by tree monoculture) and to resource dilution effects
   for the pyralid caterpillar (favored by tree mixture) as underlying
   mechanisms of herbivore distribution. A strong contribution of the
   pyralid to overall damage patterns in diversified stands suggests that
   associational susceptibility may not necessarily be related to higher
   abundances of generalist herbivores but may also result from specialized
   herbivores affected by resource dilution effects. Thus, the identity and
   biology of herbivore species has to be taken into account when
   attempting to predict damage patterns in forest ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerated tropical landscape changes occurring over recent decades
   have produced environmental mosaics comprising remaining isolated green
   areas and mixed land-use types. Our objective was to study the effects
   of alterations in the natural landscape on the species composition and
   structure of assemblages of Asteraceae and their endophagous insects
   through comparisons between cerrado (savanna), pastures and Eucalyptus
   stands. We first investigated whether similarities between assemblages
   of Asteraceae and their insects varied among land uses or localities.
   Secondly, we asked whether assemblages of Eucalyptus stands and pastures
   are subsets of those within the cerrado. We sampled within randomly
   deployed transects in 15 areas. Land use was found to be an important
   factor in determining plant composition similarity; however, locality
   did not exert any significant influence. Pastures were less similar to
   one another, suggesting high beta diversity. Similarities among insect
   assemblages were correlated with plant assemblage composition, but not
   with land use or locality. Species of Tephritidae were distributed along
   localities independently of land use. High beta diversity in Asteraceae
   assemblages among cerrados and pastures was supported by nestedness
   analysis. Plant assemblages in Eucalyptus stands were subsets of
   cerrado, but pasture assemblages were only partial subsets. A higher
   degree of nestedness in insect assemblages than in plant assemblages
   indicated lower beta diversity within these herbivores. Our data
   indicate that many herbivores are specialized on widely distributed
   plant genera. Conservation of Asteraceae species and their flower head
   insects depends not only on maintenance of landscape fragments but also
   on the correct matching of management form and land use. Such management
   may contribute to reducing isolation of plant and insect species by
   increasing the connectivity of remaining cerrado tracts, allowing
   population maintenance even at low abundances.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification is a major driver of global environmental
   change. Disentangling the relative impact of losses in plant species
   richness and intensified management on higher trophic level organisms is
   important for conservation recommendations.
   We established different management regimes along an experimental
   gradient of plant species richness within ``The Jena-Experiment{''} in
   Germany and quantified herbivory as well as grasshoppers and
   pollinators. Herbivory, grasshopper density and species richness and
   frequency of flower visiting pollinators were recorded two times in each
   of four subplots of altogether 80 plots differing in plant species
   richness. Each of the four subplots was subject to four different levels
   of fertilizer application and mowing to simulate very low, low, high and
   very high land use intensity.
   Fertilization and mowing significantly affected plant-herbivore
   interactions but plant species richness had no discernible effect.
   Grasshoppers were most abundant at high intensity subplots (3.1
   individuals per m(2)) and least abundant on very low intensity subplots
   (1.3 individuals per m(2)). Leaf damage caused by herbivores was highest
   in even the very high intensity subplots (3.7\%) with four mowing events
   per year and high amounts of fertilizer application and lowest on
   subplots with a low management intensity (2.4\%) comprising two mowing
   events per year but no fertilizer application. In contrast, pollinators
   benefited most from lower management intensities, with only one or two
   mowing events and no fertilizer addition. In addition, higher numbers of
   flowering plant species and increased blossom cover was associated with
   enhanced pollinator species richness and flower visitation.
   Our results indicate that even in grasslands with high plant species
   richness, mowing and fertilization are more important drivers of
   herbivory and flower visitation by pollinators. Management with no more
   than two cuts per year and without fertilizer application in our
   grasslands balanced the ecosystem functions of increased pollination and
   decreased herbivory. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the increasing evidence that post-mining sites often provide
   biodiversity refuges in anthropogenically impacted landscapes, thus
   offering valuable analogues of natural habitats, technocratic methods
   still prevail over natural processes in restoration practice. Selection
   of the restoration approach, however, crucially affects the future
   conservation value of every site. As a contribution to recent debates,
   we studied the communities of vascular plants and seven arthropod groups
   (orthopteroids, spiders, leafhoppers, ground beetles, herbivorous
   beetles, true bugs, and butterflies and moths) colonising technically
   reclaimed versus spontaneously developed plots on black coal spoil dumps
   in the Kladno district, Czech Republic. In all studied groups,
   spontaneously developed sites hosted a high proportion of species of
   conservation concern, which were nearly absent from the technically
   reclaimed plots. Combined with existing single-taxon studies of diverse
   post-mining sites, and our previous similarly broad study of limestone
   quarries, our results provide strong evidence of the counterproductivity
   of costly technical reclamations of postindustrial sites with respect to
   biodiversity conservation. Relevant legislation should favour natural
   processes over technical reclamation when deciding the fates of
   post-mining localities. Technical reclamation should be reserved just
   for those cases of well-justified public concerns. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The effects of exotic species invasions on biodiversity vary with
   spatial scale, and documentation of local-scale changes in biodiversity
   following invasion is generally lacking. Coupling long-term observations
   of local community dynamics with experiments to determine the role
   played by exotic species in recruitment limitation of native species
   would inform both our understanding of exotic impacts on natives at
   local scales and regional-scale management efforts to promote native
   persistence. We used field experimentation to quantify propagule and
   establishment limitation in a suite of native annual forbs in a
   California reserve, and compared these findings to species abundance
   trends within the same sites over the past 48 years. Observations at 11
   paired sites (inside and outside the reserve) indicated that exotic
   annual plants have continued to increase in abundance over the past 48
   years. This trend suggests the system has not reached equilibrium >250
   years after exotic species began to spread, and 70 years after livestock
   grazing ceased within the reserve. Long-term monitoring observations
   also indicated that six native annual forb species went extinct from
   more local populations than were colonized. To determine the potential
   role of exotic species in these native plant declines, we added seed of
   these species into plots adjacent to monitoring sites where plant litter
   and live grass competition were removed. Experimental results suggest
   both propagule and establishment limitation have contributed to local
   declines observed for these native forbs. Recruitment was highest at
   sites that had current or historical occurrences of the seeded species,
   and in plots where litter was removed. Grazing history (i.e., location
   within or outside the reserve) interacted with exotic competition
   removal, such that removal of live grass competition increased
   recruitment in more recently grazed sites. Abundance of forbs was
   positively related to recruitment, while abundance of exotic forbs was
   negatively related. Thus, exotic competition is likely only one factor
   contributing to local declines of native species in invaded ecosystems,
   with a combination of propagule limitation, site quality, and land use
   history also playing important and interactive roles in native plant
   recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{The Picos de Europa are a range of predominantly Carboniferous Limestone
   and Sandstone mountains mainly in the Cantabrian region of northern
   Spain. The highest peaks are precipitous and reach 2600 m. There are
   complex gradients between Lusitanian, Alpine and Mediterranean
   environmental zones, as well as variable soil types. In combination with
   the long history of traditional agricultural management, a wide range of
   diverse habitats and species is present. The herb-rich hay meadows have
   long been recognised as having a high nature conservation value but, as
   elsewhere in European mountains, such grasslands are threatened by
   changing agricultural practices. Accordingly, in 1993, 92 quadrats were
   recorded using a restricted list of indicator species from stratified
   random samples. The authors repeated the sample in 2009. Changed land
   use had only occurred in approximately 3\% of meadows, however, farmyard
   manure was no longer used, probably because of shortage of labour.
   Statistical analysis of the vegetation data showed a range of
   significant changes consistent with the increased use of slurry, as well
   as re-seeding of some fields. The grass swards had not only become
   denser, with fewer species present, but there was also a loss of
   sensitive indicators especially of calcareous conditions and open
   vegetation. By contrast, competitors had increased and the vegetation
   had become simpler, with the balance of vegetation types shifting to
   more nutrient rich conditions. These changes have mainly occurred in the
   more fertile meadows used for silage. The core of about 35\% of
   herb-rich meadows, mainly cut for hay, has remained relatively stable
   but the results show that they are at risk if the current trend
   continues. If management practices that form the core of traditional
   agriculture are not maintained, one of the most important resources of
   herb-rich meadows in Europe will be lost. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{Questions: How do fire and grazing by bison affect the composition and
   structure of tallgrass prairie plant communities and their temporal
   stability? Are these responsesmodulated by topographic location?
   Location: Konza Prairie Biological Station, Kansas, USA. Methods: Plant
   community composition was monitored in permanent plots in native
   grassland sites receiving different long-term prescribed burning and
   bison grazing regimes across a topographic gradient (lowlands, slopes,
   uplands) following 20 yr of variable burning treatments and 13 yr of
   grazing by bison. A combination of multivariate analyses was used to
   determine how community structure, life forms and individual species
   responded to the accumulated effects of long-termfire and grazing by
   native bison in upland, slope and lowland soils. Results: Species
   diversity wasmaximized in sites that were infrequently burned and grazed
   by bison with the strongest response on infrequently burned slope sites,
   while diversity was lowest on frequently burned ungrazed sites and on
   frequently burned slope sites. In general, grass cover was highest in
   infrequently burned ungrazed sites and lowest on frequently burned
   grazed sites, while forb richness was highest in infrequently burned and
   grazed sites. Community response to fire and grazing differed across the
   topographic gradient. In general, frequent burning favoured C4 grasses,
   which reduced the abundance of C3 forbs, especially in lowland sites.
   Responses of dominant grasses and forbs to fire and grazing varied
   depending on topographic position. Community stability was positively
   correlated with species richness. Conclusions: Overall, we found that
   fire and grazing are themain determinants of plant community composition
   and structure in this grassland system, but that topography mediates
   these effects. A combination of bison grazing and periodic fire is
   necessary to maximize diversity and community stability across this
   native grassland landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Phalaris arundinacea (reed canarygrass) is recognized as a problematic
   invader of North American marshes, decreasing biodiversity and
   persisting in the face of control efforts. Less is known about its
   ecology or management in forested wetlands, providing an opportunity to
   apply information about factors critical to an invader's control in one
   wetland type to another. In a potted plant experiment and in the field,
   we documented strong competitive effects of reed canarygrass on the
   establishment and early growth of tree seedlings. In the field, we
   demonstrated the effectiveness of a novel restoration strategy,
   combining site scarification with late fall applications of pre-emergent
   herbicides. Treatments delayed reed canarygrass emergence the following
   spring, creating a window of opportunity for the early growth of native
   plants in the absence of competition from the grass. They also allowed
   for follow-up herbicide treatments during the growing season. We
   documented greater establishment of wetland herbs and tree seedlings in
   treated areas. Data from small exclosures suggest, however, that deer
   browsing can limit tree seedling height growth in floodplain
   restorations. Slower tree growth will delay canopy closure, potentially
   allowing reed canarygrass re-invasion. Thus, it may be necessary to
   protect tree seedlings from herbivory to assure forest regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1960s, Japan has become highly dependent on foreign countries
   for natural resources, and the amount of managed lands (e.g. coppice,
   grassland, and agricultural field) has declined. Due to infrequent
   natural and human disturbance, early-successional species are now
   declining in Japan. Here we surveyed bees, birds, and plants in four
   human-disturbed open habitats (pasture, meadow, young planted forest,
   and abandoned clear-cut) and two forest habitats (mature planted forest
   and natural old-growth). We extended a recently developed multispecies
   abundance model to accommodate count data, and used the resulting models
   to estimate species-, functional group-, and community-level state
   variables (abundance and species richness) at each site, and compared
   them among the six habitats. Estimated individual-level detection
   probability was quite low for bee species (mean across species = 0.003;
   0.16 for birds). Thirty-two (95\% credible interval: 13-64) and one
   (0-4) bee and bird species, respectively, were suggested to be
   undetected by the field survey. Although habitats in which
   community-level abundance and species richness was highest differed
   among taxa, species richness and abundance of early-successional species
   were similar in the four disturbed open habitats across taxa except for
   plants in the pasture habitat which was a good habitat only for several
   exotic species. Our results suggest that human disturbance, especially
   the revival of plantation forestry, may contribute to the restoration of
   early-successional species in Japan.}},

Abstract = {{Agri-environment scheme (AES) management has increased populations of
   cirl buntings (Emberiza cirlus) in South Devon, England, and might be
   expected to provide benefits for other declining biodiversity, due to
   less intensive farm management. Fields managed under AES for cirl
   buntings (low-input spring barley or permanent pasture without inputs)
   were contrasted with control fields under conventional management
   (spring barley without management restrictions and winter cereals, or
   grazed without management restrictions) to identify such benefits for
   vascular plants, butterflies, bumblebees, carabid beetles, foliar
   invertebrates and bats. Activity-density and species richness of carabid
   beetles were both higher in AES spring barley fields than in control
   spring barley and winter cereal fields. Forb cover and abundance of
   butterflies and bumblebees were higher in AES spring barley fields than
   in winter cereals, but did not differ between AES and control spring
   barley. No difference was observed in plant species richness between any
   of the arable field types. Plant species richness and butterfly
   abundance were higher in AES pasture fields than in controls. Abundance,
   activity-density and/or species richness of other taxa did not differ
   between AES and control pastures. Benefits observed in AES spring barley
   fields arise from management specific to AES agreements, and also, we
   suggest, from the maintenance of spring-sown barley in the landscape.
   Benefits in AES pasture fields are ascribed to the absence of fertiliser
   and pesticide inputs, and reductions in stocking arising from this;
   there is also likely to have been some pre-selection for older pastures
   to be entered into AES management agreements. Agri-environment measures
   for cirl buntings have benefits for a range of taxa beyond the target
   species, and therefore, largely through reduction of management
   intensity and maintenance of land-use diversity, improve the overall
   biodiversity of the farmed landscape where they are present.}},

Abstract = {{Ecology Letters (2012) Abstract Anthropogenic perturbations may affect
   biodiversity and ecological stability as well as their relationships.
   However, diversitystability patterns and associated mechanisms under
   human disturbances have rarely been explored. We conducted a 7-year
   field experiment examining the effects of mowing and nutrient addition
   on the diversity and temporal stability of herbaceous plant communities
   in a temperate steppe in northern China. Mowing increased population and
   community stability, whereas nutrient addition had the opposite effects.
   Stability exhibited positive relationships with species richness at
   population, functional group and community levels. Treatments did not
   alter these positive diversitystability relationships, which were
   associated with the stabilising effect of species richness on component
   populations, species asynchrony and portfolio effects. Despite the
   difficulty of pinpointing causal mechanisms of diversitystability
   patterns observed in nature, our results suggest that diversity may
   still be a useful predictor of the stability of ecosystems confronted

Title = {{Grassland Resistance and Resilience after Drought Depends on Management

Abstract = {{The degree to which biodiversity may promote the stability of grasslands
   in the light of climatic variability, such as prolonged summer drought,
   has attracted considerable interest. Studies so far yielded inconsistent
   results and in addition, the effect of different grassland management
   practices on their response to drought remains an open question. We
   experimentally combined the manipulation of prolonged summer drought
   (sheltered vs. unsheltered sites), plant species loss (6 levels of 60
   down to 1 species) and management intensity (4 levels varying in mowing
   frequency and amount of fertilizer application). Stability was measured
   as resistance and resilience of aboveground biomass production in
   grasslands against decreased summer precipitation, where resistance is
   the difference between drought treatments directly after drought
   induction and resilience is the difference between drought treatments in
   spring of the following year. We hypothesized that (i) management
   intensification amplifies biomass decrease under drought, (ii)
   resistance decreases with increasing species richness and with
   management intensification and (iii) resilience increases with
   increasing species richness and with management intensification.
   We found that resistance and resilience of grasslands to summer drought
   are highly dependent on management intensity and partly on species
   richness. Frequent mowing reduced the resistance of grasslands against
   drought and increasing species richness decreased resistance in one of
   our two study years. Resilience was positively related to species
   richness only under the highest management treatment. We conclude that
   low mowing frequency is more important for high resistance against
   drought than species richness. Nevertheless, species richness increased
   aboveground productivity in all management treatments both under drought
   and ambient conditions and should therefore be maintained under future
   climates.}},

Title = {{Does Cattle Grazing Affect Ant Abundance and Diversity in Temperate

Volume = {{65}},

Abstract = {{Half of the world's land base is grazed by domesticated livestock.
   Because of the important functional role of ants in grasslands, it is
   important to understand the effect of livestock grazing on ant abundance
   and diversity. The objectives of this study were to examine the effect
   of cattle grazing and site productivity on the abundance, species
   richness, and species diversity of ants in Lac du Bois Grasslands
   Provincial Park, British Columbia, Canada. We hypothesized that the
   measured ant variables would be lowest in grazed areas and at low site
   productivity. Pitfall trapping was conducted at four sites: two at each
   low and high site productivity levels. At each site an ungrazed (fenced
   exclosure) and grazed transect was sampled during May, July, and August
   of 2008. Captured ants were preserved in ethanol and identified. Eight
   genuses of ants were collected: Tapinoma, Camponotus, Formica, Lasius,
   Aphaenogaster, Myrmica, Solinopsis, and Temnotharox. The mean number of
   ants per pitfall was higher at high site productivity sites that were
   grazed (15.10 +/- 2.96 SE) compared to high productivity sites ungrazed
   (3.28 +/- 0.47 SE); grazing at low productivity reduced numbers of ants
   from 5.07 (+/- 0.70 SE) to 2.20 (+/- 0.39 SE) (F = 21.806; P < 0.001).
   Tapinoma sessile and A. occidentalis had the greatest numbers in the
   pitfall traps. Species richness (F = 23.330, P < 0.001) and diversity (F
   = 11.764, P = 0.001) followed a similar trend. Because productivity and
   cattle grazing affect ant diversity and abundance, and ants impact
   ecosystem functioning, these factors should be considered in management
   of grasslands.}},

Title = {{Predicting plant traits and functional types response to grazing in an

Journal = {{SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{The identification of easily measured plant functional types (PFTs) that
   consistently predict grazing response would be a major advance. The
   responses to grazing of individual traits and PFTs were analyzed along a
   grazing gradient in an alpine shrub meadow on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
   China. Three response types were identified; grazing increaser (GI),
   grazing decreaser (GD), and neutral (NE) for both traits and PFTs. Seven
   traits were measured: plant height, economic group, cotyledon type,
   plant inclination, growth form, life cycle, and vegetative structure.
   The first five were significantly affected by grazing. Ordinal
   regressions for grazing response of the seven traits showed that the
   best single predictors of response were growth form (including the
   attributes ``Scattered{''}, ``Bunched{''} or ``Closely Bunched{''}), and
   plant inclination ({''}Rosette{''}, ``Prostrate{''}, or ``Erect{''}),
   followed by economic group ({''}Shrub{''}, ``Grass{''}, ``Sedge{''},
   ``Legume{''}, ``Forb{''}, or ``Harmful{''}) and plant height
   ({''}Tall{''}, ``Medium{''}, or ``Small{''}). Within the four optimal
   traits, the summed dominance ratio (SDR) of small plants, forbs, rosette
   and bunched plants, invariably increased, while that of tall plants,
   shrubs, grasses, and erect plants decreased, when grazing pressure was
   enhanced. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) identified eleven
   explanatory PFTs based on 195 defined PFTs, by combining the different
   attributes of the four optimal traits. Among explanatory PFTs, the most
   valuable in predicting the community response to grazing were
   TallxShrubxErectxScattered and SmallxForbxRosette, as these have the
   closest connections with grazing disturbance and include fewer species.
   Species richness, diversity, and community evenness, did not differ
   among grazing treatments because turnover occurred in component species
   and their relative abundances along the grazing gradient. We have
   demonstrated that a minimum set of PFTs resulting from optimal
   individual traits can provide consistent prediction of community
   responses to grazing in this region. This approach provides a more
   accurate indicator of change within a changing environment than do
   univariate measures of species diversity. We hope to provide a link
   between management practices and vegetation structure, forming a basis
   for future, large scale, plant trait comparisons.}},

Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{Traditional approaches to the study of species persistence in fragmented
   landscapes generally consider a binary classification of habitat being
   suitable or unsuitable; however, the range of human-modified habitats
   within a region may offer a gradient of habitat suitability (or
   conservation value) for species. We identified such a gradient by
   comparing bird assemblages among contrasting land uses (pine plantations
   of different age, annual crops, clear cuts and cattle pastures) in the
   Upper Parana Atlantic forest. Bird assemblages and vegetation structure
   were characterized in an extensive area of 4400 km(2) in Argentina and
   Paraguay during the breeding seasons of 2005-2010. Similarity of bird
   assemblages between anthropogenic habitats and the native forest and the
   proportion of forest species increased with vegetation vertical
   structure, while the proportion of open-area species decreased. As a
   consequence, mature tree plantations were the most suitable habitats for
   forest species and were mainly used by frugivores and bark insectivores.
   In contrast, open habitats were the least suitable habitat for forest
   species and were used primarily by insectivores. Human-created habitats
   that are structurally complex can be used by a subset of forest species,
   and may improve functional connectivity and mitigate edge effects. The
   conservation of large tracks of native forests, however, is critical for
   the long-term persistence of the entire bird assemblage, especially for
   native forest dependent species.}},

Volume = {{152}},
Pages = {{27-32}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyses changes in species richness and functional trait
   diversity in response to grazing abandonment in Mediterranean
   grasslands, for five traits that are well connected to ecosystem
   function and community assembly: Plant Height, Specific Leaf Area, Seed
   Mass, Onset of Flowering and Growth Form. The impacts of land-use change
   on floristic composition and community weighted traits were measured
   along with soil fertility, bare soil cover and litter cover. Results
   reveal changes in the community average value of all analysed plant
   functional traits and a loss of functional diversity after abandonment
   in two of them, which is not accompanied by a change in species
   richness, indicating a loss of functional groups and a potential effect
   on the ecosystem functioning.
   Abandonment is accompanied by the disappearance of short species,
   prostrate or creeper growth forms and early flowering species, while
   tall species and graminoid forms increase, their greater inflammability
   predicting an increase in wildfire frequency and intensity. Seed Mass
   and Specific Leaf Area show a weak but significant signal, with
   abandonment favoring large-seeded species and small Specific Leaf Area.
   A decline in soil fertility after abandonment is also detected, probably
   related to the decreased nutrient recycling rate and litter
   decomposability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   was to test whether organic farming enhances local plant species
   richness in both crop and non-crop areas of vineyard farms located in
   intensive conventional landscapes. Nine conventional and nine organic
   farms were selected in an intensively cultivated region (i.e. no
   gradient in landscape composition) in northern Italy. In each farm,
   vascular plants were sampled in one vineyard and in two non-crop linear
   habitats, grass strips and hedgerows, adjacent to vineyards and
   therefore potentially influenced by farming. We used linear mixed models
   to test the effect of farming, and species longevity (annual vs.
   perennial) separately for the three habitat types. In our intensive
   agricultural landscapes organic farming promoted local plant species
   richness in vineyard fields, and grassland strips while we found no
   effect for linear hedgerows. Differences in species richness were not
   associated to differences in species composition, indicating that
   similar plant communities were hosted in vineyard farms independently of
   the management type. This negative effect of conventional farming was
   probably due to the use of herbicides, while mechanical operations and
   mowing regime did not differ between organic and conventional farms. In
   grassland strips, and only marginally in vineyards, we found that the
   positive effect of organic farming was more pronounced for perennial
   than annual species.}},

Abstract = {{Removal of shrubs and trees is an important management and restoration
   practice to promote openness and light-dependent vegetation in fens,
   especially as tree cover is increasing in previously open wetlands. The
   effects of woody vegetation removal on target species have been poorly
   documented in wetlands up to now. In this study, I investigated the
   effect of tree and shrub removal (especially of Juniperus communis) on
   the target vegetation in a partly overgrown and degraded grazed rich fen
   after 6 years. I also tested whether additional intensified management
   by mowing could promote initial recovery. Shrub removal resulted in a
   rapid recovery of species-rich fen vegetation such that after 6 years
   brown moss cover more than tripled and target species richness doubled
   and became similar to values of a reference area in a favorable
   conservation status. Additional mowing resulted in a much higher
   abundance of the target rich fen vascular plants. The reasons for the
   success at this site may be the proximity to well-developed rich fen
   vegetation, presence of cattle that dispersed diaspores, and presence of
   bare, colonizable substrate. Thus, it may be more beneficial to restore
   and expand already existing sites in a partly favorable status than to
   restore severely deteriorated sites. Extensive management by woody
   vegetation removal may be an alternative method to maintain high
   conservation values of open mires and other wetlands, where grazing or
   mowing is not necessary or feasible to meet future needs in response to
   overgrowth caused by global warming.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Dominance by free-floating plants results in a loss of plant species in
   many waters. An important source for re-establishment of non-floating
   aquatic plants can be the propagule bank. This study focuses on whether
   the propagule bank of free-floating plantdominated ditch sediments can
   serve as potential source for recovery of a diverse plant community. The
   first objective was to determine differences in propagule germination
   from sediments of ditches in the Netherlands that differ in vegetation
   composition through a seedling-emergence experiment. The second
   objective was to analyze the effect of sediment disturbance on the
   number of germinating propagules. The results show that, compared to
   sediments from ditches with submerged vegetation, sediments from
   free-floating plantdominated ditches produced significantly lower
   numbers of individuals and species of submerged and emergent plants,
   while numbers of individuals and species of free-floating plants were
   higher. These results suggest that sediments from free-floating
   plantdominated ditches have lower potential to recover a diverse plant
   community probably resulting from positive feedback mechanisms caused by
   the vegetation present, maintaining the free-floating plantdominated
   state. Sediment disturbance strongly favors the germination of
   free-floating plant propagules, especially from free-floating
   plantdominated ditch sediments. Ditch maintenance activities such as
   mowing and dredging will therefore likely favor persistence of the
   free-floating plantdominated state. To shift from dominance by
   free-floating plants to a more diverse plant community, alternative
   maintenance methods should be considered that cause less sediment
   disturbance together with measures that promote colonization such as
   temporary drawdown or re-introduction of species.}},

Journal = {{DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Aim Promoting population growth of genetically distinct subpopulations
   of Cape mountain zebra (Equus zebra zebra) is crucial to the survival of
   the subspecies. Several important Cape mountain zebra reserves are
   dominated by fynbos vegetation, and population growth is limited by a
   lack of grassland habitat. A fossil ungulate sequence spanning the last
   c. 18,000 years is examined to understand the long-term history of this
   conservation challenge.
   Location Boomplaas Cave (BPA), South Africa.
   Methods The fossil sequence from BPA is examined to reconstruct ungulate
   community dynamics in relation to climate and vegetation change over the
   last 18,000 years.
   Results Ungulates from 18,000 to 12,000 years ago suggest an expansion
   of open grasslands that supported a grazing ecosystem dominated by an
   extinct caprine antelope and equid remains attributed to E. zebra and E.
   quagga. At the onset of the Holocene, the grazing ungulate community
   disappears and small browsers and mixed feeders dominate the assemblage,
   indicating the loss of open grassland vegetation. Several open- habitat
   grazers go extinct at this time, and Equus persists at much lower
   abundances. This shift can be explained by global climate change across
   the Pleistocene- Holocene transition.
   Main conclusions The fossil sequence supports contemporary observations
   indicating that access to open grassland is crucial to maintaining large
   Cape mountain zebra subpopulations. Although fynbos is abundant
   throughout the historic range of the Cape mountain zebra, fossil
   evidence suggests that such vegetation is unlikely to support dense
   populations. It has been suggested that the acquisition of agricultural
   lands that were historically converted to open grasslands for livestock
   could promote Cape mountain zebra population growth. Results presented
   here support this management option, as the open grasslands in these
   converted landscapes likely approximate the vegetation structure during
   latest Pleistocene, when grasslands were widespread and grazing
   ungulates abundant.}},

Title = {{Which plant traits determine abundance under long-term shifts in soil
   resource availability and grazing intensity?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{100}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{662-677}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{1. Soil resource availability and disturbance are widely recognized as
   key drivers of plant community structure. However, the relative
   importance of different plant traits in determining species abundance
   following shifts in soil resource availability and disturbance remains
   little studied, particularly in long-term experiments.
   2. We studied trait-based plant community assembly in a 27-year
   grassland experiment where 25 plant species were sown into resident
   vegetation, after which annual manipulations of soil resource
   availability (five levels of superphosphate fertilizer; the highest
   level was also irrigated) and disturbance (three `mob-grazed' sheep
   grazing intensity levels: lax, moderate, hard) were applied. We used
   community assembly through trait selection (CATS) models based on
   entropy maximization to predict species relative abundances and to
   quantify the relative importance of each trait in determining abundance.
   3. Plant species were primarily differentiated along a trade-off axis
   corresponding to traits promoting rapid growth (e. g. high leaf {[}N]
   and specific leaf area {[}SLA]) vs. those promoting long leaf life span.
   Using 12 traits, the CATS model predicted >80\% of the variation in the
   relative abundances of 51 species, suggesting that trait-based filtering
   was important.
   4. Species with leaf attributes that reduce nutrient losses held a
   long-term advantage under the lowest soil resource availability, whereas
   those associated with a rapid growth rate became dominant under soil
   resource addition. Species with thinner leaves were also favoured under
   greater soil resource availability, which may reflect a strategy to
   maximize SLA without sacrificing leaf density and thus maintain leaf
   structural defences under grazing disturbance. Greater leaf {[}S] and
   the ability to symbiotically fix atmospheric N were favoured under
   greater soil resource availability. Greater plant height, thinner leaves
   and higher leaf {[}N] were favoured under lower grazing intensity.
   5. Synthesis. Our results highlight the importance of species functional
   differences to understand how plant communities react to increases in
   soil resource availability and disturbance, two important and
   inseparable components of land-use change in grasslands world-wide.}},

Title = {{The importance of grasslands for animal production and other functions:
   a review on management and methodological progress in the tropics}},
Journal = {{ANIMAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{748-762}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The global importance of grasslands is indicated by their extent; they
   comprise some 26\% of total land area and 80\% of agriculturally
   productive land. The majority of grasslands are located in tropical
   developing countries where they are particularly important to the
   livelihoods of some one billion poor peoples. Grasslands clearly provide
   the feed base for grazing livestock and thus numerous high-quality
   foods, but such livestock also provide products such as fertilizer,
   transport, traction, fibre and leather. In addition, grasslands provide
   important services and roles including as water catchments, biodiversity
   reserves, for cultural and recreational needs, and potentially a carbon
   sink to alleviate greenhouse gas emissions. Inevitably, such functions
   may conflict with management for production of livestock products. Much
   of the increasing global demand for meat and milk, particularly from
   developing countries, will have to be supplied from grassland
   ecosystems, and this will provide difficult challenges. Increased
   production of meat and milk generally requires increased intake of
   metabolizable energy, and thus increased voluntary intake and/or
   digestibility of diets selected by grazing animals. These will require
   more widespread and effective application of improved management.
   Strategies to improve productivity include fertilizer application,
   grazing management, greater use of crop by-products, legumes and
   supplements and manipulation of stocking rate and herbage allowance.
   However, it is often difficult to predict the efficiency and
   cost-effectiveness of such strategies, particularly in tropical
   developing country production systems. Evaluation and on-going
   adjustment of grazing systems require appropriate and reliable
   assessment criteria, but these are often lacking. A number of emerging
   technologies may contribute to timely low-cost acquisition of
   quantitative information to better understand the soil-pasture-animal
   interactions and animal management in grassland systems. Development of
   remote imaging of vegetation, global positioning technology, improved
   diet markers, near IR spectroscopy and modelling provide improved tools
   for knowledge-based decisions on the productivity constraints of grazing
   animals. Individual electronic identification of animals offers
   opportunities for precision management on an individual animal basis for
   improved productivity. Improved outcomes in the form of livestock
   products, services and/or other outcomes from grasslands should be
   possible, but clearly a diversity of solutions are needed for the vast
   range of environments and social circumstances of global grasslands.}},

Title = {{Is New Zealand vegetation really problematic'? Dansereau's puzzles
   revisited}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{367-389}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Over four decades ago, Pierre Dansereau, the noted North American
   ecologist, proposed six features of New Zealand vegetation as being
   problematic or unusual in a global context. We examine his propositions
   in the light of current ecological knowledge to determine whether or not
   these can still be considered unusual characteristics of New Zealand
   vegetation.
   1) `Climatic change is still progressing'resulting in disequilibrium
   between species'distributions and the present climate. New data and
   methods of analysis now available have removed the impression that
   Dansereau gained of imprecise zonation, unclear vegetation/ climate
   relations and missing vegetation types. Communities cited as having
   regeneration failure can now be seen as even- aged stands that developed
   after major disturbance, although there are other, also non- climatic,
   explanations. However, the cause of the Westland `Nothofagus gap'has
   become more, rather than less, controversial.
   (2) `Continuity of community composition defies classification'and `Very
   few New Zealand associations have faithful species'are correct
   observations, but perhaps equally true of vegetation elsewhere.
   Dansereau's assertion of low species richness in New Zealand is not
   supported by the comparative data available.
   (3) `Lack of intolerant {[} i. e. mid- seral] trees...'is not evident
   with newer information. The order of species in succession, seen as
   unclear by Dansereau, has been determined by a range of approaches,
   largely confirming each other.
   (4) `Discrepancies of form and function...'in divaricate shrubs and
   widespread heteroblasty are still controversial, with many more
   explanations. Several abiotic explanations have failed to stand up to
   investigation. Explanations in terms of herbivory have been well
   supported, although the extinction of the large avian herbivores makes
   certainty impossible.
   (5) `Incidence of hybridization...'remains problematic. We do not know
   whether the incidence is unusually high, as Dansereau alleged, but the
   limited comparative data available suggest not.
   (6) The `overwhelming... competing power of exotics'is strongly context
   dependent. They are prominent in many non- forest habitats. It seems
   that they are drivers of the vegetation change in some habitats, yet
   passengers after disturbance in others. Invasions can be slow, and may
   still be very incomplete in some ecosystem types. Whether exotics will
   eventually take over in most communities, or whether the native species
   will `laugh them to scorn'as Cockayne suggested, only time will tell. In
   conclusion, some aspects of New Zealand's vegetation seem less unusual
   with increased knowledge, but others remain `problems'.}},

Title = {{Unravelling Soil Fungal Communities from Different Mediterranean
   Land-Use Backgrounds}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fungi strongly influence ecosystem structure and
   functioning, playing a key role in many ecological services as
   decomposers, plant mutualists and pathogens. The Mediterranean area is a
   biodiversity hotspot that is increasingly threatened by intense land
   use. Therefore, to achieve a balance between conservation and human
   development, a better understanding of the impact of land use on the
   underlying fungal communities is needed.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We used parallel pyrosequencing of the
   nuclear ribosomal ITS regions to characterize the fungal communities in
   five soils subjected to different anthropogenic impact in a typical
   Mediterranean landscape: a natural cork-oak forest, a pasture, a managed
   meadow, and two vineyards. Marked differences in the distribution of
   taxon assemblages among the different sites and communities were found.
   Data analyses consistently indicated a sharp distinction of the fungal
   community of the cork oak forest soil from those described in the other
   soils. Each soil showed features of the fungal assemblages retrieved
   which can be easily related to the above-ground settings:
   ectomycorrhizal phylotypes were numerous in natural sites covered by
   trees, but were nearly completely missing from the anthropogenic and
   grass-covered sites; similarly, coprophilous fungi were common in grazed
   sites.
   Conclusions/Significance: Data suggest that investigation on the
   below-ground fungal community may provide useful elements on the
   above-ground features such as vegetation coverage and agronomic
   procedures, allowing to assess the cost of anthropogenic land use to
   hidden diversity in soil. Datasets provided in this study may contribute
   to future searches for fungal bio-indicators as biodiversity markers of
   a specific site or a land-use degree.}},

Title = {{Relationship between Reproductive Allocation and Relative Abundance
   among 32 Species of a Tibetan Alpine Meadow: Effects of Fertilization
   and Grazing}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Understanding the relationship between species traits and
   species abundance is an important goal in ecology and biodiversity
   science. Although theoretical studies predict that traits related to
   performance (e.g. reproductive allocation) are most directly linked to
   species abundance within a community, empirical investigations have
   rarely been done. It also remains unclear how environmental factors such
   as grazing or fertilizer application affect the predicted relationship.
   Methodology: We conducted a 3-year field experiment in a Tibetan alpine
   meadow to assess the relationship between plant reproductive allocation
   (RA) and species relative abundance (SRA) on control, grazed and
   fertilized plots. Overall, the studied plant community contained 32
   common species.
   Principal Findings: At the treatment level, (i) RA was negatively
   correlated with SRA on control plots and during the first year on
   fertilized plots. (ii) No negative RA-SRA correlations were observed on
   grazed plots and during the second and third year on fertilized plots.
   (iii) Seed size was positively correlated with SRA on control plots. At
   the plot level, the correlation between SRA and RA were not affected by
   treatment, year or species composition.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our study shows that the performance-related
   trait RA can negatively affect SRA within communities, which is possibly
   due to the tradeoffs between clonal growth (for space occupancy) and
   sexual reproduction. We propose that if different species occupy
   different positions along these tradeoffs it will contribute to
   biodiversity maintenance in local communities or even at lager scale.}},

   Dynamic Modelling Approach}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Effects of agri-environment schemes (AES) on biodiversity remain
   controversial. While most AES are action-oriented, result-oriented and
   habitat-oriented schemes have recently been proposed as a solution to
   improve AES efficiency. The objective of this study was to compare
   action-oriented, habitat-oriented and result-oriented schemes in terms
   of ecological and productive performance as well as in terms of
   management flexibility. We developed a dynamic modelling approach based
   on the viable control framework to carry out a long term assessment of
   the three schemes in a grassland agroecosystem. The model explicitly
   links grazed grassland dynamics to bird population dynamics. It is
   applied to lapwing conservation in wet grasslands in France. We ran the
   model to assess the three AES scenarios. The model revealed the grazing
   strategies respecting ecological and productive constraints specific to
   each scheme. Grazing strategies were assessed by both their ecological
   and productive performance. The viable control approach made it possible
   to obtain the whole set of viable grazing strategies and therefore to
   quantify the management flexibility of the grassland agroecosystem. Our
   results showed that habitat and result-oriented scenarios led to much
   higher ecological performance than the action-oriented one. Differences
   in both ecological and productive performance between the habitat and
   result-oriented scenarios were limited. Flexibility of the grassland
   agroecosystem in the result-oriented scenario was much higher than in
   that of habitat-oriented scenario. Our model confirms the higher
   flexibility as well as the better ecological and productive performance
   of result-oriented schemes. A larger use of result-oriented schemes in
   conservation may also allow farmers to adapt their management to local
   conditions and to climatic variations.}},

Title = {{Geographical and ecological differentiation in Italian mesophilous

Journal = {{PHYTOCOENOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{4}},

Month = {{APR 4}},
Abstract = {{The alliance Cynosurion cristati has been found by various authors
   across the European continent. However, the fact that its diagnosis is
   based on species that are found in a wide range of geographical and
   ecological conditions and on the absence of grazing-sensitive species
   has rendered the characterization of this alliance somewhat complicated.
   The aims of this paper were: i) to investigate differences in the
   composition of some European mesophilous pastures, with particular focus
   on Italy; ii) to assess the main factors underlying these changes; iii)
   to evaluate the need for a new classification for such communities in
   the Italian peninsula. We used previously published data from several
   other European countries and both published and unpublished data from
   Italy. A synoptic table of data from different parts of Europe was
   analysed by means of hierarchical clustering. We used Multi-Response
   Permutational Procedure and phi coefficient to test differences between
   Cynosurion clusters and identify their diagnostic species. We performed
   Non-metric Multi-Dimensional Scaling on a table of 111 Italian releves.
   Kendall's correlation coefficient was calculated by relating the releve
   scores in the ordination with the geographical, environmental variables,
   and with the Ellenberg indices relative to soil conditions. The first
   axis scores were also used as the dependent variable in a regression
   tree. Important compositional differences were found within the
   Cynosurion cluster, with significant differences emerging between the
   Apennine pastures in central and southern Italy and those in northern
   and central Italy. The first axis ordination was strongly related to the
   latitudinal/thermal gradient. Indeed, latitude and temperature were the
   most important variables in the regression tree. Our results highlight
   marked compositional variation in Cynosurion grasslands. This variation,
   which is related in the Italian peninsula to bioclimatic and
   biogeographical factors, led us to propose a rearrangement of the
   existing classification of the alliance for this part of Europe.}},

   sustainable management or environmental destruction?}},
Journal = {{WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{111-122}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{With a total area of 160,000 km(2), the Pantanal is one of the largest
   wetlands in South America and certainly the most famous. It is essential
   for the maintenance of biodiversity and is highly ranked in national and
   international protection plans. The ecology of the Pantanal is
   influenced by the annual inundation, frequent fires during the dry
   period, and multiple human activities. To maintain traditional low
   density cattle ranching, which is the economic basis for the Pantanal's
   human population, the spread of woody vegetation into former pasture
   areas requires pasture clearing. Legal restrictions, however, have led
   to the confusion of pasture clearing with the illegal deforestation that
   has accompanied Brazil's rapid economic development, thus creating
   serious conflicts between the Pantanal's ranchers and the governmental
   environmental agency. This dichotomy of interests, i.e., the need to
   maintain habitat and species diversity while guaranteeing the
   livelihoods of the ranchers but warding off deforestation, can only be
   resolved through modern management plans that reconcile the requirements
   of environmental protection with the economic needs of the ranchers, who
   are the owners of most of the Pantanal. The key to any such plan's
   successful implementation is to consider the Pantanal not as a pristine
   wetland, but as a valuable cultural landscape. Over the last two and a
   half centuries, the vegetation in large parts of the Pantanal has been
   altered due to the presence of cattle ranches. This has maintained its
   habitat diversity and multiple services to humans and to the
   environment, including the enhancement of species diversity. This
   management practice corresponds to modern approaches in other parts of
   the world, where low density animal grazing, sometimes in combination
   with mechanical removal of woody vegetation are considered powerful
   management tools for the maintenance of valuable cultural landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Agriculture is an important source of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide
   (N2O) and the atmospherically important nitric oxide (NO). We evaluated
   the effects of different grazers and plant species composition on N2O
   and NO emissions in temperate grassland. Paddocks were grazed
   rotationally by either cattle or sheep. Mean N2O emissions were 38.7 mu
   g N2O-N m(-2) h(-1), mean NO emissions 2.4 mu g NO-N m(-2) h(-1).
   Cumulative NO-N emissions were larger for sheep-than for cattle-grazed
   paddocks. Plant species composition was insignificant compared to the
   effect of grazers on N oxide emissions. In a controlled application
   experiment, plots with cattle excreta showed larger N2O emissions than
   plots with sheep excreta, reaching peak emissions of 1921 mu g N2O-N
   m(-2) h(-1) on cattle urine patches compared to 556 mu g N2O-N m(-2)
   h(-1) on sheep urine patches, related to different N-inputs per
   excretion. Peak emissions of dung-treated plots were much smaller. The
   N2O emission factors were 0.4\% for cattle urine, 0.5\% for sheep urine,
   0.05\% for cattle dung and 0.09\% for sheep dung. N oxide emissions on
   the paddock scale were larger for sheep-compared to cattle-grazing,
   despite larger emissions per cattle excretion. We attributed this to the
   more even spread of sheep excreta compared to cattle excreta. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The lack of invertebrate prey on intensively grazed agricultural
   grassland can limit reproductive success in farmland birds. The impacts
   of lenient early season grazing followed by early cessation of grazing
   on sward structure and invertebrate communities on improved agricultural
   grassland were tested. The experiment was conducted on 13 pasture fields
   in south-west England over four successive years. Lenient early season
   grazing increased total invertebrate abundance by 71\% after 4 years,
   the most responsive groups being Araneae, Auchenorrhyncha, Collembola
   and Heteroptera. Early cessation of grazing led to increased cover of
   Holcus lanatus and Agrostis spp. and increased litter accumulation;
   clover cover and sward structural heterogeneity declined. These sward
   changes are likely to have reduced agricultural productivity and may
   have inhibited access to invertebrate prey for foraging birds. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) that do not meet the legal
   definition of wetlands are important for sustaining regional
   biodiversity, livestock grazing, and outdoor recreation in the
   Intermountain West. Such GDEs in Owens Valley, California, are also used
   to produce 11,225 hectare, meters (91,000 acre-feet) of water annually
   from about 100 water wells. We used 21 years of Landsat data and 18
   years of field monitoring data to analyze responses of 2 adjacent-meadow
   GDEs to different groundwater management practices. The northern meadow,
   which was subject to continuous water table drawdown below the rooting
   zone of phreatophytic grasses, experienced decline in total live cover
   from 42.7\% to 30.2\%, decline in grass cover from 27.5\% to 14.1\%,
   transition from grass to shrub dominance, and change from groundwater
   dependence to precipitation dependence. These responses had been
   predicted by managers in 1976. The southern meadow, which was managed
   with cycles of water table drawdown and recovery, experienced neither
   cover decline nor dominance-type conversion and remained groundwater
   dependent. Variation in depth-to-water table (DTW) explained 83\% of the
   pooled variance in total live cover in both meadows. Results showed that
   nonwetland, non-riparian GDEs are vulnerable to water table decline, as
   are wetland and riparian GDEs. Managing groundwater extraction through
   imposing one- to several-year cycles of water table drawdown and
   recovery may avoid further cover decline and type conversion in GDEs
   already affected by groundwater withdrawals.}},

Abstract = {{In northwestern Mexico, large tracts of native desert scrub and thorn
   scrub vegetation are being converted to non-native grass pastures at an
   increasing rate in an effort to increase cattle production. Pasture
   development has large impacts on vegetation structure and perennial
   plant diversity, but little is known of the potential ecological
   consequences of this landscape transformation for other taxa. I compared
   the abundance, diversity, species composition and structure of ant
   assemblages in native habitats and nonnative grass pastures across a
   longitudinal rainfall gradient in central Sonora, Mexico. Land
   conversion resulted in minor reductions of alpha and gamma diversity and
   had no effect on beta diversity or species turnover. The influence of
   land conversion on species composition was small in comparison to the
   influence of other factors. In addition, ant assemblages in native
   habitats and non-native grass pastures were similar to each other in
   regards to both species relative abundance distributions and functional
   group composition. These results suggest that ants are remarkably
   resilient to the conversion of native desert scrub and thorn scrub
   habitats to non-native grass pastures, which is consistent with the
   growing body of research reporting weak and inconsistent responses of
   ant assemblages to grazing in arid rangelands. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Invasive species challenge managers of natural areas. In many
   ecosystems, restoring and maintaining pre-historic disturbance regimes
   promotes native biodiversity and controls invasive plant species. We
   report challenges in applying patch-burn grazing to restore the
   ecological interaction between fire and herbivores in eastern North
   American tallgrass prairie. We use United States Forest Service fire
   behavior software and fuel models to simulate the effect of a
   cool-season grass invasion into tallgrass prairie. By introducing a
   high-moisture fuel type into the native fuelbed, tall fescue (Lolium
   arundinaceum Schreb. S.J. Darbyshire) creates a heterogeneous fuelbed
   that limits fire spread rate. Our results indicate that a high-moisture
   fuel type invading a high proportion of a fuelbed requires up to four
   times the wind speed to achieve a rate of spread similar to that in an
   uninvaded fuelbed. Reduced fire spread undermines restoring the natural
   fire regime, putting invaded grassland systems at a higher risk of
   succession to a woodland state. To mitigate against negative effects of
   high-moisture invaders on prescribed burning and ensure that fires
   maintain the intensity required for management goals, managers should
   consider the following when planning burns: Accumulate higher fuel loads
   by reducing herbivory or reducing fire frequency; burn earlier in the
   spring or later in the fall, during the dormant season of the invader;
   and consider alternative fire weather such as lower relative humidity,
   perhaps with lower wind speeds to maintain an acceptable level of
   complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Despite high deforestation rates in dry forests there are few
   assessments of the impacts of this transformation on biodiversity. This
   study addresses the impact of clearing on plant species composition and
   diversity in mulga (Acacia aneura) forests of Queensland, Australia
   using data collected from either side of 58 clearing boundaries,
   incorporating data on site and management conditions. The physical and
   climatic conditions of the study sites were narrowly constrained but had
   greater influence on plant composition and richness than clearing per
   se. In general, the abundance of perennial forbs and shrubs was higher
   in cleared forest compared with adjacent intact forest and there was no
   significant difference in abundance of other plant life forms. Perennial
   forb richness diminished with the age of clearings, particularly where
   acid sub-soils had been exposed and shrubs proliferated. Where
   deforestation in the mulga dry forests is not accompanied by the
   establishment of exotic pasture it has a relatively benign effect on
   plant diversity, mulga itself remains in high density as small trees and
   the integrity of the forest could be maintained with restoration.}},

Abstract = {{It has been predicted that Europe will experience a rise in temperature
   of 2.2-5.3 A degrees C within this century. This increase in temperature
   may lead to vegetation change along altitudinal gradients. To test
   whether vegetation composition has already changed in the recent decade
   due to current warming (and other concomitant environmental changes), we
   recorded plant species composition in 1995 and 2005/2006 in Swiss
   pre-alpine fen meadows (800-1,400 m a.s.l.). Despite no obvious changes
   in the management of these fens, overall, plant species richness
   (cumulative number of plant species at five plots per site)
   significantly increased over this period. This was mainly due to an
   increase in the number of thermophilous, rich-soil-indicator and
   shade-indicator species, which corresponded to increased community
   productivity and shading within the vegetation layer. In contrast, fen
   specialists significantly declined in species numbers. The strongest
   species shifts occurred at the lowest sites, which overall had a higher
   colonization rate by new species than did sites at higher altitudes.
   Vegetation change along the altitudinal gradient was also affected by
   different types of land management: early-flowering species and species
   with low habitat specificity had high colonization rates in grazed fens,
   especially at low altitudes.}},

   (26 degrees 14' E, 58 degrees 28' N).
   Methods: Plant community composition was described in 2000 and 2010 for
   restored and unmanaged stands of mesic, wet and tall sedge meadows,
   encompassing a survey of 280 vegetation plots of 1 m 9 1 m. The impact
   of restoration management (mulching for first 5 yrs, mowing in Jul with
   hay removal in consecutive years) on vegetation diversity in different
   meadow types was estimated using general linear models, changes in plant
   community composition were described by NMDS ordination, multiple
   permutation tests and Indicator species analysis.
   Results: Restoration management resulted in an increase in species
   richness on mesic meadows in one of the study sites, and caused a
   decrease in spatial species turnover and significant changes in
   community composition in all sites. The effects of restoration on
   species composition were greater in drier, more elevated mesic meadows,
   and least prominent in tall sedge meadows in floodplain depressions.
   Indicator species analysis revealed Ranunculus auricomus as a common
   indicator of management in mesic and wet meadows, and Carex cespitosa
   and Calamagrostis canescens as indicators of abandonment in wet and tall
   sedge meadows, respectively.
   Conclusions: Restoration management was successful on flooded meadows
   that had been abandoned for 15-20 yrs, where water regime and soil
   fertility have not been altered by human activities, and where the local
   species pool is still available. The current community composition under
   different management regimes made it possible to propose several species
   as management status indicators, which may further be used in practical
   decision-making when evaluating the status of meadow communities.}},

Abstract = {{Dry grasslands are one of the most species rich and endangered types of
   vegetation in Europe. In the Czech Republic, dry grasslands are mainly
   of anthropogenic origin and were formed as a result of grazing after the
   clear-cutting of thermophilous oak woods. Gradual changes in the farming
   landscape throughout the 20th century, particularly in the 1960s,
   resulted in the abandonment of the relatively infertile habitats of dry
   grasslands. After abandonment, dry grasslands decline and degrade due to
   the gradual overgrowth of woody species and expansion of perennial tall
   grasses. In the year 2000, a grazing management program was introduced
   in the protected areas within the territory of Prague City to maintain
   the species diversity of dry grasslands. The responses of the expansive
   grass species, Arrhenatherum elatius L. and multiple woody species
   (especially, Prunus spinosa L.) to differences in grazing periods were
   monitored for over a decade. Grazing in spring through the end of June
   had the greatest impact on the reduction of A. elatius and woody
   species. Grazing in the height of summer through autumn did not reduce
   the cover of these plants, and may support the prosperity of both A.
   elatius and the woody species due to higher levels of nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification reduces the biodiversity of European
   farmlands. Hay meadows represent an important farmland habitat,
   traditionally used to produce hay. With decreased demand for hay, the
   continuation of hay harvest is supported by Agri-environmental schemes
   across European Union. Modern hay harvest techniques differ from
   traditional manual harvest by removing the grass instantaneously over
   large land areas. To minimize adverse effects on meadow invertebrates,
   diversifying harvest operations is time and space is often recommended,
   but effects of such diversification are little studied. We compared the
   impact of uniform hay harvests with harvests executed in patchy manners,
   using four arthropod groups (butterflies, ground beetles, orthopterans
   and spiders) at productive, species-poor meadows in the Czech Republic.
   Butterflies, observed along transects, avoided uniformly cut units,
   preferring those cut as strips or blocks. In the three remaining groups,
   recorded using pitfall traps, a majority of species prevailed in traps
   located in uncut conditions. Synchronous mowing of large areas
   suppresses population sizes and diminishes the diversity of common
   arthropods. Besides of direct mortality and depletion of such resources
   as nectar or shelter, it synchronises sward regrowth, threatening also
   species requiring short-sward patches. Uniformly executed mowing
   contradicts the biodiversity conservation goal of Agri-environmental
   schemes. Diversifying the mowing operations via temporary fallows, or
   sequential mowing of land units, will improve the situation for common
   cultural meadows.}},

Abstract = {{Temperate grasslands are local biodiversity hotspots. In Europe, their
   extent was mostly reduced to isolated habitat patches, whose biota is
   subject to extinction debt. Knowledge on requirements of dry-grassland
   inhabitants is thus vital to slow down decline of grassland
   biodiversity. We studied habitat requirements of eight flightless steppe
   beetles, including some of the most endangered dry-grassland specialists
   of the continent. The beetles were sampled using 167 pitfall traps at a
   pannonian dry-grassland fragment, the Pouzdrany steppe, SE Czech
   Republic, from March to November 2006. The number of each species
   captures in each trap was related to vegetation and abiotic habitat
   characteristics; captures of all beetles were related to each other. Two
   of the studied species required relatively humid microhabitats,
   including tall-grass steppe with litter (Carabus hungaricus, Carabidae)
   and grassland of high herb cover (Meloe proscarabaeus, Meloidae). Others
   were associated with xeric habitats (e.g. Meloe scabriusculus) and their
   early-successional stages, including short-turf vegetation (Dorcadion
   fulvum, D. pedestre, Cerambycidae) and/or bare-ground patches (Blaps
   lethifera, Tenebrionidae; Meloe decorus, M. uralensis). Our findings
   point to key importance of early-successional vegetation for grassland
   biodiversity, and to the fact that locally co-occurring and closely
   related grassland specialists may exhibit contrasting habitat needs.
   Spatially and temporarily highly diversified patch management creating a
   fine scale mosaic of various seral stages from bare soil to tall-grass
   steppe is therefore the most appropriate approach for managing isolated
   grasslands. Prescribed burning and support of burrowing herbivores are
   recommended and discussed together with other measures for restoration
   of habitat diversity in dry-grassland fragments.}},

Abstract = {{Organic farming conserves natural resources, promotes biodiversity,
   guarantees animal welfare and obtains healthy products from raw
   materials through natural processes. In order to evaluate possibilities
   of increasing organic animal production, this study proposes a
   farm-scale multicriteria method for assessing the conversion of dairy
   goat systems to the organic model. In addition, a case study in the
   Northern Sierra of Seville, southern Spain, is analysed. A consensus of
   expert opinions and a field survey are used to validate a list of
   potential indicators and issues for assessing the conversion, which
   consider not only the European Community regulations for organic
   livestock farming, but also agroecological principles. As a result, the
   method includes 56 variables integrated in nine indicators: Nutritional
   management, Sustainable pasture management, Soil fertility and
   contamination, Weed and pest control, Disease prevention, Breeds and
   reproduction, Animal welfare, Food safety and Marketing and management.
   The nine indicators are finally integrated in a global index named OLPI
   (Organic Livestock Proximity Index). Application of the method to a case
   study with 24 goat farms reveals an OLPI value of 46.5\% for dairy goat
   farms located in mountain areas of southern Spain. The aspects that
   differ most from the agroecological model include soil management,
   animal nutrition and product marketing. Results of the case study
   indicate that the proposed method is easy to implement and is useful for
   quantifying the approximation of conventional farms to an organic model.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{208-218}},

Abstract = {{Questions: What is the overall restoration potential of the persistent
   soil seed bank of abandoned alvar grassland sites? To what degree does
   the share of characteristic alvar grassland species in the soil seed
   bank change during secondary succession from traditionally managed
   pasture towards stages overgrown by Corylus avellana and Juniperus
   communis?
   Location: Northern Estonia.
   Methods: The species composition of above-ground vegetation and the
   persistent soil seed bank were investigated in successional alvar
   grasslands. Particular attention was given to typical grassland species
   in the persistent soil seed bank. Soil seed bank density was also
   recorded. General linear models and non-metric multidimensional scaling
   were used to assess successional trends and the restoration potential of
   the soil seed bank.
   Results: The cessation of traditional management has led to a
   considerable decline in above-ground plant species richness. The
   composition of above-ground vegetation in different successional stages
   was considerably more variable than that of the seed bank. We detected
   large and species-rich persistent soil seed banks in all our study
   sites. About 70\% of species in the seed banks of overgrown sites could
   be classified as typical grassland species. The frequency of typical
   alvar grassland species, such as Arabis hirsuta, Arenaria serpyllifolia,
   Cerastium fontanum, Helianthemum nummularium, Poa angustifolia,
   Potentilla crantzii, Sedum acre and Veronica spicata in the seed bank of
   long-term abandoned (25 and 50 yr) sites was unexpectedly high.
   Conclusions: Abandoned semi-natural grassland sites in northern Estonia
   still contain a relatively large grassland community species pool,
   including a large and effective soil seed bank. The soil seed bank could
   thus play amore important role in the restoration management of
   abandoned dry grassland communities than could be concluded from
   previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{Changes of agricultural practices have led to decline of semi-natural
   habitats sustained by traditional animal husbandry in many European
   regions. The abandonment of semi-natural pastures leads to increase of
   vascular plant biomass and subsequent decline of weak competitors such
   as bryophytes. Re-establishing traditional animal husbandry may
   potentially restore biodiversity but the success of such measures
   remains insufficiently known. In this study, we asked if re-establishing
   cattle grazing on previously abandoned grasslands will restore their
   bryophyte communities. The effect of cattle grazing on bryophyte
   communities of mesic semi-natural grasslands was studied in
   south-western Finland in a comparison of (i) continuously grazed
   pastures, (ii) previously abandoned pastures where grazing was
   re-established during 1990s, and (iii) abandoned pastures, where grazing
   had ceased during late 1960s to early 1980s. The average cover, species
   richness, species density and species diversity of bryophytes were
   significantly higher in the continuously grazed than in the abandoned
   grasslands. Ordination analyses revealed clear differences also in
   community structure between the management classes. Re-established
   grasslands were ecologically heterogeneous and situated in between the
   continuously grazed and abandoned grasslands in all characteristics,
   indicating variable effect of the restoration measure. Seventeen
   bryophyte species were recognized as significant indicators of the three
   grassland classes, four of which could be used as indicators of valuable
   grassland habitats. Although there was variation in the consequences of
   re-introduction of grazing, the results give evidence of positive effect
   of grazing on regaining bryophyte diversity of abandoned grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Biological soil crusts are ecosystem engineers in arid and semi-arid
   habitats; they affect soil chemistry, stability, and vegetation. Little
   is known about regional variation in biotic crust communities of North
   America. We explored how biotic crust lichen community composition and
   richness are related to vascular plant, soil and climate characteristics
   in Oregon. In 59 0.4-ha plots, we found 99 biotic crust lichen species,
   one-third of which were observed only once. Biotic crust lichen
   communities rich in cyanolichens characterized Juniperus stands whereas
   warm grasslands were home to regionally uncommon species including
   Texosporium sancti-jacobi and Rhizocarpon diploschistidina. We discerned
   biotic crust communities in sandy Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingensis
   sites from those loamy A. arbuscula sites. Hotspots of biotic crust
   lichen species richness were geographically scattered, weakly negatively
   associated with abundance of shrubs of disturbed sites, Gutierrezia and
   Chrysothamnus. The sites with lowest biotic crust lichen richness were
   heavily grazed, burned plots with Gutierrezia in the grassy north;
   unstable steep talus slopes at the center of the study area; and sandy,
   grazed sites with Chrysothamnus in the southern portion of our region.
   Overall, regional patterns in biotic crust lichen communities were
   strongly associated with vegetation, soils, and climate. Published by

Abstract = {{The majority of native prairie has been lost throughout North America.
   Much of the remaining prairie is used for livestock grazing, so
   conservation of prairie species depends on sustainable grazing
   practices. Our objective was to evaluate the benefits of twice-over
   rotational grazing, in comparison with continuous season-long grazing
   and ungrazed ``idle{''} fields, in conserving prairie songbirds.
   Northern mixed-grass prairie in southwest Manitoba, Canada is near the
   northern range limits for many endangered grassland birds, and thus is
   an important area for evaluating the contribution of twice-over grazing
   in the conservation of songbirds, including species at risk. In 2008 and
   2009, we compared the relative abundances and diversity of grassland
   birds on 22 twice-over rotation, 15 season-long, and 8 ungrazed sites,
   using multiple 100-m fixed-radius point-count plots per site. Analyses
   were conducted using generalized linear mixed models. Although one
   obligate grassland bird, Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis),
   had significantly higher relative abundances on twice-over than
   season-long sites in 2009, season-long pastures had higher species
   richness and diversity of obligate grassland birds in both years.
   Season-long grazing may actually benefit grassland bird communities by
   creating spatially heterogeneous but temporally stable areas of high and
   low livestock use within the pasture, thus increasing diversity of
   microhabitats. We found little evidence that twice-over grazing
   contributed to the conservation of grassland songbirds in subhumid
   northern mixed-grass prairies.}},

Abstract = {{Dung beetles are considered keystone species because of their role in
   decomposition, seed dispersal, and control of vertebrate parasites in
   grazed habitats. Despite the ecological importance of this group to
   pasture ecosystem functioning, still little is known about its
   relationship with grazing management activities. We evaluated the
   conservation value of protected areas for clung beetle diversity by
   comparing two different management conditions of Mediterranean savanna
   in central Spain. Four different sites with wild herbivory (red deer,
   roe deer) were sampled inside the Caballeros National Park, and four
   sites with traditional agrosilvopastoral management were sampled in a
   sheep farm near the park. The dung beetle species richness was similar
   between savanna conditions, but the total clung beetle abundance and
   biomass were considerably greater in the park grasslands than in the
   grasslands of the sheep farm. Dung beetle species composition, species
   dominance, and abundance by functional groups from both park and farm
   sites were different, despite the high similarity among the sampled
   sites in both hydric content and dung availability. Onthophagus maki
   (Illiger 1803) and O. furcatus (Fabricius 1781) were the dominant
   species in the park, while O. furcatus, Aphodius foetidus (Herbst 1783),
   and Caccobius scbreberi L. were the dominant species on the farm.
   Species richness and abundance of telecoprids were higher in the park
   than on the farm. Abundance of paracoprids was also higher in the park
   than on the farm, while no differences in species richness and abundance
   of endocoprids were observed between both conditions. These results
   suggest that management activities such as plowing and the use of
   veterinary substances affect soil structure and dung quality and could
   be important factors that alter dung beetle assemblages in terms of
   composition, abundance, and biomass on traditional farms.}},

   around 1\% to more than 10\% in less than a century. This study
   describes planting trends up to 2005 according to habitat and
   characterises the bird assemblages of the most commonly afforested
   habitat types. Most afforestation has taken place on peats, gleys
   {[}typical of wet grassland (WG) habitats] and well-drained mineral
   soils {[}typical of improved grassland (IG) habitats]. Since 1986,
   afforestation of gley sites increased dramatically, and afforestation
   rates on both peats and gleys were more than two times greater than on
   well-drained mineral soils. Bird diversity was assessed at 27 peatland,
   WG and IG sites. Bird density and species richness were positively
   related to shrub and tree cover, which was highest in WG and lowest in
   peatland sites. Indicator analysis identified several characteristic
   bird species of WG and peatland, but no characteristic species were
   identified for IG sites. The ways in which choice of afforestation
   habitat and subsequent management of plantations could affect bird
   diversity in Ireland are discussed. Afforestation is likely to benefit
   the birds most in areas of high-productivity grass and managed at high
   intensity for grazing and/or cutting, with relatively low levels of

Abstract = {{Handling the diversity of microbes found in milk is a major challenge in
   maintaining the sensory properties and safety standards of cheese. In
   dairy farming, a number of environmental factors contribute to
   developing the microbial diversity of milk (water, air, litter, animal
   faeces, milking equipment, animals, animal feed...). Gaining a better
   knowledge of these fluxes will help make the most of this environmental
   micro flora and improve its potential. Grassland harbours a wide variety
   of microbes, which include bacteria - involved in the cheese maturation
   process, yeast and lactic bacteria, all of which compose the microbial
   population observed on the teats of cows. Recent studies have tried to
   identify the contribution of microbial fluxes from pastures, of which
   very little is known. Genetic analyses will be necessary in order to
   precisely identify these fluxes.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of cattle (Bos taurus L.) grazing on upland plant
   communities in forested rangelands are poorly understood. Cattle
   interactions with plant communities were studied in intensively managed
   (precommercially thinned (PCT) and repeatedly fertilized) silvopasture
   systems in young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var.
   latifolia Engelm.) forests. We investigated the response of plant
   community abundance and diversity to cattle grazing and how these
   responses were affected by PCT and repeated fertilization. The study was
   conducted inside and outside cattle exclosures over 10 years in two
   regional replicates in south-central British Columbia, Canada. PCT and
   repeated fertilization increased both the amount and quality of forage.
   Effects of cattle grazing on plant community abundance and diversity
   were variable and significantly influenced by the nutrient status of the
   site. In fertilized stands, cattle grazing increased species richness
   and diversity, particularly for the herb layer, although these treatment
   effects often took several years to be expressed. In unfertilized
   stands, cattle grazing did not significantly reduce herb or shrub
   volumes; however, species richness and, to a lesser extent, diversity of
   the shrub layer declined. In a landscape context, management strategies
   for silvopasture should promote heterogeneity for conservation of plant
   diversity through a variety of grazing pressures, as well as forest
   enhancement treatments such as PCT and repeated fertilization.}},

Abstract = {{The intensity of management of lowland grassland fields in the United
   Kingdom, coupled with the fact that such grasslands dominate much of the
   lowland landscape, means that there are now few opportunities for many
   plants, invertebrates, birds, or mammals to survive. The Scottish
   Agricultural College (SAC) has investigated whether fencing off the
   margins of such fields next to watercourses to control diffuse pollution
   has any positive impacts on biodiversity, based on assessments of
   vegetation composition and condition and structure of assemblages of
   invertebrates of importance as foodstuffs to farmland birds. Fencing
   watercourses increased the abundance of key groups of invertebrates.
   However, the invertebrate species diversity was not increased unless the
   margins were >= 5.4 m in width. Margins established in the study area to
   prevent access by livestock to watercourses or to enhance biodiversity
   are generally <= 2.6 m wide and are therefore unlikely to provide
   conditions for additional invertebrate species to use. The dense, tall
   swards within such margins are also unlikely to provide foraging
   opportunities for farmland birds. Management (such as low-intensity
   grazing by livestock in the margins) is essential to provide the
   conditions required for these groups, but this could conflict with the
   diffuse pollution mitigation aims. A compromise is proposed whereby
   limited autumn/winter grazing by livestock could be used to open the
   vegetation structure in the margins. Grazing by livestock at that time
   may be acceptable since it is not occurring in the period of main
   diffuse pollution concern (i.e., the fecal contamination of watercourses
   and bathing waters in the spring and summer). It is also essential that
   a landscape-scale approach is taken, driven by knowledge of the full
   needs of the species concerned, when deciding where best to target
   agri-environmental actions aimed at farmland bird conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Dispersal limitation and long-term persistence are known to delay plant
   species' responses to habitat fragmentation, but it is still unclear to
   what extent landscape history may explain the distribution of dispersal
   traits in present-day plant communities. We used quantitative data on
   long-distance seed dispersal potential by wind and grazing cattle (epi-
   and endozoochory), and on persistence (adult plant longevity and seed
   bank persistence) to quantify the linkages between dispersal and
   persistence traits in grassland plant communities and current and past
   landscape configurations. The long-distance dispersal potential of
   present-day communities was positively associated with the amounts of
   grassland in the historical (1835, 1938) landscape, and with a long
   continuity of grazing management-but was not associated with the
   properties of the current landscape. The study emphasises the role of
   history as a determinant of the dispersal potential of present-day
   grassland plant communities. The importance of long-distance dispersal
   processes has declined in the increasingly fragmented modern landscape,
   and long-term persistent species are expected to play a more dominant
   role in grassland communities in the future. However, even within highly
   fragmented landscapes, long-distance dispersed species may persist
   locally-delaying the repayment of the extinction debt.}},

Abstract = {{Species composition, number of emerging seedlings, species diversity and
   functional group of the soil seed banks, and the influence of grazing on
   the similarity between the soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation,
   were studied in 2008 and 2009 in a semi-arid savanna of Ethiopia. We
   tested whether the availability of persistent seeds in the soil could
   drive the transition from a degraded system under heavy grazing to
   healthy vegetation with ample perennial grasses. A total of 77 species
   emerged from the soil seed bank samples: 21 annual grasses, 12 perennial
   grasses, 4 herbaceous legumes, 39 forbs, and 1 woody species. Perennial
   grass species dominated the lightly grazed sites, whereas the heavily
   grazed sites were dominated by annual forbs. Heavy grazing reduced the
   number of seeds that can germinate in the seed bank. Species richness in
   the seed bank was, however, not affected by grazing. With increasing
   soil depth, the seed density and its species richness declined. There
   was a higher similarity in species composition between the soil seed
   bank and aboveground vegetation at the lightly grazed sites compared
   with the heavily grazed sites. The mean similarity between the seed
   banks and aboveground vegetation was relatively low, indicating the
   effect of heavy grazing. Moreover, seeds of perennial grasses were less
   abundant in the soil seed banks under heavy grazing. We concluded that
   restoration of grass and woody species from the soil seed banks in the
   heavily grazed areas could not be successful in semi-arid savannas of
   Ethiopia.}},

Abstract = {{There is increased global interest in the environmental impacts of
   farming, including the need to prevent the contamination of soil, water
   and air with excessive amounts of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in
   grazed systems. Reduction in grazing intensity has frequently been
   recommended to meet biodiversity and production goals in sustainable
   grazing systems. The objective of this experiment was to measure N and P
   ingestion and excretion by beef cattle grazing semi-natural pastures at
   two grazing intensities (Moderate or Lenient). The cattle grazing at
   Moderate grazing intensity had significantly more defaecations each day
   than those grazing at Lenient intensity (9.5 vs. 7.5) and tended to have
   more urinations (7.0 vs. 5.8). For the Moderate and Lenient treatments,
   respectively, 113 vs. 76 g N d(-1) was excreted compared with 136 vs. 94
   g N d(-1) ingested; 12 vs. 8 g P d(-1) was excreted compared with 13 vs.
   10 g P d(-1) ingested and urine N comprised 0.51 and 0.52 of the total N
   excreted each day. In improved, intensively managed grassland systems,
   urine N comprises a much higher proportion (approximately 0.700.85) of
   the daily total N excreted. The lower level found here is likely to
   impact on potential volatilization, denitrification and leaching losses,
   and these aspects should be examined further to see the extent to which
   semi-improved grasslands containing increased plant diversity compared
   with improved grasslands can deliver higher resource protection, as well
   as enhanced grassland faunal diversity and abundance.}},

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Grassland butterflies are on the decline throughout Europe. We tested an
   alternative rotational stocking (ARS) strategy based on theoretical and
   practical aspects of grassland ecology, designed to increase butterfly
   diversity while also meeting farmers production objectives. This
   management strategy implies taking animals away from one subplot of the
   rotation during the main flowering period. Its feasibility and benefits
   on butterfly diversity were tested by comparing ARS with continuous
   stocking (CS) in plots grazed by cattle at the same stocking rate: high
   in 2005 and 2006 then lenient in 2007 and 2008. At the high stocking
   rate, butterfly abundance (21.9 vs. 8.3, P < 0.01) and butterfly species
   richness (7.4 vs. 3.7, P < 0.001) were significantly higher in ARS than
   in CS plots, matching the increase in pasture flowering intensity and
   sward structural diversity. ARS was led according to the pre-planned
   schedule in 2005, but in 2006, the number of heifer grazing days in ARS
   was reduced by 19\% because of unfavourable spring grass growth. At the
   lenient stocking rate, ARS was less beneficial for butterflies
   (abundance: 17.4 vs. 13.0, P < 0.10; species richness: 5.9 vs. 5.2, P =
   0.35) but would present less risk for farmers in terms of providing
   livestock with sufficient forage. Alternative rotational stocking thus
   has potential to be integrated into grassland-based systems, but would
   require earlier grazing on the excluded subplot of the rotation in the
   event of unfavourable grass growth during spring.}},

Abstract = {{Semi-arid steppes in northern China have severely deteriorated over the
   past 50 years, mostly due to improper grazing management. A defoliation
   experiment was conducted on a Leymus chinensis-dominated semi-arid
   steppe to provide guidelines of grazing management and favor long-term
   restoration of degraded grasslands. There were five defoliation
   treatments: non-defoliation (no cutting during growing season) as
   control; light defoliation (cut 15 cm above ground level); medium
   defoliation (10 cm); hard defoliation (5 cm) and severe defoliation (2
   cm). Results showed that hard and severe defoliation significantly
   reduced the concentrations of soluble carbohydrates in rhizomes and
   fibrous roots and decreased the belowground biomass and the ratio of
   below/aboveground biomass. Defoliation increased plant species
   diversity, but decreased biomass of L chinensis significantly. The
   biomass of L. chinensis under light defoliation was lower than that in
   control, indicating L chinensis was highly sensitive to defoliation.
   Defoliation intensity in general had no significant effect on soil
   chemical properties during the experimental period, suggesting that soil
   chemical properties might have a greater tolerance to short-term heavy
   defoliation compared to plant community. However, prolonged intensive
   defoliation would result in severe ecological consequences. Further
   studies are required to investigate the response of soil chemical
   properties to long-term defoliation. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Water availability and plant community composition alter plant nutrient
   availability and the accumulation of plant defence compounds therefore
   having an impact on herbivore performance. Combined effects of drought
   stress and plant community composition on leaf chemicals and herbivore
   performance are largely unexplored. The objective of our study was,
   therefore, to find out the impact of extreme drought and of plant
   community composition on plant-herbivore interactions. Larvae of the
   generalist butterfly Spodoptera littoralis were reared on leaves of the
   grass Holcus lanatus which was grown in experimental communities,
   differing in species- and functional group richness. These communities
   were either subjected to extreme drought or remained under ambient
   climatic conditions. Drought decreased relative water content, soluble
   protein content, nitrogen and total phenol content and increased the
   content of carbohydrates in the grass. As a consequence, the larvae
   feeding on drought-exposed plants revealed a longer larval stage,
   increased pupal weight and higher adult eclosion rates. Plant community
   composition mainly caused changes to the defensive compounds of the
   grass, but also marginally affected protein and carbohydrate content.
   Larvae feeding on species-richest communities without legumes showed the
   highest mortality. Our findings imply that climate change that is
   projected to increase the frequency of severe droughts, as well as alter
   plant community compositions, is likely to affect arthropod-plant
   interactions through an alteration of leaf chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{Important steps in developing reliable bioindicators for soil quality
   are characterising soil biodiversity and determining the response of its
   components to environmental factors across a range of land uses and soil
   types. Baseline data from a national survey in Ireland were used to
   explore relationships between diversity and composition of
   micro-organisms (bacteria, fungi, mycorrhiza), and micro-, meso- and
   macro-fauna (nematodes; mites; earthworms, ants) across a general
   gradient representing dominant land uses (arable, pasture,
   rough-grazing, forest and bogland). These diversity data were also
   linked to soil physico-chemical properties. Differences in diversity and
   composition of meso- and macro-fauna, but not microbes, were clear
   between agriculturally-managed (arable and pasture) and
   extensively-managed (rough-grazing and bogland) soils corresponding to a
   broad division between `mineral' and `organic' soils. The abundance,
   richness and composition of nematode and earthworm taxa were
   significantly congruent with a number of the other groups. Further
   analysis, using significant indicator species from each group,
   identified potential target taxa and linked them to soil environmental
   gradients. This study suggests that there is potential surrogacy between
   the diversity of key soil taxa groups and that different sets of
   bioindicators may be most effective under agricultural and extensive
   land use. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of wildlife in managed landscapes can be facilitated by
   partnering with livestock producers to introduce grazing disturbances.
   The effects of grazing in grassland systems, however, are often a
   function of other disturbances that may occur simultaneously. The goal
   of this study was to determine how grazing and flooding disturbances
   interacted to affect butterfly communities on wetland reserve program
   easements. We sampled butterflies from 2008-2011 in two large grassland
   habitats, one exposed to low density cow-calf grazing and one maintained
   as a control. Both grassland habitats were severely flooded in 2008.
   Repeated-measures ANOVA suggested that time since flooding and the
   interaction between flooding and grazing were important predictors of
   butterfly richness at these sites. Grazing may have delayed the
   post-flood recolonization by butterflies, but by 2011, the grazed system
   contained a slightly higher species richness of butterflies than the
   ungrazed system. The grazed and ungrazed grasslands converged in
   butterfly species composition over the course of four years. Our results
   suggest that grazing may be a useful tool for managing wetland reserve
   program easement habitats and that both flooding and grazing did not
   appear to have lasting negative impacts on butterfly communities at our
   sites.}},

Pages = {{523-533}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The management regime may have a significant impact on the productivity
   and dynamics of grasslands, but the causal relationships influencing
   grassland conservation value are still not completely understood.
   Changes of selected community characteristics, such as standing crop,
   proportion of forbs in the standing crop, litter amount, litter
   decomposition and seedling recruitment, were investigated in a 4 year
   manipulative experiment in a mountain grassland in Slovakia. The aim of
   the research was to compare changes in newly abandoned sites and sites
   where restoration measures were applied after 20 years of abandonment.
   The sites were located in areas containing two vegetation types of the
   Arrhenatherion alliance (wet Poo-Trisetetum and dry
   Anthoxantho-Agrostietum) with different moisture regimes. The expected
   increase of the standing crop after abandonment was rather slow, and
   more pronounced towards the end of the experiment, and in the wet meadow
   type (similar to 30\% increase). The restoration mowing promoted forb
   proportions in the biomass, but it did not decrease the standing biomass
   in the restored grasslands. Strong litter accumulation after abandonment
   was observed in subsequent years after abandonment, when the amount of
   litter increased about 100\% in abandoned plots. Decrease in litter was
   also significant after the start of restoration mowing (a decrease from
   258 to 159 g m(-2) in wet type and from 287 to 147 g m(-2) in dry type
   was noted). Accumulated litter was negatively correlated to seedling
   recruitment (r = -0.63 at the end of the experiment). The litterbag
   experiment showed that the wet type has a higher rate of decomposition,
   with 20\% more biomass decomposed during the litter-bag experiment. The
   experiment confirmed a negative role of litter accumulation on seedling
   recruitment, with the number of seedlings per m(2) decreasing from 413
   to 321 individuals in the abandoned wet-type site. This may lead to a
   decrease in species richness. Mowing along with raking of mowed biomass
   may be a useful tool to restore degraded mountain grasslands and to
   remove accumulated litter from the stands.}},

Abstract = {{Within-population genetic diversity influences many ecological
   processes, but few studies have examined how environmental conditions
   may impact these short-term diversity effects. Over four growing
   seasons, we followed experimental populations of a clonal, ubiquitous
   weed, Taraxacum officinale, with different numbers of genotypes in
   relatively favorable fallow field and unfavorable mowed lawn
   environmental treatments. Population performance (measured as total leaf
   area, seed production or biomass) clearly and consistently increased
   with diversity, and this effect became stronger over the course of the
   experiment. Diversity effects were stronger, and with different
   underlying mechanisms, in the fallow field versus the mowed lawn. Large
   genotypes dominated in the fallow field driving overyielding (via
   positive selection effects), whereas in the mowed lawn, where
   performance was limited by regular disturbance, there was evidence for
   complementarity among genotypes (with one compact genotype in particular
   performing better in mixture than monoculture). Hence, we predict
   stronger genotypic diversity effects in environments where intense
   intraspecific competition enhances genotypic differences. Our four-year
   field experiment plus seedling establishment trials indicate that
   genotypic diversity effects have far-reaching and context-dependent
   consequences across generations.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional grasslands are often of high conservation value, but depend
   on non-intensive management like mowing for their preservation. During
   the 20th century, traditional agricultural usage was either heavily
   intensified or abandoned due to socio-economic reasons. In Eastern
   Europe, land abandonment mainly took place in regions with qualitatively
   bad soils. This large scale land use change lead to secondary
   succession. In fens and fen meadows, this may lead to a decrease in
   species richness and a replacement of specialist species by more
   generalist ones. The main objective of the present study is to examine
   if and how mowing cessation interacts with hydrology in determining
   species and trait distribution in a fen meadow. In the Upper Course of
   the Biebrza National Park, Poland, we selected 15 sites along four
   transects, with plots in mown and abandoned parcels. In these plots we
   measured plant abundance, aboveground biomass and relative light
   intensity, while plant traits were selected from different trait
   databases. The relationship between these plot characteristics and the
   different traits was assessed using concordance analysis. Mowing
   cessation resulted in reduced moss cover and light availability, while
   vegetation height increased and higher litter deposition and tussock
   development were observed. This altered environment not only resulted in
   decreased species richness and evenness in abandoned plots but also
   caused shifts in plant trait distribution. Most of the significantly
   linked traits responded more strongly to mowing cessation than to the
   hydrologic gradient. Traits related to light competition, such as light
   requirements, plant height and shoot growth form, especially responded
   to mowing cessation. This stresses the importance of light competition
   as a major factor determining species and trait distribution in fen
   systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the effects of long-term sheep grazing in salt
   marshes on the diversity of moths and derives conclusive management
   suggestions for the conservation of invertebrate diversity in salt
   marshes. Study sites were located on the Hamburger Hallig, on the
   Western coast of Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. Between 2006 and 2009,
   salt marshes that have been under four levels of livestock density (0,
   1-2 sheep/ha, 3-4 sheep/ha, 10 sheep/ha) for over 20 years were sampled
   using light traps and photoeclectors. Plant and moth species richness
   were highest under low stocking densities, moth species richness,
   however, showed no difference between low stocking densities and
   abandonment. Species richness of moths was only weakly correlated with
   vegetation parameters (species richness, vegetation height, cover and
   litter). Using additive diversity partitioning we show that no single
   grazing treatment harbored all recorded moth species and that grazing
   increases habitat heterogeneity within each treatment. Additionally, we
   show that moths react more sensitively to grazing than plants, and that
   therefore assessments of plant species richness in salt marshes do not
   allow conclusions on invertebrate diversity. For the evaluation of
   salt-marsh diversity, a multi-species approach should be favored
   combining plant and invertebrate assessments. A mosaic of abandoned
   sites and sites with low and intermediate stocking densities would
   benefit moth diversity in salt-marsh conservation. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Calcareous grasslands are among the most diverse habitats, supporting
   species-rich vegetation. Propagule limitation and availability of
   microsites for germination represent major constraints to the successful
   restoration of these grasslands. To date, little information is
   available on the effectiveness of seed addition and soil disturbance on
   the restoration success of encroached semi-natural calcareous
   grasslands. Here, we conducted a 1 year before - 9 year after
   control-impact (BACI) study aimed at testing the effect of the addition
   of seeds of native species and livestock grazing on calcareous
   grasslands. Each restoration measure and their combination differed in
   their impact on these communities and varied over time. Grazing had a
   significant, beneficial, impact on these communities, although the
   impact was species-specific. On average, grazed plots were characterized
   by a higher number of species and a lower vegetation cover. Nine years
   after treatment application, grazed site were dominated by Trifolium
   incarnatum subsp. molinerii, Xeranthemum cylindraceum, Orlaya
   grandiflora, Teucrium chamaechys and Bromus erectus while ungrazed sites
   were dominated by B. erectus, X. cylindraceum, O. grandiflora and Prunus
   spinosa. Only 8 out of 34 species responded significantly to disturbance
   or/and disturbance and seed addition while 22 species were significantly
   affected by the sampling year and 18 by a blocking factor. The low
   recruitment from added seeds and the fact that seed addition is a
   time-and labor-consuming activity suggests that an adequate level of
   disturbance and natural regeneration represent the most cost-effective
   approach to the restoration of these calcareous grasslands. (C) 2011

   Mongolia's Gobi}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{We assessed a donor-funded grassland management project designed to
   create both conservation and livelihood benefits in the rangelands of
   Mongolia's Gobi desert. The project ran from 1995 to 2006, and we used
   remote sensing Normalized Differential Vegetation Index data from 1982
   to 2009 to compare project grazing sites to matched control sites before
   and after the project's implementation. We found that the productivity
   of project grazing sites was on average within 1\% of control sites for
   the 20 years before the project but generated 11\% more biomass on
   average than the control areas from 2000 to 2009. To better understand
   the benefits of the improved grasslands to local people, we conducted
   280 household interviews, 8 focus group discussions, and 31 key
   informant interviews across 6 districts. We found a 12\% greater median
   annual income as well as a range of other socioeconomic benefits for
   project households compared to control households in the same areas.
   Overall, the project generated measurable benefits to both nature and
   people. The key factors underlying project achievements that may be
   replicable by other conservation projects include the community-driven
   approach of the project, knowledge exchanges within and between
   communities inside and outside the country, a project-supported local
   community organizer in each district, and strong community leadership.}},

Volume = {{106}},

Abstract = {{Globally, and under uncertain climate conditions, the agricultural
   sector will need to feed more people without degrading the ecosystem
   services on which production depends. Eastern Australia, coming out of a
   decade of drought, is at the leading edge of this challenge. Measures to
   adapt agriculture to increasing climate variability are urgently sought.
   One particularly promising measure is an adaptive grazing
   decision-making practice called holistic management (HM), typically
   involving high-intensity, short-duration rotational grazing and the
   encouragement of pastures with low chemical input needs. Here, we use
   photo-elicitation to compare the landscape perceptions of HM graziers
   with those of more conventional graziers, based on their choice of photo
   targets and the stories those photographs elicited. During that process,
   HM graziers described their use of adaptive farm management techniques
   to gain outcomes for production and ecosystems alike, demonstrating a
   system-based understanding of their farms conducive to farming under
   increased climate variability. We conclude that HM grazing should be
   encouraged so as to adapt the industry to climate change. More
   widespread uptake of HM practices - for public benefit as well as
   personal - depends on incentives to reduce start-up costs and expand the
   instruction of HM principles, first targeting those with high adaptive
   capacity, and removing policies that delay adaptation. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Seedling browsing by livestock has been indicated as major threat for
   forest sustainability use. Nothofagus pumilio forests are part of the
   livestock raising system in Patagonia, but because of the sparse
   understory cover, livestock graze mainly on flood meadows within the
   forest matrix. The complexity of the environment under study (forests
   and flood meadows) means that an adaptive predictor is needed to
   evaluate the intensity of resource use by livestock in order to assess
   its effect on the forest. Distance to flood meadows was evaluated as a
   predictor of the use intensity of the forest by livestock and its effect
   on the understory. The study was conducted at three sites in Chubut
   Province, Patagonia-Argentina. We established transects in the forest
   320 m long, starting at the edge flood meadow-forest. In these
   transects, the livestock presence indicators (soil compaction, density
   of feces and trails) and composition of the understory were evaluated.
   Generalized Linear Model for repeated measures for longitudinal data
   were used. The indicators showed that distance is efficient for
   estimating forest use intensity by livestock. The understory varied with
   distance, the cover of exotic herbaceous was higher near the flood
   meadow. Far from the flood meadow, the cover was entirely composited of
   native species. The results support the use of distance to flood meadows
   as a tool for decision making in livestock and forest management in N.
   pumilio forests, and for further research on livestock effect on the
   forest.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial variation in abundance has been attributed to habitat
   heterogeneity and patchiness. Our goal in this research was to
   understand what factors were associated with spatial patterns of habitat
   use by Elliot's short-tailed shrews (Blarina hylophaga Elliot, 1899) in
   tallgrass prairie. Our modeling efforts were based on 20 years
   (1981-2000) of presence-absence data for shrews at each of 20 stations
   (local site) along 14 permanent traplines on Konza Prairie Biological
   Station, Kansas, USA. A logistic model accurately predicted the presence
   of short-tailed shrews at a local site. Probability of shrew occurrence
   decreased as amount of precipitation decreased, slope steepness
   increased, grazing increased, or burned area within 500 m of a local
   site increased. However, when amount of precipitation was low, area
   burned was high, or grazing occurred, shrews were uncommon and responded
   little to the other variables. Numbers of shrews were negatively related
   only to numbers of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus (Wagner, 1845)), a
   mouse that selects burned and grazed habitats that shrews avoid. Our
   observations suggest that multiple environmental factors limit use of
   local sites, whereas competition with other species does not. Our
   results can inform decisions related to conservation of biodiversity
   given management practices in this endangered ecosystem.}},

Abstract = {{Due to serious degradation of typical Stipa bungeana steppe community on
   the Loess Plateau, a 26-year (19822007) experiment has been carried out
   by methods of forbidden grazing, cutting, and rotational grazing. Our
   results show that the process of succession of long-term enclosed S.
   bungeana community can be divided into two stages: 19801996, the forward
   succession stage, when the species diversity and biomass reach the peak
   (33.7?species/m2 and 1349.41?g/m2, respectively); 19972007, the slow
   succession stage, when the gradually thickening of litter layer (litter
   depth reaches 35?cm) directly causes the reduction of species diversity
   and biomass to 19.1?species/m2 and 863.19?g/m2, respectively. While
   under the cutting and rotational grazing methods, grassland succession
   can be divided into four stages: 1st5th year, the continuing growth
   stage; 6th9th year, the vigorous competing stage; 10th15th year, the
   aggregation growth stage of constructive species with biomass reaching
   the peak (1444.19?g/m2); and 16th23rd year, stable growth stage of
   constructive species, which form sub-climax and are eventually dominated
   by S. bungeana, with the species diversity and biomass of
   2527?species/m2 and 956.761165.35?g/m2, respectively. The constructive
   species suddenly change in the 24th year, and the population of S.
   grandis increases rapidly to 21?m-2 accounting for 25\% of the total
   plant population. Long-term enclosure leads to decreased species
   diversity and biomass and is not beneficial for grassland renewing. The
   species diversity and biomass of degraded grassland continuously
   decrease to 10?species/m2 and 392.1?g/m2 due to long-term artificial
   failure and transitionally grazing, leading to harden soil with slow

Title = {{Restoration of the fire-grazing interaction in Artemisia filifolia
   shrubland}},

Abstract = {{1. Patterns of landscape heterogeneity are crucial to the maintenance of
   biodiversity in shrublands and grasslands, yet management practices in
   these ecosystems typically seek to homogenize landscapes. Furthermore,
   there is limited understanding of how the interaction of ecological
   processes, such as fire and grazing, affects patterns of heterogeneity
   at different spatial scales.
   2. We conducted research in Artemisia filifolia (Asteraceae) shrublands
   located in the southern Great Plains of North America to determine the
   effect of restoring the fire-grazing interaction on vegetation
   structure. Data were collected for 3 years in replicated pastures grazed
   by cattle Bos taurus where the fire-grazing interaction had been
   restored (fire and grazing = treatment pastures) and in pastures that
   were grazed but remained unburned (grazing only, no fire = control
   pastures). The effect of the fire-grazing interaction on heterogeneity
   (variance) of vegetation structure was assessed at scales from 12 5 m 2
   to 609 ha.
   3. Most measurements of vegetation structure within treatment pastures
   differed from control pastures for 1-3 years after being burned but were
   thereafter similar to the values found in unburned control pastures.
   4. Treatment pastures were characterized by a lower amount of total
   heterogeneity and a lower amount of heterogeneity through time.
   5. Heterogeneity of vegetation structure tended to decrease as the scale
   of measurement increased in both treatment and control pastures. There
   was deviation from this trend, however, in the treatment pastures that
   exhibited much higher heterogeneity at the patch scale (mean patch size
   = 202 ha) of measurement, the scale at which patch fires were conducted.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Vegetation structure in A. filifolia
   shrublands of our study was readily altered by the fire-grazing
   interaction but also demonstrated substantial resilience to these
   effects. The fire-grazing interaction also changed the total amount of
   heterogeneity characterizing this system, the scale at which
   heterogeneity in this system was expressed and the amount of
   heterogeneity expressed through time. Land managers seeking to impose a
   shifting mosaic of heterogeneity on this vegetation type can do so by
   restoring the fire-grazing interaction with potential conservation
   benefits similar to what has been achieved in other ecosystems where
   historic cycles of disturbance and rest have been restored.}},

Abstract = {{Plant invasions have important ecological impacts on biodiversity, the
   functioning of ecosystems and economic sustainability. In this study, we
   evaluated the effects of four control measures (pasture sown +
   fertiliser, fertiliser and selective/non-selective herbicide
   applications) in two different grazing conditions (grazed and ungrazed)
   during a recent invasion of the exotic herb Hieracium pilosella in
   northern grasslands of Tierra del Fuego Island in Southern Patagonia,
   Argentina. As response variables, we measured the cover of the invasive
   species, the dominant growth forms of other plant species, litter and
   bare soil at patch scales (m(2)) during two consecutive growing seasons.
   The effects of fertilisation depended on the grazing conditions; H.
   pilosella cover decreased by more than 92\% and was replaced by
   dicotyledonous herbs in the ungrazed/fertilised subplots, while it
   exhibited no decrease in the grazed/fertilised subplots after the second
   growing season. Both herbicides (selective and non-selective) reduced H.
   pilosella cover by c. 63\% compared with the untreated subplots
   independently of grazing. However, the non-selective herbicide
   application resulted in an increase in bare soil and litter cover in the
   treated grazed and ungrazed subplots respectively. In contrast, such
   effects were not observed with the selective broad-leaved herbicide
   application. A control strategy based on the local application of
   selective herbicides and/or NP fertilisers, in conjunction with a
   transient ban on sheep grazing, reduced the invaders cover in the short
   term and at a local scale and also reduced the cover of bare soil
   through the restoration of native vegetation. An economic assessment of
   this strategy supported the profitability of these control measures.}},

Title = {{Harvester ants modify seed rain using nest vegetation and granivory}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{24-32}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. In annual plant communities, the seed bank determines each
   generation's potential emergence and any factor that influences it could
   alter community structure. Harvester ants are common seed predators that
   may cause seed sources and seed rain composition to vary.
   2. In semi-arid shrubland of the Negev desert of Israel, we hypothesised
   that the positive effects of dense vegetation on nests of the harvester
   ant Messor ebeninus Sant. would outweigh reduction by granivory.
   3. To test whether nests were seed sources, we removed vegetation on 10
   of 20 sampled nests prior to seeding. We tested the interaction between
   seed sources and granivory by locating seed traps at three locations:
   nests, foraging trails, and unvisited areas. Trapped seeds were recorded
   during spring and summer dispersal. Plant recruitment from the altered
   seed bank was recorded the following spring.
   4. During April, seeds were more abundant near nests than the other
   locations and at uncut compared with cut nests. Foraging trails had
   fewer species and higher equitability compared with nests or unvisited
   areas. May and June to August had highest species richness at nests, but
   richness of cut and uncut nests were similar. Ordination of plant
   recruitment showed slightly lower vegetation community variation by
   diminished species in the cut seed bank.
   5. While intact nest vegetation initially had high abundance of locally
   deposited seeds, it apparently blocked wind-dispersed seeds later in the
   summer. Conversely, granivory reduced seed species richness only on
   trails and decreased dominance structure by preferential removal of some
   species.}},

Title = {{Experimental sward islets: the effect of dung and fertilisation on
   Hemiptera and Araneae}},
Journal = {{INSECT CONSERVATION AND DIVERSITY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{46-56}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Cattle avoid grazing around their dung. This pattern persists after
   the decomposition of the initial dung patch leading to the formation of
   taller grass patches, termed islets. It is known that islets hold a
   disproportionate amount of the arthropods in grazed grasslands.
   2. An experimental manipulation was set up to investigate the relative
   effects of vegetation structure and nutrient input on arthropod
   distributions. Herbivorous bugs (Hemiptera) and predatory spiders
   (Araneae) were sampled in artificially generated islets treated with
   dung, fertiliser, a cutting regime to mimic grazing and a fallow
   control.
   3. The densities of both Hemiptera and Araneae were affected by the
   presence of increased nutrient input through dung and fertiliser. The
   densities of different herbivore taxonomic families were influenced by
   food plant quality and the predators by the subsequent increase in prey
   density.
   4. Delphacidae (Hemiptera) showed a preference for taller more nutrient
   rich swards treated with fertiliser, whereas Cicadellidae (Hemiptera)
   were more abundant in those swards treated with dung. Lycosidae
   (Araneae) were more common in dung-treated swards, whereas Linypiidae
   (Araneae) were more common in the taller fertiliser-treated swards.
   5. Higher Hemiptera species richness was found in the fertiliser-and
   dung-treated swards. It is believed that this effect was because of
   nutrient availability.
   6. It is likely that the presence of cattle dung islets in grazed
   grassland plays an important role in the maintenance of biodiversity,
   through increasing structural heterogeneity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-51}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Questions: To what extent is species richness in semi-natural grasslands
   related to local environmental factors and (present/ past) surrounding
   landscape structure? Do responses of species richness depend on degree
   of habitat specialization (specialists vs generalists) and/ or scale of
   the study? Location: O `` land, Sweden. Methods: Richness of herbaceous
   vascular plants (subdivided into richness of grassland specialists and
   generalists) was recorded within 50 9 50 cm plots and 0.1-4.8 ha
   grassland polygons. Generalized linearmodels and hierarchical
   partitioning were used to identify local factors (habitat area and
   heterogeneity, grazing intensity, habitat continuity) and landscape
   factors (proportion of surrounding grassland in 2004, 1938 and 1800, and
   landscape diversity in 2004) associated with the richness estimates.
   Results: At the polygon scale, both specialist and generalist richness
   was positively associated with local habitat area and heterogeneity and,
   independently of area and heterogeneity, with grazing intensity, habitat
   continuity and amount of surrounding grassland in 1800. At the plot
   scale, specialist species richness was positively associated with
   habitat heterogeneity, amount of surrounding grassland in 2004 and
   landscape diversity. Plot-scale generalist richness was negatively
   associated with surrounding grassland in 1938 and positively associated
   with local grazing intensity. Conclusions: Because both habitat
   specialization and study scale influence conclusions about relationships
   between species richness and local and landscape factors, the study
   highlights the need to consider species diversity at multiple spatial
   scales when making decisions about grassland management. Large-scale
   (polygon) species richness is influenced by immigration processes, with
   both specialists and generalists accumulating in old grasslands over
   centuries of grazing management. Habitat heterogeneity increased
   specialist species richness at both scales, suggesting that management
   policies should favour maintenance of a heterogeneous mosaic of open
   areas, trees and shrubs in temperate grazed grasslands. Although
   grassland specialists are sensitive to grassland isolation, in
   extensively managed landscapes with high landscape diversity input of
   grassland species from the landscape matrix may buffer negative effects

Abstract = {{Questions: How does heavy grazing change plant community structure,
   composition and species richness and diversity in an ecotone between
   grassland and semi-arid shrub steppe-type vegetation? Does grazing
   favour plants with arid affinity over those with less arid affinity?
   Does the grazing-induced transformation constitute a switch to the
   equivalent of a shrub-dominated biome?
   Location: Central South Africa.
   Methods: Using systematic scanning of SPOT 5 imagery and
   ground-truthing, a grazing treatment area was selected that met criteria
   of intensity of grazing, sampling requirements, and biogeographical
   position within a broad ecotonal zone. Differential vegetation responses
   to heavy grazing were tested for significant differences in plant
   traits, vegetation structure, and species diversity, richness and
   evenness. Gamma diversity was calculated for the whole study site,
   whereas, independent beta diversity was calculated across the treatments
   assuming the additive partitioning of diversity. In addition, the
   biogeographical association of grazing-induced species shifts was
   determined using a range of available databases.
   Results: Canopy cover and height of woody shrubs increased significantly
   with heavy grazing whereas that of graminoid plants declined. The
   resultant species turnover was modest, apparent extinctions of local
   species were minimal, species richness was maintained and species
   diversity was significantly enhanced. There was a significant increase
   in species evenness, through possible suppression of dominant species.
   Significant increases in species cover were those associated with mainly
   the Nama-Karoo biome indicating that species from more arid areas are
   more resistant to grazing as would be expected by the convergence model
   of aridity and grazing resistance.
   Conclusions: The significant increase in shrub cover in heavily grazed
   semi-arid grassland followed general global expectations. The study
   confirmed that the supposed former large shift of grassland to shrubby
   Nama-Karoo in the eastern upper Karoo can indeed be readily affected by
   heavy grazing. The negative connotations for biodiversity that have
   often been associated with intense grazing seem, in terms of the
   positive responses of plant species diversity in this study, to perhaps
   be exaggerated. The elevated species diversity with grazing of
   vegetation with a long evolutionary grazing history in a low resource
   area may require a reappraisal of the application of certain grazing
   hypotheses.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Grasslands restoration is a key management tool contributing to the
   long-term maintenance of insect populations, providing functional
   connectivity and mitigating against extinction debt across landscapes.
   As knowledge of grassland insect communities is limited, the lag between
   the initiation of restoration and the ability of these new habitats to
   contribute to such processes is unclear. Using ten data sets, ranging
   from 3 to 14 years, we investigate the lag between restoration and the
   establishment of phytophagous beetle assemblages typical of species rich
   grasslands. We used traits and ecological characteristics to determine
   factors limiting beetle colonisation, and also considered how food-web
   structure changed during restoration. For sites where seed addition of
   host-plants occurred the success in replicating beetle assemblages
   increased over time following a negative exponential function.
   Extrapolation beyond the existing data set tentatively suggested that
   success would plateau after 20 years, representing a c. 60\% increase in
   assemblage similarity to target grasslands. In the absence of seed
   addition, similarity to the target grasslands showed no increase over
   time. Where seed addition was used the connectance of plant-herbivore
   food webs decreased over time, approaching values typical of species
   rich grasslands after c. 7 years. This trend was, however, dependent on
   the inclusion of a single site containing data in excess of 6 years of
   restoration management. Beetles not capable of flight, those showing
   high degrees of host-plant specialisation and species feeding on
   nationally rare host plants take between 1 and 3 years longer to
   colonise. Successful grassland restoration is underpinned by the
   establishment of host-plants, although individual species traits
   compound the effects of poor host-plant establishment to slow
   colonisation. The use of pro-active grassland restoration to mitigate
   against future environmental change should account for lag periods in
   excess of 10 years if the value of these habitats is to be fully
   realised. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{European Alpine landscapes are facing marked land-use changes. On the
   one hand, outdoor winter recreation is spreading, with ski
   infrastructure degrading fragile mountain habitats, and snowsports
   causing disturbance and stress to wildlife. On the other hand, the
   abandonment of traditional grazing practices on timberline grasslands is
   leading to their encroachment by shrubs and forest, which decreases
   habitat heterogeneity and negatively affects biodiversity. We used the
   black grouse, a declining key indicator species of the Alpine timberline
   ecosystem, to assess optimal breeding habitat characteristics, with the
   goal of providing guidelines for appropriate restoration. Using Mixed
   Effects Logistic Regression analyses, we compared habitat features both
   at visited and at pseudoabsence locations within individual home ranges
   in order to determine the optimal habitat for males and females.
   Horizontal and vertical structural heterogeneity within all vegetation
   layers was the best predictor of occurrence for both sexes. In contrast,
   vegetation composition affected the presence of females, but not that of
   males. Females preferred a diverse, complex mosaic consisting of
   isolated mature coniferous trees and scattered small regenerating trees,
   associated with shrub cover (Ericacea) and Alpine meadows (Nardion).
   Chick-rearing females furthermore avoided roads, forest tracks and
   walking paths. The optimal predicted proportions of habitat types
   obtained from the model provide guidelines for the restoration of
   timberline ecosystems through corrective forestry measures and/ or
   adapted grazing practices. These measures are likely to also benefit
   other Alpine timberline biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{The world's ecosystems are subjected to various anthropogenic global
   change agents, such as enrichment of atmospheric CO2 concentrations,
   nitrogen (N) deposition, and changes in precipitation regimes. Despite
   the increasing appreciation that the consequences of impending global
   change can be better understood if varying agents are studied in
   concert, there is a paucity of multi-factor long-term studies,
   particularly on belowground processes. Herein, we address this gap by
   examining the responses of soil food webs and biodiversity to enrichment
   of CO2, elevated N, and summer drought in a long-term grassland study at
   Cedar Creek, Minnesota, USA (BioCON experiment). We use structural
   equation modeling (SEM), various abiotic and biotic explanatory
   variables, and data on soil microorganisms, protozoa, nematodes, and
   soil microarthropods to identify the impacts of multiple global change
   effects on drivers belowground. We found that long-term (13-year)
   changes in CO2 and N availability resulted in modest alterations of soil
   biotic food webs and biodiversity via several mechanisms, encompassing
   soil water availability, plant productivity, and most importantly
   changes in rhizodeposition. Four years of manipulation of summer drought
   exerted surprisingly minor effects, only detrimentally affecting
   belowground herbivores and ciliate protists at elevated N. Elevated CO2
   increased microbial biomass and the density of ciliates, microarthropod
   detritivores, and gamasid mites, most likely by fueling soil food webs
   with labile C. Moreover, beneficial bottom-up effects of elevated CO2
   compensated for detrimental elevated N effects on soil microarthropod
   taxa richness. In contrast, nematode taxa richness was lowest at
   elevated CO2 and elevated N. Thus, enrichment of atmospheric CO2
   concentrations and N deposition may result in taxonomically and
   functionally altered, potentially simplified, soil communities.
   Detrimental effects of N deposition on soil biodiversity underscore
   recent reports on plant community simplification. This is of particular
   concern, as soils house a considerable fraction of global biodiversity
   and ecosystem functions.}},

Abstract = {{For the past century, woody plants have increased in grasslands and
   savannas worldwide. Woody encroachment may significantly alter ecosystem
   functioning including fire regimes, herbivore carrying capacity,
   biodiversity and carbon storage capacity. Traditionally, increases in
   woody cover and density have been ascribed to changes in the disturbance
   regime (fire and herbivores) or rainfall. Increased atmospheric CO2
   concentrations may also contribute, by increasing growth rates of trees
   relative to grasses. This hypothesis is still heavily debated because
   usually potential CO2 effects are confounded by changes in land use
   (disturbance regime). Here we analyse changes in woody density in fire
   experiments at three sites in South African savannas where the
   disturbance regime (fire and herbivores) was kept constant for 30 and 50
   years. If global drivers had significant effects on woody plants, we
   would expect significant increases in tree densities and biomass over
   time under the constant disturbance regime. Woody density remained
   constant in a semiarid savanna but tripled in a mesic savanna between
   the 1970s and 1990s. At the third site, a semiarid savanna near the
   southern limits of the biome, tree density doubled from the mid 1990s to
   2010. Interpretation of the causes is confounded by population recovery
   after clearing, but aerial photograph analysis on adjacent non-cleared
   areas showed an accompanying 48\% increase in woody cover. Increased CO2
   concentrations are consistent with increased woody density while other
   global drivers (rainfall) remained constant over the duration of the
   experiments. The absence of a response in one semiarid savanna could be
   explained by a smaller carbon sink capacity of the dominant species,
   which would therefore benefit less from increased CO2. Understanding how
   savannas and grasslands respond to increased CO2 and identifying the
   causes of woody encroachment are essential for the successful management
   of these systems.}},

Abstract = {{1. Agricultural intensification is a major cause of biodiversity loss in
   European farmlands. Grasslands are particularly important habitats for
   the conservation of rich insect assemblages of Central and Eastern
   Europe. Although regular grazing or mowing of these grasslands is
   required to maintain diversity, there is no information about how such
   management and other factors influence Hemiptera assemblages.
   2. We studied leafhopper and true bug assemblages in semi-natural
   grasslands in three regions of the Great Hungarian Plain. We
   investigated how local vegetation factors and landscape complexity
   influence assemblages and whether they interact with management effects.
   3. Seven pairs of intensively (>1 cow/ha) versus extensively (similar to
   0.5 cow/ha) grazed pastures were sampled in each region by
   sweep-netting.
   4. Sward height was the most important explanatory factor for
   leafhoppers (84 species, 27264 individuals), as it increased both
   species number and abundance, and influenced assemblage composition. The
   extent of grassland surrounding the sample sites negatively affected
   leafhoppers, whereas extensive grazing decreased abundance and
   influenced composition. True bug assemblages (140 species, 6656
   individuals) were positively affected only by mean sward height, whereas
   regional differences determined the community composition of both taxa.
   5. We conclude that vegetation structure is the primary factor shaping
   Hemiptera communities and that the various types of grasslands studied
   are all important habitats for the taxon. Therefore, cattle grazing in
   its current form is beneficial for the rich Hemiptera fauna in lowland
   pastures of Hungary. However, in some cases, local and landscape factors
   and great regional differences may confound the effects of grazing, and
   this must be considered in conservation planning in the future.}},

Title = {{Aboveground-belowground interactions as a source of complementarity

Journal = {{PLANT AND SOIL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{351}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{1-22}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
   (BEF) is due mainly to complementarity between species. Most BEF studies
   primarily focused on plant interactions; however, plants are embedded in
   a dense network of multitrophic interactions above and below the ground,
   which are likely to play a crucial role in BEF relationships.
   In the present review I point out the relevance of
   aboveground-belowground interactions as a source of complementarity
   effects in grassland biodiversity experiments. A review of the current
   knowledge on the role of decomposers, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi,
   rhizobia, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, invertebrate ecosystem
   engineers, herbivores, pathogens and predators in biodiversity
   experiments, indicates that soil biota can drive both positive and
   negative complementarity between plant species via a multitude of
   mechanisms.
   I pose four main processes by which aboveground-belowground interactions
   determine positive complementarity effects: enlarging biotope space,
   mediating legume effects, increasing plant community resistance, and
   maintaining plant diversity. By contrast, soil biota may also reinforce
   negative complementarity effects by competing with plants for nutrients
   or by exerting herbivore or pathogen pressure, thereby reducing
   community productivity. Thus, considering aboveground-belowground
   interactions as well as interactions between antagonistic and
   mutualistic consumers may improve the mechanistic understanding of
   complementarity effects in plant diversity-ecosystem functioning
   experiments and should inspire future research.}},

Abstract = {{Uneven use of grasslands and savannas by livestock has a significant
   impact on ecosystem productivity, biodiversity, and function. In studies
   of livestock distribution, global positioning systems (GPS) collars are
   frequently used and the rapid rate of technological improvement has
   brought new opportunities to collect extremely large amounts of very
   accurate spatial information. However, these advances also pose
   statistical challenges associated with the analysis of large, temporally
   correlated, datasets. Our main goal was to find the optimal sampling
   time intervals for GPS collar schedules when studying livestock
   distribution in semi-arid ecosystems. The schedule must provide maximum
   spatio-temporal information while avoiding problems of autocorrelation
   of sequential locations to provide a methodology that is both practical
   and statistically valid. We used GPS collar data collected in the
   Southwestern region of the United States. In each study cattle were
   tracked and data were recorded every 5 min. Location information from
   the 5-min GPS fixes were subsampled into 10, 20. 30, 60, 90, 120, 150,
   180, 240, 300, 360, and 420-min regular intervals. We calculated the
   Euclidean distance between pairs of successive locations then conducted
   correlation analyses to determine the degree of similarity between
   successive traveled distances. We then selected two correlated and two
   non-correlated time-interval datasets to compare estimates of kernel
   home range and minimum convex polygon areas. Successive Euclidean
   distances between GPS locations were significantly correlated when time
   intervals were <120 min. The calculated distance traveled was
   significantly reduced as time intervals between successive locations
   increased. Kernel home range values were smaller in correlated than in
   non-correlated datasets yet minimum convex polygon values were greater
   in correlated data than in non-correlated data sets. Our study shows the
   importance of considering different livestock sampling time intervals
   using GPS to achieve accurate and meaningful results on animal
   distributions especially in semi-arid ecosystems. Circumstances in which
   researchers may elect to use short-time interval autocorrelated data
   sets are also discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Associated with Differentiation of Taraxacum officinale into r- and
   K-Strategists}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Background: Differential selection between clones of apomictic species
   may result in ecological differentiation without mutation and
   recombination, thus offering a simple system to study adaptation and
   life-history evolution in plants.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We caused density-independent mortality
   by weeding to colonizer populations of the largely apomictic Taraxacum
   officinale (Asteraceae) over a 5-year period in a grassland biodiversity
   experiment (Jena Experiment). We compared the offspring of colonizer
   populations with resident populations deliberately sown into similar
   communities. Plants raised from cuttings and seeds of colonizer and
   resident populations were grown under uniform conditions. Offspring from
   colonizer populations had higher reproductive output, which was in
   general agreement with predictions of r-selection theory. Offspring from
   resident populations had higher root and leaf biomass, fewer flower
   heads and higher individual seed mass as predicted under K-selection.
   Plants grown from cuttings and seeds differed to some degree in the
   strength, but not in the direction, of their response to the r- vs.
   K-selection regime. More diverse communities appeared to exert stronger
   K-selection on resident populations in plants grown from cuttings, while
   we did not find significant effects of increasing species richness on
   plants grown from seeds.
   Conclusions/Significance: Differentiation into r- and K-strategists
   suggests that clones with characteristics of r-strategists were selected
   in regularly weeded plots through rapid colonization, while increasing
   plant diversity favoured the selection of clones with characteristics of
   K-strategists in resident populations. Our results show that different
   selection pressures may result in a rapid genetic differentiation within
   a largely apomictic species. Even under the assumption that colonizer
   and resident populations, respectively, happened to be r- vs. K-selected
   already at the start of the experiment, our results still indicate that
   the association of these strategies with the corresponding selection
   regimes was maintained during the 5-year experimental period.}},

Abstract = {{The diminution of pastoral activities in marginal areas, and

   invasive vegetation. The conservation of the open areas is however
   particularly important for wildlife management. With this aim, this
   paper describes the results obtained in a protected area on the Apennine
   mountains (Italy), encroached by Pteridium aquilinum (L.) Kuhn. Two
   restoration practices were carried out by the Administration of the
   Regional Park of the Laghi di Suviana e Brasimone (Bologna, Italy), in
   order to reverse the infestation of bracken and restore pastures within
   the park. The pasture, only grazed by wild animals, was improved through
   different treatments (ploughing followed by cuttings vs harrowing), each
   followed by seeding of a forage mixture. Our results showed better
   performance of the ploughing both as pastoral value of recovered pasture
   and as botanical composition. Some differences in the effects of the two
   restoration techniques were also found on the biodiversity index and on
   floristic richness. Data about grazing selection of the single botanical
   species have also been collected. The tesults also showed different
   behaviour in feeding preferences for wild ungulates in comparison to
   domestic stocks, giving a better evaluation of the real forage
   availability for wild herbivores.}},

Title = {{Spring and summer habitat preferences of little bustard in an
   agro-pastoral area in Sardinia (Italy)}},
Journal = {{ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{329-336}},
Abstract = {{The little bustard Tetrax tetrax (Aves, Gruiformes) is a threatened bird
   species, which is highly reliant on extensively grazed semi-natural
   grasslands. It is one of the more rapidly declining species in Europe
   due to the widespread intensification of agricultural practices and
   consequent abandonment of agro-pastoral activities. Therefore,
   understanding its habitat requirements in different seasons is crucial
   to implement adequate habitat management measures. Previous knowledge of
   habitat preference of the little bustard in Sardinia, which nowadays
   supports the only remnant isolated population present in Italy, is only
   available for the breeding season. We conducted surveys of displaying
   males in spring and of mixed flocks (of different age and sex classes)
   in summer and quantified habitat requirements in the two seasons using
   logistic regression analysis. Overall, we detected 85 displaying males
   in spring and seven mixed flocks (totalling 77 individuals) in summer
   within the study area. Interestingly, habitat preference models
   evidenced contrasting needs between the two different seasons: Males
   occurrence in spring was higher with greater fallow cover and further
   from water, whereas in summer flock occurrence was negatively related to
   fallow cover. This seasonal change in fallow preference is likely due to
   the effect of grazing livestock on this land-use. Extensive grazing is
   known to shape adequate habitat structure for displaying males in
   spring. On the other hand, grazing animals in summer may deplete the
   already limited food resources (i.e. green plants) available during this
   dry period of the year and when energy requirement for the little
   bustard is high due to feather moulting. This may explain the observed
   avoidance of fallow cover in summer. Conservation efforts in Sardinia
   should aim at maintaining a mosaic of diverse habitats that may provide
   complementary resources at any given time of the year that would benefit

Abstract = {{Calcareous grasslands in Central Europe harbour a high diversity of
   plant and animal species. However, as man-made habitats, they need to be
   managed in order to maintain high species diversity. Conservation
   efforts often aim at reintroducing historical management regimes, such
   as regular grazing or mowing. Despite such efforts, the diversity and
   number of species of calcareous grasslands is still decreasing. We
   propose that, besides fragmentation and eutrophication, a lack of
   structural heterogeneity within and around calcareous grasslands as
   created by historic management is causing species loss as well. Here, we
   review the literature on the history of calcareous grassland management
   in northern Switzerland, the heterogeneity that it created and the
   relevance of this heterogeneity for biodiversity at three spatial
   scales: (1) within grasslands, (2) in their close surroundings and (3)
   at the landscape scale. Considering that historic management has created
   heterogeneity at all three scales and that many species do indeed depend
   on this structural diversity, we conclude that in order to conserve the
   full range of biodiversity associated with calcareous grasslands,
   conservation management should aim at increasing heterogeneity in,
   around, and between grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Previous work has shown exotic and native plant species richness are
   negatively correlated at fine spatial scales and positively correlated
   at broad spatial scales. Grazing and invasive plant species can
   influence plant species richness, but the effects of these disturbances
   across spatial scales remain untested. We collected species richness
   data for both native and exotic plants from five spatial scales
   (0.5-3000 m(2)) in a nested, modified Whittaker plot design from
   severely grazed and ungrazed North American tallgrass prairie. We also
   recorded the abundance of an abundant invasive grass, tall fescue
   (Schedonorus phoenix (Scop.) Holub), at the 0.5-m(2) scale. We used
   linear mixed-effect regression to test relationships between plant
   species richness, tall fescue abundance, and grazing history at five
   spatial scales. At no scale was exotic and native species richness
   linearly related, but exotic species richness at all scales was greater
   in grazed tracts than ungrazed tracts. Native species richness declined
   with increasing tall fescue abundance at all five spatial scales, but
   exotic species richness increased with tall fescue abundance at all but
   the broadest spatial scales. Severe grazing did not reduce native
   species richness at any spatial scale. We posit that invasion of tall
   fescue in this working landscape of originally native grassland plants
   modifies species richness-spatial scale relationships observed in less
   disturbed systems. Tall fescue invasion constitutes a unique biotic
   effect on plant species richness at broad spatial scales.}},

   highest of species-area examinations however weed appeared because of
   degradation which provided more species. According to species-area
   examinations overgrazed areas were richer in species then other examined
   areas. Based on diversity data drinking area considered degraded, while
   meadow and overgrazed areas was considered as proper state. Diversity of

   Botanical analysis has confirmed the presence of plant diversity, as

Abstract = {{Background: Agricultural intensification has transformed most grasslands
   of Central Europe from non-intensive to highly intensive management
   during the last 50 years, resulting in large reductions of species
   diversity. This impoverishment has raised concern with regard to
   ecosystem functions. Positive diversity effects on productivity have
   been found in experiments with synthetic grasslands but were rarely
   confirmed in semi-natural grasslands in the field. Aims: Our objective
   was to investigate the diversityproductivity relationship independently
   from management effects in mature grassland. Methods: We conducted a
   three-factorial experiment (fertilisation, mowing frequency, diversity;
   n?=?6) in a permanent grassland to disentangle effects of management
   intensity and diversity on above-ground biomass (AGB), fine root biomass
   and root distribution patterns. Herbicides were applied to increase the
   diversity gradient across the plots. Results: While fertilisation had a
   strong positive effect on AGB and the cutting frequency a minor one, AGB
   was negatively related to species richness. Root biomass and
   distribution gave no indication of below-ground complementary resource
   use. Conclusions: The N-driven productivity increase since the 1950s is
   by far more influential on above-ground productivity than any diversity
   effect. Field manipulation studies in mature communities are needed to
   understand the productivitydiversity relationship in grasslands under
   changing land use.}},

Abstract = {{Seed mass is one of the most important plant traits. It is strongly
   related to plant fitness and life-history strategy, and is one of the
   key determinants of the ability of plants to spread and thus to respond
   to changing environments. While substantial empirical work has been
   devoted to understanding seed-mass variation across species, we know
   less about seed-mass variation within species, its geographical and
   ecological differentiation, and the degree to which it is influenced by
   environmental change. Here, we studied intraspecific variability in seed
   mass of six common grassland plants (Arrhenatherum elatius, Bromus
   hordeaceus, Cerastium holosteoides, Heracleum sphondylium, Trifolium
   repens and Veronica chamaedrys) across three regions in Germany and a
   broad range of land-use types and intensities. We found substantial
   seed-mass variation among regions, populations, and individuals within
   all of the studied species. In five species, seed mass had a strong and
   consistent geographic component, and in three species we found
   significant effects of land use fertilisation, grazing intensity or
   mowing frequency on seed mass. In several species, land use and
   geographic region not only affected mean seed mass, but also the
   variability of seed mass within populations. Our study demonstrates that
   seed mass is geographically and ecologically differentiated in common
   grassland species. It is likely that both phenotypic plasticity and
   genetic factors contribute to this differentiation. Our results also
   show that seed mass is a highly variable trait with typically around
   10-fold variation within species.}},

Abstract = {{The diversity of Coleoptera communities in tussock grassland at two

   pasture species and cultivated sown pasture. Coleoptera were
   heat-extracted from turf samples taken in summer in two consecutive
   years. In native and oversown treatments, Staphylinidae and
   Curculionidae predominated in abundance at three of the four sites, and
   in species richness at all sites and treatments. Carabidae were more
   species-rich than Curculionidae in cultivated treatments at most sites.
   The mean density of Coleoptera in native tussock treatments ranged
   between 654/m(2) and 97/m(2). Carnivores were the predominant trophic
   group followed by herbivores. Species diversity was higher in the native
   or oversown treatments and the Otago sites were the most diverse
   overall, and the least disturbed. A total of 19 exotic species were
   found but there was no relationship with treatment, although their
   density was higher in cultivated treatments. There was no evidence to
   suggest that modified vegetation provides a source of exotic Coleoptera
   species to invade native tussock.}},

Title = {{A direct benefit of native saltbush revegetation for an endemic lizard

Abstract = {{Land alteration for intensive agriculture has been a major cause of
   species decline and extinction globally. In marginal grazing regions of
   southern Australia, native perennial shrubs are increasingly being
   planted to supplement pasture feeding of stock. Such revegetation has
   the benefits of reducing erosion and salinity, and importantly, the
   potential provision of habitat for native fauna. We explored the use of
   revegetated native saltbush by the sleepy lizard (Tiliqua rugosa) an
   endemic Australian species common in the region. We repeatedly sampled
   revegetated saltbush throughout 2010 and 2011 for adults (n = 55) and
   juveniles (n = 26). Using genotypes from eight microsatellite loci,
   parents were assigned to half of all juveniles with high statistical
   confidence. Parents were sampled in the same patch of revegetated
   saltbush as their offspring, thus supporting the observation that
   juvenile sleepy lizards remain within the home range of their parents
   before dispersal. Most importantly, our findings indicate that
   revegetated saltbush provides important habitat for T. rugosa at
   significant life stages - before and during breeding for adults, and
   before dispersal for juveniles. We conclude that revegetation using
   simple, monoculture plantations provides beneficial habitat for T.
   rugosa and may also be beneficial habitat for other native species in
   human-altered agricultural landscapes.}},

Title = {{Vegetation change in response to grazing exclusion in montane
   grasslands, Argentina}},
Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{313-322}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - Natural montane grasslands in the Southern Pampas
   of Argentina are expected to show a high potential for recovery after
   heavy grazing due to their evolutionary history in the presence of large
   herbivores and their high productivity. The objective of this work is to
   compare plant diversity, bare soil percentage, biomass and botanical
   composition between grazed and non-grazed areas at different times
   following grazing exclusion.
   Methods - Vegetation was assessed on exclosures established in 2006 and
   on nearby areas open to grazing by feral horses in December 2006, 2007,
   2008 and 2009. In 2009 we added 15 year old exclosures to the analysis.
   Key results - Species richness declined 24 months after grazing
   exclusion, mainly due to a decrease in the abundance of forb species.
   Bare soil percentage was significantly reduced 12 months after
   exclosures were built. Above-ground biomass showed a 3-fold increase 12
   months after grazing exclusion. After three years, species richness and
   biomass were similar to those corresponding to older exclosures
   (15-years old). The composition of plant communities also changed
   following horse exclusion, with three and 15-years old exclosures
   dominated by perennial grasses typical of late seral stages.
   Conclusions - Our results support the hypothesis that natural montane
   grasslands in the Southern Pampas of Argentina may recover fast from
   grazing by large herbivores without application of specific restoration
   techniques.}},

Title = {{Earthworm Communities in Soils of Estonian Wooded Meadows}},
Journal = {{BALTIC FORESTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{111-118}},
Abstract = {{Wooded meadows are traditional semi-natural meadows in the region around
   the Baltic Sea. They are mowed regularly once per year, and some meadows
   are lightly grazed by sheep or cattle in late summer after mowing. Data
   on soil fauna in wooded meadows are still scarce in spite of their
   importance to ecosystem functioning. The aim of this study was to
   describe the taxonomic and ecological structure of earthworm communities
   in relation to the chemical and microbiological characteristics of the
   soil and meadow restoration conditions in Estonian wooded meadows. The
   chemical and microbiological parameters of the soil were studied so as
   to characterize the habitat of the earthworms. Earthworms were collected
   using a mustard solution as vermifuge. In total, the earthworm
   communities of wooded meadows consisted of eight species. The most
   abundant species were the endogeic Aporrectodea caliginosa and
   Aporrectodea rosea. The dominant epigeic species was Lumbricus rubellus
   in meadows with higher soil moisture and Dendrobaena octaedra in a dry
   meadow. In wooded meadows, richness of plant species and diversity in
   earthworm communities have developed in calcareous soil conditions.
   Different layers of plant cover create several different microhabitats
   for soil invertebrates including earthworms, thus promoting diversity.
   The taxonomic composition of communities depends on soil conditions;
   mostly on soil moisture. The restored wooded meadows differ
   significantly from the long-term managed meadows by the ecological
   structure of the earthworm communities: in mowed meadows the community
   consists of more endogeic and fewer epigeic species compared to the
   restored meadows.}},

   properties}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{301-311}},
Abstract = {{A combined analysis of plant trait responses to the environment, and
   their effects on ecosystem properties has recently been proposed. In
   this study, we related the trait composition of plant communities to
   soil nutrients and disturbance as environmental drivers and to
   productivity, decomposition and soil carbon as ecosystem properties. We
   surveyed two sites, one comprising intensively grazed and fertilized
   grasslands, the other consisting of semi-natural grassland and open
   heathland. Species abundance and trait values of 149 species were
   recorded in 69 plots, as well as parameters describing soil resources,
   land-use disturbances, and ecosystem properties. Our main goal was to
   test whether the average or the diversity of the trait values of the
   vegetation had stronger effects on ecosystem properties (mass ratio vs.
   diversity hypothesis). Structural equation modeling was used to perform
   a simultaneous analysis of trait responses and effects. Specific leaf
   area and leaf nutrient contents were always negatively correlated with
   stem dry matter content and canopy height, indicating greater
   investments in supportive and nutrient-conserving tissue as plants
   increased in size. In the agricultural site, disturbance was the single
   most important factor decreasing plant height, while leaf traits such as
   specific leaf area and leaf nutrient contents increased with soil
   resources in heathlands. Productivity was directly or indirectly driven
   by leaf traits, and investments in structural tissue increased standing
   biomass and soil carbon. Different environmental drivers in the two
   sites produced opposing leaf trait effects on litter decomposition.
   Ecosystem properties were explained by the community mean trait value as
   predicted by the mass ratio hypothesis. Evidence for effects of
   functional diversity on productivity and other ecosystem properties was
   not detected, suggesting that diversity productivity relationships
   depend on the length of the investigated environmental gradients. We
   conclude that changes in community composition and dominance hierarchies
   deserve the most attention when ecosystem properties must he maintained.}},

Title = {{EFFECT OF VEGETATION AND MANAGEMENT ON OCCURRENCE OF LARVAE AND ADULTS
   OF GENERALIST MANIOLA JURTINA L. (LEPIDOPTERA) IN MEADOW HABITATS}},
Journal = {{POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{601-609}},
Abstract = {{Larvae and adults of some generalist insect species co-occur in
   identical habitats whereas adults and larvae of other generalist species
   do not co-occur and occupy different habitats. The Meadow brown, Maniola
   jurtina (L.) (Lepidoptera: Nymphalidae), is common and widely
   distributed in Europe where it is considered a habitat generalist. As
   knowledge about the occurrence of the larvae of the Meadow brown is
   scarce (different and more difficult methods are needed to collect
   larvae compared to adults) a complex assessment of the life strategy of
   this generalist is limited. We addressed here the question as to whether
   the adults and larvae of the Meadow brown co-occurred in the same
   habitats and how they depended on the type of grassland vegetation and
   habitat management. We expected co-occurrence of adults and larvae and
   similar effects of habitat management on them.
   We selected four habitat types belonging to the alliance Arrhenatherion
   elatioris W. Koch 1926, which form mosaic patterns in the rural
   landscape of central Slovakia: (1) extensive meadows mown once a year,
   (2) extensive meadows mown twice a year, (3) abandoned meadows, and (4)
   ecotones between deciduous forests and meadows mown once a year. Adults
   were counted in each habitat on seven transects 50 m long (in seven
   replicates) during the summer of 2003, 2004 and 2005. Larvae were
   collected in each habitat on 10 transects 50 m long (ten replicates) by
   sweeping vegetation (60 sweepings per transect) at night in May 2005 and
   2006.
   Both adults and larvae occurred in all the mentioned types of habitats.
   A high abundance of adults and larvae was recorded in extensive meadows
   mown once a year and in ecotones. The lowest abundance of adults and
   larvae was found in abandoned meadows. The differences between abandoned
   meadows and ecotones (in the case of adults) and between abandoned
   meadows and extensive meadows mown once a year (in the case of larvae)
   were significant in all study years (P <0.05; multiple comparisons, K-W
   ANOVA). In the abandoned meadows the number of adults and larvae
   (median) was approximately 2 to 5 and 5 to 25 times lower than in the
   preferred habitats, respectively. Maximum numbers of both adults and
   larvae per single recording/sampling date were obtained in extensive
   meadows mown once a year; that is 185 adults in a transect 350 m long
   and 4 m wide and 267 larvae in the transect 500 m long (600 sweepings).
   Hence, similar to adults, larvae tend to be habitat generalists. Our
   results have confirmed the ``advantageous{''} life strategy of M.
   jurtina which enables the species to adapt to a wide range of habitats,
   including those under strong pressure from humans. Comparing management
   practices in the study habitats, meadows which are mowed once a year
   were the most appropriate alternative for this species.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Assessments of the conservation status of natural resources have been
   conducted at large (i.e., global, continental, and countrywide) extents.
   Studies at finer scales, however, can yield increased detail needed to
   identify conservation strategies for smaller scales which can contribute
   to goals at the larger extents. Our study was conducted at the scale of
   a single state, San Luis Potosi, in Central Mexico. Although the state
   harbors great biological diversity, large areas covered by natural
   vegetation communities have been and continue to be destroyed by land
   use changes, cattle grazing, and mine-generated pollution. Our purposes
   were to quantify the proportion of distribution within natural protected
   areas (NPAs) of land cover classes, soil types, ecoregions, and
   altitudinal steps. In addition, within individual NPAs, we aimed at
   assessing risks. We conducted our analysis at the 1: 1, 1: 250,000, and
   1: 1,000,000 scales depending on layer availability. Our results show
   that actions within the state could contribute to federal and global
   conservation goals by protecting sites of globally imperiled ecosystems
   (cloud forests and natural grasslands). At a finer scale, we identified
   that piedmont scrubland, medium and low tropical moist forests,
   wetlands, and low elevation habitats are rare and/or constitute
   conservation omissions within the state. Similarly, ecoregions with
   mesquite, semi-deciduous, and moist tropical thorn forest, wetlands, and
   low elevations (<1200 m.a.s.l.) are conservation omissions or gaps.
   Finally, at the smallest scale, risks within some protected areas (PAs)
   include the presence of agriculture, cattle grazing, and mine tailings
   from mines dedicated to extraction of Au, Ag, Cu, Pb, and Zn. Therefore,
   management within these PAs should minimize such risks through
   identification of the most important conservation zones within the PAs,
   and implementation of local legislation prohibiting such activities at
   the immediacies of conservation zones. Approaches like ours within
   similar administrative units will help identify ecosystems that are
   vulnerable and not well protected. However, to prioritize conservation
   action it is also important to consider surrogates such as species from
   different groups and ecosystems, as well as rarity and complementarity
   of such surrogates.}},

Abstract = {{Seed dispersal by livestock in lowland rangelands has received attention
   from researchers in recent decades while there has been little research
   into the dispersal of alpine meadow plants' seed after ingestion by yaks
   and Tibetan sheep. This study assessed the recovery and germination of
   seeds by feeding known quantities of seeds from 20 alpine meadow species
   to yaks and Tibetan sheep. Seeds from 18 out of 20 of the plant species
   fed to Tibetan sheep survived ingestion and defecation. All of the
   species fed to the yaks survived. The recovery rate of undamaged seed
   ranged from 0.4 to 58.4\% for yaks and 0.0 to 28.1\% for Tibetan sheep.
   In general, total recovery of ingested seeds from yaks (28.1\%) was
   significantly higher than that from the sheep (9.4\%). Passage time of
   seeds through the digestive tract ranged from 12 to 96 h for yaks and
   from 12 to 84 h for Tibetan sheep. Seed recovery was negatively related
   to seed length (yak, r = -0.59; Tibetan sheep, r = -0.52) but was not
   related to seed width, seed thickness and seed mass. Seeds defecated by
   yaks and Tibetan sheep were found to have a range of germination rates
   which were both higher and lower compared with undigested seed depending
   on the plant species. It is argued that ingestion of seed by grazing yak
   or Tibetan sheep may have important effects on the population dynamics
   of alpine plant species of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.}},

Title = {{The importance of key marginal habitat features for birds in farmland:
   an assessment of habitat preferences of Red-backed Shrikes Lanius

Volume = {{59}},

Abstract = {{Capsule Key marginal habitat features maintain their importance even
   when they occur at very low density.
   Aims To assess the importance for breeding birds of key habitat
   elements, such as isolated shrubs, hedgerows and untilled vegetation
   patches.
   Methods We investigated the habitat preferences of Red-backed Shrikes
   Lanius collurio in an agricultural environment where key habitat
   elements have been dramatically reduced. Based upon data from
   territorial maps, a fine-scale model of habitat preference was developed
   and the results of three different analytical approaches (binary
   logistic regression, multimodel inference and hierarchical partitioning)
   were compared.
   Results The occurrence of Red-backed Shrikes was positively influenced
   by the extent of non-grazed/mown grassland, isolated bushes and
   hedgerows, and negatively influenced by woodland cover. The model
   high-lighted the importance of bushes/hedgerows despite their very
   scarce occurrence in the study areas (overall, average cover only
   7.94\%). Breeding densities were rather low, but mean densities were
   slightly higher in pasture zones in which bushes/hedgerows availability
   was higher than elsewhere.
   Conclusion These results confirm the crucial importance of these key
   marginal elements even in depauperated farmland landscapes. Maintaining
   and increasing their availability is a key management option for the
   encouragement of breeding Red-backed Shrikes, and potentially for other
   species which are also declining in these farmland habitats.}},

Title = {{Impacts of cross-country ski trails on bog and fen vegetation}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{87-103}},
Abstract = {{Bogs and fens are protected by the EU Habitats Directive as they harbour
   many specialised species and are strongly endangered. In Southern
   Germany, at the foothills of the Alps, a multitude of bogs and fens of
   high nature-conservation value still exist. Cross-country ski trails run
   through some of these peatlands, but little is known about the impact of
   the ski trails on the vegetation. In this study we analyse the impact of
   cross-country ski trails on site conditions, flora and vegetation of
   three peatland types (raised bog, calcareous fen, litter meadow) in
   Southern Bavaria. For each of these types we compare ski-trail plots
   with unaffected control plots. In all three peatland types we observed
   an impact of ski trails. In general, ski trails lead to a levelling of
   ecological gradients, soil compaction and thus, higher soil humidity.
   Several stress- and humidity-tolerant species benefit from the
   modification of the site conditions. In the calcareous fen the impact
   was least severe. This can be explained by the generally higher water
   level and lower sensitivity to soil compaction in comparison to the
   raised bog and the litter meadow. Within the raised bog and the litter
   meadow particularly Trichophorum cespitosum was favoured by
   waterlogging. Moreover, the raised bog developed into a transition bog
   associated with an increase in the number of threatened species. This
   development is certainly favoured by the mulching of the ski trail
   because the raised bog in general is not affected by regular land use.
   Accordingly, the raised-bog species are not adapted to disturbance and
   thus rarely occur on the trail. In contrast, in the regularly mown
   litter meadow a floristic homogenisation with less pronounced flowering
   aspects takes place. The litter meadow with alternating soil moisture
   develops into a more constantly wet habitat, because less competitive
   stress-tolerators are favoured by the trail and the cover of threatened
   species increases.}},

Title = {{Management of grasslands in rewetted floodplains: effects of grazing and
   cutting on vegetation development}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{207-231}},
Abstract = {{Extensive floodplain wetlands of high conservation value have become
   very rare in Central Europe because of river regulation, flood control
   measures, drainage, and melioration. In the recent past, restoration
   measures for water bodies and floodplains have been used specifically to
   promote endangered animal and plant species of open wetlands. In the
   process, harvested pastures, which were formerly used intensively, are
   frequently restored. The question of site management following rewetting
   is important from a practical and economic as well as a conservation
   perspective. Extensive grazing on rewetted floodplain habitats is often
   more feasible than mowing. However, such a management change is often
   contested from a conservation perspective. Within the scope of this
   study, a vegetation analysis is used to compare different land use
   regimes for floodplains in the Luxembourg Syr-wetlands six years after
   rewetting through a land restoration project. The aim is to analyse
   differences in vegetation composition between the management
   alternatives of extensive grazing, one-cut mowing with grazing and
   two-cut mowing, and to draw conclusions for the future management of
   rewetted floodplain wetlands. Along the use limits of pasture-mowing
   areas, vegetation surveys have been carried out using paired sampling
   plots to keep site conditions as similar as possible. Alongside
   parameters for floristic diversity and rarity, the vegetation data have
   also been analysed with the help of indicator values and species traits.
   One dimension of an NMDS-ordination allows the vegetation composition of
   the management alternatives to be significantly distinguished from one
   another. The main influencing factor here is primarily differing land
   use. At the pasture areas investigated, more species were observed
   overall than in the mowing areas. The average species numbers, diversity
   indices, and structural vegetation parameters per unit of measurement
   point to a greater spatial heterogeneity in vegetation under the
   influence of grazing animals. Regarding rare and conservation-relevant
   plant species, no significant differences between the management
   alternatives were recorded. In contrast, the two-cut mowing areas in
   particular differ from the permanent pasture with regard to species
   traits like life-form, reproduction type, and flowering time span. This
   result is not consistent with the species decline associated with a
   management change from mowing to grazing, which has been observed in
   other studies for different site conditions. The extensive mowing and
   grazing use in the Syr floodplain comes close to historical agricultural
   management forms, which are increasingly required for the conservation
   and development of species-rich habitat types. The different land-use
   regimes complement each other in the Syr valley and offer different
   habitats for plant species with varying species traits.}},

Title = {{Vegetation succession and habitat restoration in Dutch lichen-rich
   inland drift sands}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{245-268}},
Abstract = {{Between 1996 and 2006 the vegetation succession in drift sands and in
   blown-out gravel-rich depressions, located in the nature reserve
   Hulshorsterzand in the central Netherlands, was studied. Within this
   Natura 2000 habitat (type 2330: inland dunes with open Corynephorus and
   Agrostis grasslands) so-called lichen steppes are included, famous for
   their biodiversity, both in flora (cryptogams), and in fauna. With
   multivariate analysis, the relation between the primary succession, the
   species composition of the vegetation and the soil quality was studied
   in three different biotopes i.e. 1. drift sand, 2. blown-out gravel-rich
   depressions and 3. drift sand after management. With a total of up to 34
   species, lichen diversity in the study area appeared to be high. Biotope
   I, i.e. the pioneer vegetation with Corynephorus canescens on blowing
   sand, is rather scarce in lichens. Between 1996 and 2006 green algae, C.
   canescens and Polytrichum Piliferum appeared, with the result that much
   of the former open drift sand area was covered by pioneer stages of the
   Spergulo-Corynephoretum. If sand stopped blowing in, a combination of P
   piliferum with the neophyte Campylopus introflexus occurred. The
   terminal stages of lichen succession on drift sand, a vegetation with
   mainly Festuca ovina s.l., Deschampsia flexuosa and reindeer lichens
   (Cladonia subgen. Cladina), proved to be rather stable. Since 1996 the
   lichen steppes occurring in biotope 2 were increasingly
   grass-encroached. Where some sand was still blowing in, lichen diversity
   did not change much, but gradually C. introflexus increased. However,
   without sand blowing-in, a decreasing lichen cover and loss of some Red
   List lichens occurred. In general, in this grass-rich vegetation.
   Calluna vulgaris will germinate and gradually a dry heath might develop.
   However, where dynamics had stopped and Pinus sylvestris seedlings
   established, succession to a young forest started. Vegetation change
   from open sand to lichen-rich vegetation is clearly related to a
   decrease in pH, an increase in organic matter, in \% total N and in \%
   total P. The lichen composition is clearly related to this gradient. The
   applied restoration measures on steep sand dunes in the eastern area,
   both of cutting pine trees and removing topsoil down to the mineral soil
   layer, proved to be successful. The sand kept drifting and the pioneer
   community thriving, including the lichen Stereocaulon condensatum
   characteristic of pioneer conditions, while the neophytic moss hardly
   increased between 1996 and 2006.}},

Title = {{Cryptogams in calcareous grassland restoration: perspectives for
   artificial vs. natural colonization}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{269-279}},
Abstract = {{Cryptogams form a large part of dry grassland plant species richness. As
   a frequently used tool in grassland restoration, hay transfer is known
   to transfer cryptogam species. This might result in cryptogam stands
   differing from those achieved by natural succession. To assess hay
   transfer as a medium for cryptogam restoration, I analysed species
   composition of cryptogams in the hay of dry grasslands in Southern
   Germany, how fast they establish, and how fast they colonize adjacent
   plots. Cryptogam samples from hay showed species combinations similar to
   those of the mown sites and large shoot numbers to be present in the
   hay. Even low-growing and rare species were found in the hay. Hay
   receptor sites showed larger pleurocarpous moss and fruticose lichen
   patches than comparable sites without hay transfer, indicating earlier
   arrival of viable diaspores at the receptor sites. For acrocarpous
   mosses that colonize new sites by spores, no differences in turf size
   between succession and restoration plots were found. This shows that
   species transferred by hay have a distinct advantage over species that
   have to arrive at newly opened sites by natural means, i.e. many years
   later. The colonization from small restoration sites into adjacent areas
   without hay transfer proceeds with moderate speeds of about 1 to 2 m per
   year, probably with wind drift as the most important dispersal agent.
   Abundant cryptogam species including most pleurocarpous mosses and some
   Cladonia species rarely producing spores will be greatly enhanced by hay
   transfer. Nevertheless, the facilitation of pleurocarpous mosses may be
   detrimental to acrocarpous moss and epigaeic and saxicolous lichen
   species diversity, which should be considered in dry grassland
   restoration. I suggest a combination of different restoration measures
   in a mosaic pattern to create suitable conditions for a maximum of
   cryptogam species.}},

Title = {{Festuco-Brometea communities of the Transylvanian Plateau (Romania) - a
   preliminary overview on syntaxonomy, ecology, and biodiversity}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{319-359}},
Abstract = {{The Transylvanian Plateau in Romania is well known to host large areas
   of a variety of dry grassland types, still traditionally managed by
   low-intensity mowing or grazing. While this natural heritage is now
   under threat from changes in agricultural practices, the diversity of
   Transylvanian dry grasslands is still little understood. There is a lack
   of both field data sampled with standardised methods and a syntaxonomic
   treatment with modern statistical methods and supra-regional
   perspective. Therefore, the European Dry Grassland Group (EDGG) carried
   out its first international Research Expedition in Transylvania 2009 to
   study syntaxonomy, vegetation-environment relationships, and
   biodiversity patterns of these communities. In various locations across
   Transylvania, we sampled 10-m(2) vegetation plots (n = 82) and
   nested-plot series from 0.0001 m(2) to 100 m(2) (n = 20), including all
   vascular plant, bryophyte, and lichen species, as well as structural and
   soil data. The vegetation classification was carried out with modified
   TWINSPAN, followed by determination of diagnostic species with phi
   values and a small-scale re-assignment of releves with the aim of
   crispness maximisation. Both TWINSPAN and ordination revealed three
   major groups of syntaxa, which were matched to three orders from the
   class of basiphilous dry grasslands, Festuco-Brometea, represented by
   one alliance each: rocky dry grasslands (Stipo pulcherrimae-Festucetalia
   pallentis: Seslerion rigidae); xeric grasslands on deep soils
   (Festucetalia valesiacae: Stipion lessingianae) and meso-xeric
   grasslands on deep soils (Brachypodietalia pinnati: Cirsio-Brachypodion
   pinnati). We accepted nine association-level units plus two that
   potentially merit association status but were only represented by one
   releve each. Most of the units could be identified with one or several
   previously described associations. To support nomenclatural stability,
   we provide a nomenclatural revision and designate nomenclatural types
   where previously there were none. Further, we used DCA ordination and
   analysis of variance to determine the main environmental drivers of
   floristic differentiation and to determine ecological and structural
   differences between the vegetation types. The strongest differentiation
   occurred along the aridity gradient with the dense, particularly diverse
   stands on more or less level sites on the one hand (Brachypodietalia
   pinnati) and the more open, less diverse stands on steep south-facing
   slopes on the other end of the gradient (Stipo pulcherrimae-Festucetalia
   pallentis, Festucetalia valesiacae). The two xeric orders were then
   separated along the second DCA axis, with the Stipo
   pulcherrimae-Festucetalia pallentis inhabiting the stone-rich sites at
   higher altitudes while the Festucetalia valesiacae occur on soft, deep
   substrata at lower altitudes. The analysed dry grassland communities
   have extraordinarily high a-diversity at all spatial scales for all
   plants and for vascular plants, but are relatively poor in bryophytes
   and lichens. Some formerly mown stands of the Festuco
   sulcatae-Brachypodietum pinnati (Brachypodietalia pinnati) are even
   richer in vascular plant species than any other recorded vegetation type
   worldwide on the spatial scales of 0.1 m(2) (43) and 10 m(2) (98); the
   respective releves are documented here for the first time. Also, the
   beta-diversity of the grasslands was unexpectedly high, with a mean
   z-value of 0.275.
   Despite its limited extent, the methodological thoroughness of this
   study allows us to shed new light on the syntaxonomy of dry grasslands
   in Romania and to raise the awareness that Transylvania still hosts High
   Nature Value grasslands that are biodiversity hotspots at a global scale
   but at the same time are highly endangered through changes in
   agricultural practices.}},

Abstract = {{The present study examined a sub-Mediterranean pastoral system in the
   central Apennines (Italy) with a long history of grazing, where winter
   cold stress is alternated with summer drought stress. The research goals
   were to ascertain whether different floristic structures correspond to
   different stress conditions (xeric and semimesic), and whether peculiar
   functional plant traits (such as avoidance and tolerance mechanisms)
   respond to stress/disturbance intensities, and understand how vegetation
   reacts to changeable livestock pressure (through floristic and plant
   trait variations). Cluster analysis indicated that separate communities
   develop under different stress intensities. Other analyses highlighted
   how avoidance strategies predominate within the pastoral system.
   Observations of grazed and ungrazed patches conducted in 10-m transects
   revealed spiny cushion formation in semimesic grassland, where a brief
   period of overgrazing occurs in late summer, causing variations in plant
   community structure. All these results confirm the importance of
   historical grazing and current land use, showing how small disturbances
   and stress variations cause ecosystem responses. Best practices for
   management were identified. In xeric conditions, it is advisable that
   the intensity of disturbance be lessened, while in semimesic grassland
   overgrazing should be forbidden during the dry period, because it could
   facilitate the development of spiny patches, and subsequent spread of
   Brachypodium rupestre.}},

Volume = {{207}},

Abstract = {{Conservation of grassland biodiversity is a key issue in the EU
   agro-biodiversity policy. We assessed the effects of yearly mowing on
   target forb biomass in years with contrasting precipitation (2006-2007)
   in mountain fen and dry-mesophilous hay meadows in NE-Hungary. We
   hypothesised: (i) Species richness and biomass of target forbs is higher
   in mown than in abandoned stands. (ii) Mowing has more an effect on the
   biomass of target forbs, graminoids and litter than precipitation.
   Mowing increased the species richness of forbs and target forbs. The
   biomass of forbs and target forbs was not affected by mowing because of
   the specific responses of certain forbs. The majority of target species
   were supported, but tall forbs (Succisa pratensis; Lathyrus pratensis)
   were suppressed by mowing. Precipitation affected only the amount of
   litter in dry-mesophilous meadows and forb biomass in fen meadows. In
   the dry year, the biomass of target forbs decreased but the proportion
   of the species did not change. Our results showed that mowing is
   necessary to maintain overall plant biodiversity in hay meadows by
   removal of graminoid biomass and litter, but not all target forbs were
   favoured by regular yearly mowing. Decreased mowing frequency (mowing in
   every second or third year) on the entire meadow or temporarily changing
   mosaics of mown and unmown stripes might be the most suitable management
   option for maintaining the highest biodiversity of forbs. (C) 2012

   vertebrate fauna of a tropical savanna}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{173-182}},
Abstract = {{Grazing by domestic livestock is one of the most widespread uses of the
   rangelands of Australia. There is limited information on the effects of
   grazing by domestic livestock on the vertebrate fauna of Australia and
   the establishment of a long-term grazing experiment in north-eastern
   Queensland at Wambiana provided an opportunity to attempt an examination
   of the changes in vertebrate fauna as a consequence of the manipulation
   of stocking rates. The aim was to identify what the relative effects of
   vegetation type, stocking rate and other landscape-scale environmental
   factors were on the patterns recorded. Sixteen 1-ha sites were
   established within three replicated treatments (moderate, heavy and
   variable stocking rates). The sites were sampled in the wet and dry
   seasons in 1999-2000 (T-0) and again in 2003-04 (T-1). All paddocks of
   the treatments were burnt in 1999. Average annual rainfall declined
   markedly between the two sampling periods, which made interpretation of
   the data difficult. A total of 127 species of vertebrate fauna
   comprising five amphibian, 83 bird, 27 reptile and 12 mammal species
   were recorded. There was strong separation in faunal composition from
   T-0 to T-1 although changes in mean compositional dissimilarity between
   the grazing stocking rate treatments were less well defined. There was a
   relative change in abundance of 24 bird, four mammal and five reptile
   species from T-0 to T-1. The generalised linear modelling identified
   that, in the T-1 data, there was significant variation in the abundance
   of 16 species explained by the grazing and vegetation factors. This
   study demonstrated that vertebrate fauna assemblage did change and that
   these changes were attributable to the interplay between the stocking
   rates, the vegetation types on the sites surveyed, the burning of the
   experimental paddocks and the decrease in rainfall over the course of
   the two surveys. It is recommended that the experiment is sampled again
   but that the focus should be on a rapid survey of abundant taxa (i.e.
   birds and reptiles) to allow an increase in the frequency of sampling
   and replication of the data. This would help to articulate more clearly
   the trajectory of vertebrate change due to the relative effects of
   stocking rates compared with wider landscape environmental changes.
   Given the increasing focus on pastoral development in northern
   Australia, any opportunity to incorporate the collection of data on
   biodiversity into grazing manipulation experiments should be taken for
   the assessment of the effects of land management on faunal species.}},

Abstract = {{The invasion of exotic plants into savanna ecosystems can disrupt the
   natural pattern of vegetation. Indian couch Bothriochloa pertusa was
   introduced into Australia as a species for rehabilitation of degraded
   grazing land. In this study the effect of increasing B. pertusa cover on
   native plant diversity and possible mechanisms of its spread were
   examined. Forty sites were sampled in uncleared Queensland rangelands
   with a range of B. pertusa and Bothriochloa ewartiana (a native species)
   cover. The mean number of native species per quadrat declined with
   increasing B. pertusa cover but remained stable over sites with
   increasing B. ewartiana cover. Mean species richness accumulated at a
   significantly lower rate for sites with B. pertusa present. Canonical
   analysis of principle coordinates suggested that three groups of sites,
   ranging from low to high species richness and cover of native plants,
   were correlated along gradients of B. pertusa cover, grazing intensity
   and basal area of dead trees. Generalised linear modelling indicated
   significant negative relationships between B. pertusa cover and total
   ground cover, forbs and perennial grass richness and cover, and cover of
   nine native perennial tussock grasses (Aristida leptopoda, B. decipiens,
   B. ewartiana, Chrysopogon fallax, Dichanthium fecundum, D. sericeum,
   Heteropogon contortus, H. triticeus and Themeda triandra). This study
   suggests that an increase in B. pertusa is associated with a substantial
   change in the cover and species richness of native plant communities.
   This was considered to occur via competitive effects as well as a result
   of cattle grazing, rainfall deficit and tree death. Regardless of the
   mechanism, continued spread of exotic pasture species has the potential
   to cause significant changes to rangeland biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Perennial vegetation is one of the most valuable ecological components

   In various countries, increasing attention is being paid to research

   meadows was conducted from 2003 to 2006 with the aim to determine how
   the regime of management and different ecological conditions over
   several years influences floristic composition, frequency, and stability
   of meadow sward. Field sampling plots were set up on two semi-natural
   floodplain meadows in protected areas: in the meadow of the Minija
   mid-river banks (used for agricultural activities - grazing and
   cutting), and in the VeivirZas landscape reserve in the flood-meadow
   land (with no farming activities for the last ten years). The article
   discusses the relevance of the dominant species on the stability of
   phytocenoses. Each habitat was estimated for ecological conditions, i.e.
   soil moisture and vascular plant species indicating soil acidity.}},

Title = {{Vegetation and soil seed bank relationships across microhabitats in an
   abandoned Quercus suber parkland under simulated fire}},
Journal = {{ECOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Abstract = {{Mediterranean agro-forestry systems are undergoing rapid change due to
   abandonment. This turns formerly cultivated or grazed oak-tree parklands
   (i.e., savanna-type formations called ``dehesas{''}) into flammable
   formations of scattered trees within a matrix of shrubs with open
   spaces. Wildfires can now occur, threatening the persistence of these
   formations. Fire-prone shrublands commonly regenerate after fire from
   seeds stored in the soil. Understanding the relationships between
   standing vegetation and the soil seed bank across microhabitats can help
   predict the response of the system in case of fire. Here we investigated
   these relationships in an abandoned Quercus suber (cork oak) dehesa in
   central Spain. Vegetation and soil were sampled and assigned to
   different microhabitats: under the trees (TRC), in dense shrub cover
   (DSC), and in low shrub cover (LSC). A heat shock was applied to half of
   each sample to simulate fire; the other half served as control. Both
   sets of samples were then germinated in a greenhouse. Almost 90\% of the
   species were herbs, while the rest were woody shrubs. The number of
   species recorded in TRC and DSC was lower than in LSC, in which species
   richness, particularly herbs, was maximal. Heating increased the total
   number of species that germinated, but mean species richness per sample
   was not altered. Heating markedly increased the number of germinations
   in all microhabitats, particularly those of woody species. Furthermore,
   the germination of shrubby species increased in the 3 microhabitats,
   notably in TRC. While the standing plant community was well
   differentiated among microhabitats, this was not the case for the soil
   seed bank, which was homogeneous across microhabitats, with or without
   heating. We conclude that the high density of shrubby seeds found in TRC
   or in the other microhabitats presents substantial threats to the
   persistence of Q. suber parklands in case of fire.}},

Title = {{An orchid colonization credit in restored calcareous grasslands}},
Journal = {{ECOSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{21-28}},
Abstract = {{Habitat restoration comprises the re-creation of suitable environmental
   conditions with the intention of recolonization by certain target
   species. In previously abandoned calcareous grasslands, however, many
   characteristic plant species have been reported missing even decades
   after the reinstatement of traditional mowing or grazing management.
   Such grasslands are said to exhibit a colonization credit. This may be
   particularly true for orchid species, which often rely on highly
   specialized pollination strategies and mycorrhizal associations for
   completion of their life-cycle. In this study, we investigated whether
   restored calcareous grasslands exhibited an orchid colonization credit,
   whether this credit was associated with the degree of grassland
   fragmentation, and with particular species' life history traits.
   Applying the Beals index as a quantitative method to identify suitable
   habitats, several orchid species were indeed found missing from
   grasslands deemed suitable. There was no relation, however, between the
   extent of the colonization credit and the spatial isolation or size of
   the grasslands. Of all life history traits examined, only a high degree
   of pollinator specialization could be related to delayed colonization.
   This may suggest that restoring the pollinator community is an important
   bottleneck in calcareous grassland restoration.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing is an established conservation tool for maintaining grassland
   habitats and under some circumstances may enrich arthropod assemblages.
   However, even if enrichment occurs, it is not granted that conservation
   value signified by rare and specialist species will also increase. To
   assess how some preset levels of grazing suit conservation aims, we
   studied spider assemblages of ungrazed, sparsely grazed and intensively
   grazed areas of a pasture in Hungary for three years by pitfall trapping
   and suction sampling. At ground level there was no significant
   difference among grazing areas, while at higher strata increasing
   grazing intensity negatively affected number of individuals and species.
   C-score analysis indicated equally neutral community assembly in all
   three grazing areas. All statistical methods that took into account
   species identity indicated virtually no difference between the spider
   assemblages of the sparsely grazed and ungrazed areas; however, there
   was a marked difference between these and the intensively grazed area.
   Spider species in the intensive grazing area had significantly lower
   affinity but wider tolerance for habitat naturalness, preferred more
   open habitats and had a lower rarity status. In the intensive grazing
   area a number of disturbance-tolerant species, among them agrobionts,
   were present, whereas the exclusion of rare or specialist species in the
   intensively grazed area occurred infrequently. The primary effect seen
   at the intensive grazing area was the opening of the spider assemblage
   to disturbance-tolerant species, while species richness was likely
   maintained by neighboring source populations. Overall, we experienced a
   marked decrease in the naturalness status of the spider assemblage in
   the intensive grazing area.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{13-23}},
Abstract = {{Background and aims - Intense agriculture phases on old plant
   communities, such as Mediterranean steppes, can lead to low resilience.
   Two main obstacles to the spontaneous recolonization of these plant
   communities are often the low dispersal of target species and the high
   dispersal and establishment potential of unwanted species. The aim of
   the study is to find the most efficient restoration treatments to
   restore these plant communities.
   Methods - After the rehabilitation of an herbaceous sheep-grazed
   community on a formerly intensively cultivated orchard in the last
   French Mediterranean steppe (La Crau, Provence, France), four
   experimental restoration treatments were applied to restore the steppe
   plant community: (i) topsoil removal to lower ruderal species seed banks
   and soil trophic levels, (ii) nurse species seeding to rapidly occupy
   niches, and then to provide safe sites for target species once sheep
   grazing is reintroduced, (iii) hay transfer to provide local species
   seeds, and (iv) soil transfer to provide local species propagules with
   associated microorganisms. One year later, plant species richness,
   composition and diversity are compared.
   Results - Although the communities developing on areas seeded with nurse
   species and where topsoil was removed differed most widely from the
   reference ecosystem, i.e. steppe, these restoration treatments succeeded
   in achieving their goal by significantly lowering the abundance of
   unwanted dominant species. While hay transfer did not have a
   significantly higher species richness than that of the rehabilitated
   area, it showed promising results, as some germinations of target
   species were observed. One year only after the treatment was applied,
   soil transfer provided a community richness and composition very close
   to that of the reference ecosystem, but not with the same vegetation
   structure.
   Conclusion - In order to restore plant community composition, the more
   the treatment strengthens community dispersal, the more efficient it is.
   The gain in efficiency is closely linked with the cost of the treatment.}},

Journal = {{KOEDOE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{1}},
Abstract = {{The objective of the proposed Highveld National Park (HNP) is to
   conserve a considerable area of the poorly conserved Rocky Highveld
   Grassland and Dry Sandy Highveld Grassveld of the western Grassland
   Biome in South Africa. The park has not yet been proclaimed, but is
   currently under the management of the North West Parks and Tourism
   Board. The main aim of this study was to classify and describe the
   vegetation in the Spitskop area in the HNP. The areas affected by soil
   degradation were on the midslopes, footslopes, valley bottomland and the
   floodplains around the Spitskop hill. The concentrated grazing around
   the Spitskop area was also influenced by the existing dam in the
   floodplains. Floristic and soil degradation data were collected and used
   to classify and describe the plant communities of the Spitskop area.
   Vegetation sampling was performed by means of the Braun-Blanquet method
   and a total of twenty plots were sampled. A numerical classification
   technique (TWINSPAN) was applied to the floristic data to derive a first
   approximation of the main plant communities. Further refinement was
   achieved by Braun-Blanquet procedures. The final results of the
   classification procedure were presented in the form of a
   phytosociological table, with three major communities and three
   subcommunities being described. Canonical correspondence analysis was
   used to determine the direct correlation between plant communities and
   soil degradation types. Soil compaction and sheet erosion were found to
   be the most significant variables determining plant community
   composition. Rill and gully erosion were shown to be of lesser
   significance in explaining the variation in plant communities.
   Conservation implications: Grasslands are amongst the most threatened
   biomes in South Africa, yet less than 1.3\% are currently being
   conserved. The HNP has significant value for biodiversity conservation
   and the protection of this area will contribute to the preservation of
   the highly threatened Highveld vegetation types.}},

Abstract = {{There is much concern that the functioning of ecosystems will be
   affected by human-induced changes in biodiversity, of which land-use
   change is the most important driver. However, changes in biodiversity
   may be only one of many pathways through which land use alters ecosystem
   functioning, and its importance relative to other pathways remains
   unclear. In particular, although biodiversity-ecosystem function
   research has focused primarily on grasslands, the increases in
   agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilization, irrigation) and grazing
   pressure that drive change in grasslands worldwide have been largely
   ignored. Here we show that long-term (27-year) manipulations of soil
   resource availability and sheep grazing intensity caused marked,
   consistent shifts in grassland plant functional composition and
   diversity, with cascading (i.e., causal chains of) direct, indirect, and
   interactive effects on multiple ecosystem functions. Resource
   availability exerted dominant control over above-ground net primary
   production (ANPP), both directly and indirectly via shifts in plant
   functional composition. Importantly, the effects of plant functional
   diversity and grazing intensity on ANPP shifted from negative to
   positive as agricultural inputs increased, providing strong evidence
   that soil resource availability modulates the impacts of plant diversity
   and herbivory on primary production. These changes in turn altered
   litter decomposition and, ultimately, soil carbon sequestration,
   highlighting the relevance of ANPP as a key integrator of ecosystem
   functioning. Our study reveals how human alterations of bottom-up
   (resources) and top-down (herbivory) forces together interact to control
   the functioning of grazing systems, the most extensive land use on
   Earth.}},

Abstract = {{Brachypodium pinnatum belongs to native grasses which could dramatically
   decrease the biodiversity of calcareous grasslands, therefore, an
   examination of the mechanisms of its expansion is of prime importance
   for their conservation. We studied the genetic structure of 12
   subpopulations of the expansive grass B. pinnatum in a heterogeneous
   landscape with AFLP markers, aiming at determination whether spatial
   isolation influences the genetic diversity and the population genetic
   structure of this species. A high level of overall (79\%) and within
   population polymorphic loci (38-44\%) were found and 220 different
   genotypes were distinguished among the 252 samples analysed. No
   significant population structure nor isolation-by-distance were found,
   despite their long-time fragmentation history. This confirms that
   isolation of calcareous grasslands in a landscape cannot prevent the
   expansion of B. pinnatum grasses because of the high generative
   dispersal ability. Subsequent quick and extensive clonal growth of this
   species enables the successful establishment. In most cases mowing or
   grazing is sufficient to keep this species at a low density within
   ancient grasslands and to prevent seed and pollen dispersal, but not for
   restoration of species-rich calcareous grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{The number of ground-nesting bird species in meadows, one of the most
   vulnerable habitats in the ornithological reserve of Vrana Lake Nature
   Park has decreased in recent decades. Nest survival rates were
   investigated in meadows and reed beds using nest predation experiments
   in late March and in May 2005. Predators damaged 18\% of the 50
   artificial nests placed in the pasture meadow habitat in March and 22\%
   in May. Daily survival rate of nests were found to be similar in March
   (97\%) and May (96\%). In May, 64\% of 25 nests located in the reed bed
   were discovered by the predators, with the daily survival rate of nests
   (90\%) being significantly lower than that of nests in the nearby
   meadow. The results suggest that the reasons for the decreasing number
   of nesting bird species may be - instead of the pronounced presence and
   activity of predators in the area - the shrinkage of meadow area, the
   lack of buffer zone, the proximity of agricultural lands, and
   disturbance caused by intensive grazing.}},

Abstract = {{The forest ecosystems in northern Europe have undergone extensive
   changes over the last 200 years. We present the first detailed account
   on how modern forest management has transformed a beech (Fagus
   sylvatica) dominated forest landscape in southern Sweden. Specifically,
   we analyse changes in forest distribution, composition and structure
   since 1840 at Skabersjo estate and discuss the implications for forest
   biodiversity. Skabersjo estate is a representative example for the
   development of semi-open wood pastures into managed dense forests for
   timber production. This development was part of a long-term process
   during which changing socio-economic conditions initiated a pervasive
   change of the Swedish forest landscape, including increasing total
   forest areas and timber stocks but decreasing relative shares of
   broadleaved trees. The successful transition to net reforestation
   starting in the mid-nineteenth century benefitted from a new scientific
   approach to forest management and the banning of forest grazing. At
   Skabersjo estate, the introduction of organised forestry resulted in
   steadily increasing timber yields, but the associated changes in forest
   structure and composition also changed habitat conditions for many
   species associated to temperate broadleaved trees. A strong decline of
   old beech trees has resulted in a lower habitat availability for
   specialised epiphytic and saproxylic species.}},

Abstract = {{Anthropogenic activities have resulted in extensive deforestation and
   forest degradation on many tropical oceanic islands. For instance, some
   islands in the Solomon archipelago have as little as 10\% of primary
   forests remaining with few of these remnants protected from future land
   use change. We examine the plant species and functional diversity
   (excluding adult canopy trees) of 48 sites from four forest land use
   types (two types of primary forest, secondary forest and abandoned tree
   plantations) and two common human-maintained land use types (coconut
   plantations and grazed pastures) across three elevation bands on
   Kolombangara Island, Solomon Islands. In total, we surveyed 384 species
   from 86 families of which only 6.5\% were non-native. Species richness
   was lowest in coconut plantations and grazed pastures and declined with
   increasing elevation across all land use types. Functional diversity was
   similar between primary and secondary forest (high richness, high
   evenness and unaltered dispersion) and lowest in coconut plantations and
   grazed pastures. Our results suggest that species and functional
   richness have had divergent responses to land use change in forest land
   uses indicative of a loss of functional redundancy. Despite structural
   and compositional similarities among primary forests and degraded forest
   land uses, full recovery of secondary and commercial plantations has not
   been achieved. We suggest that conservation of Kolombangara's forest
   understory flora will require reserves across the island's elevation
   gradient and may require active restoration in the future, particularly
   if degrading activities continue at the current rate. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {{Sward management influences fruiting of grassland basidiomycete fungi}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{145}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{234-240}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The loss of semi-natural grasslands in Europe, largely though
   ploughing/reseeding and synthetic fertiliser inputs, has caused a severe
   reduction in the diversity and abundance of grassland macrofungi. Of
   these, it is the colourful members of the genus Hygrocybe spp. (waxcaps)
   that have received most conservation attention, with current management
   prescriptions recommending the avoidance of fertiliser additions and
   maintenance of a short sward. However, the latter recommendation is
   based solely on empirical observations and is at odds with management
   strategies aimed at the conservation of many other groups of biota. In
   order to test the effect of sward height on macrofungal fruiting, a
   field experiment was established at a grassland site known to contain
   diverse populations (>50 species) of grassland fungi. Replicated 80 m(2)
   plots (n = 5) were subjected to mowing at 3 cm or 8 cm either from May
   or July onwards, as well as a late haycut to 3 cm in September or no
   mowing at all. Macrofungal fruitbodies were counted in fortnightly
   surveys during the autumn. Species richness and fruitbody numbers were
   greatest on plots mown to 3 cm, either continually or following a July
   haycut, with hardly any fruitbodies formed on uncut plots. Panaeolus
   acuminatus and Entoloma conferendum showed atypical responses, fruiting
   most prolifically on 8 cm-cut and September-cut plots respectively. Thus
   haycutting followed by maintenance of a short sward, a regime also
   compatible with maintaining diversity of many grassland plants and
   invertebrates, is conducive to abundant fruiting of diverse grassland
   fungi. The formation of fruitbodies is important for wider appreciation
   of these fungi and useful for their routine monitoring but further
   information about below-ground mycelial dynamics is urgently required.

Abstract = {{The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functions of
   grasslands has received increasing attention in recent years. So far,
   experiments were mostly conducted in experimental grasslands. We used a
   different approach on permanent grassland by applying herbicides
   selective against either dieots or monocots. This allowed us to alter
   plant species composition and evenness and to obtain altered
   constellations of functional group abundances without deliberate
   introduction of new species or continued disturbance by weeding. The
   resulting swards were subjected to different management intensities in
   terms of cutting regime and fertilization. Compared to the baseline data
   before herbicide application, within one year, the combination of
   treatments, especially the herbicide application, led to a broad variety
   of swards with the herbicide treatment alone accounting for more than
   25\% of the variance in composition. We conclude that the application of
   specific herbicides is a method highly suitable for creating different
   sward types, because the swards differed significantly in species
   number, evenness and composition of functional groups without showing
   signs of disturbance, as neither the area of open soil nor the
   proportion of annual colonizer species increased.}},

Title = {{Functional diversity of species-rich managed grasslands in response to

Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{20-31}},
Abstract = {{Predicting plant functional composition of managed grasslands in
   response to stress (nutrients and temperature) and disturbance (grazing
   and cutting) is still a challenge. We aim to examine two issues. (i) Is
   the leaf dry matter content (LDMC) of Poaceae species (g) weighted by
   their abundance (LDMCgw) an appropriate indicator of grassland response
   to stress and disturbance? Comparison was done for stress and
   disturbance was assessed through proxy variables describing abiotic
   conditions (altitude) and management (fertilization practices and three
   defoliation regimes) or through measured indicators (temperature, N
   availability and canopy height at the time of defoliation). (ii) Does
   the degree of disturbance that maximises functional diversity increase
   as productivity increases? Using the distribution of the specific LDMCg
   values in the analyzed plant communities as a measure of functional
   diversity (FD), we explore its response to the gradients of stress and
   disturbance. For 136 vegetation datasets (meadows and pastures)
   recorded, the N-Ellenberg indicator value (N-Ell) was calculated to
   assess nutrient availability, and canopy height was measured. We show
   that LDMCgw was significantly negatively correlated with temperature, N
   fertilizer rate or N-Ell and canopy height (greater for meadows than for
   pastures). There was a parabolic relationship between FD and LDMCgw only
   if the temperature, the N-Ell and the defoliation regimes are considered
   together. This suggests the following framework for explaining the
   response of FD to stress and disturbance by a single plant trait: low
   stress (high temperature and nutrients) and high plant competition for
   light resulting from cutting favour plants with an exploitative
   strategy; high stress (low temperature and nutrients) and low plant
   competition for light resulting from grazing favour plants with a
   conservative strategy; intermediate stress favours the coexistence of
   both plant strategies for cutting as well for grazing. This framework
   can be used to define combinations of management practices and
   environmental factors, allowing a variety of management objectives to be
   achieved.}},

Title = {{Equivalence in the strength of deer herbivory on above and below ground
   communities}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{59-66}},
Abstract = {{Herbivores exert a strong influence on the species composition and
   richness of plant communities, but the magnitude of their effect on
   belowground communities remains poorly understood. While an increasing
   number of studies acknowledge the importance of documenting belowground
   effects of herbivores, very few of these evaluate variation in the
   strength of the response from aboveground to belowground communities.
   Our study documents the long-term consequences of sustained deer
   herbivory for plant and arthropod communities adjacent to 15 exclosures
   that have been in place since 1996. We hypothesized that herbivory would
   alter the composition and diversity of communities, but the strength of
   the effects of herbivory would weaken from plants, to leaf-litter
   invertebrates, and to belowground microarthropod communities. First, we
   found that herbivory negatively impacted plant seedling and sapling
   abundance and performance, reduced the abundance of ants and the
   taxonomic richness of arthropods in the litter layer and reduced the
   richness of soil microarthropod communities. Second, in contrast to our
   hypothesis, the magnitude of effect size did not vary among trophic
   levels, indicating that effects of deer herbivory cascade from plants to
   the leaf-litter and soil arthropod communities with equal strength.
   While much recent research has focused on how specific traits of plants
   may mediate the effects of herbivory on associated species, our results
   suggest that indirect effects of herbivory might influence many
   components of belowground communities.}},

Abstract = {{Research has delivered convincing findings on the effect of biodiversity
   on ecosystem functioning and humankind. Indeed, ecosystems provide
   provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services. The global
   value of annual ecosystem services of grasslands and rangelands is about
   US\$ 232 ha(-1) year(-1). Nevertheless, the precise evaluation of
   biodiversity benefits remains challenging. This issue is due to
   valuation methods, subjective assumptions, and complexity of drivers of
   plant community dynamics. Here, we review the primary factors that
   influence plant diversity of permanent grasslands, and we describe
   underlying processes. These factors must indeed be identified to focus
   policies meant to preserve and restore plant diversity and to advise
   farmers about efficient decision rules. We show that plant dynamics of
   permanent grasslands cannot be explained simply by agricultural
   management rules, e.g., grazing, fertilization, and mowing, implemented
   at the field scale. The configuration of the surrounding landscape,
   e.g., landscape heterogeneity, habitat fragmentation, and connectivity,
   acts as a species filter that defines the regional species pool and
   controls seed flow. The regional species pool often contains higher
   species richness in a heterogeneous landscape, because of a higher
   diversity of suitable habitats. This regional pool could be a major
   species sources for permanent grasslands according to the seed flow. We
   discuss the need to consider all of these factors to understand plant
   species composition of permanent grasslands and the necessity to study
   plant communities using both taxonomic and functional approaches. In
   order to report this integrative approach, we propose a conceptual model
   based on three ecological challenges-dispersal, establishment, and
   persistence-that are considered to act as filters on plant diversity,
   and a graphical representation of the complexity of such studies due to
   the interaction effects between plant dispersal abilities, forage
   productivity, disturbances induced by farming practices, and landscape
   heterogeneity on plant diversity. Last, we discuss the ability of
   farmers to manage each factor and the necessity of such study in the
   improvement of the current agro-environment schemes efficiency for
   farmland biodiversity restoration or preservation.}},

   continuous and rotational grazing systems effect upon biomass, fractions

   (Species Richness, Shannon-Wiener) and beta (Jaccard and Magurran)
   biodiversity for a period of four years in a P. radiata silvopastoral
   system. The experiment consisted of a randomized block design of two
   treatments (continuous and rotational grazing). Biomass, and species
   abundances were measured - biodiversity metrics were calculated based on
   these results for a two years of grazing and two years of post-grazing
   periods. Both continuous and rotational grazing systems were useful
   tools for reducing biomass and, therefore, fire risk. The rotational
   grazing system caused damage to the U. europaeus shrub, limiting its
   recovery once grazing was stopped. However, the more intensive grazing
   of U. europaeus plants under rotational had a positive effect on both
   alpha and beta biodiversity indexes due to the low capacity of food
   selection in the whole plot rather than continuous grazing systems.
   Biomass was not affected by the grazing system; however the rotational
   grazing system is more appropriate to reduce U. europaeus biomass and
   therefore forest fire risk at a long term and to enhance pasture
   biodiversity than the continuous grazing system.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{Due to the European Habitats Directive, Quercus pyrenaica habitat has
   been protected within the Natura 2000 network for biodiversity
   conservation. Many of these habitats have been widely managed as coppice
   forest with silvopastoral use throughout Spain. Currently, in many of
   these oak coppices fuelwood extraction is neglected and grazing is the
   main use. Management plans required in the Directive should consider all
   these circumstances and offer an integrated approach to ensure a
   favourable conservation status of these habitats. We propose a three
   phase methodology to assess the ability of the habitat to support a
   given livestock density annually and seasonally, and to evaluate some of
   the physical impacts of grazing animals on the physical structure and
   development of the habitat. We applied the methodology to a neglected
   coppice forest that supports livestock at different periods. Results
   show that there is a possible compatibility between annual livestock
   food requirements and pasture production. Current grazing periods seem
   to fit the seasonal pasture productivity. Negative impacts were assessed
   on oak shrubland stands due to intense browsing and on low polewood
   owing to the high density of broken trees. On more developed stands,
   positive livestock impact was due to the control of the regrowth of
   coppice shoots. Acorn absence is a result of the previous coppice
   management. This negative impact may endanger long-term viability of Q.
   pyrenaica in the study area. We propose a process of conversion into
   high forest through a sequence of thinning to start sexual regeneration.
   In this proposal, livestock have an important role to ensure
   biodiversity, control the regrowth of coppice shoots and thinning low
   polewood stands. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

   high recent rate of abandonment of arable lands in Central and Eastern
   Europe. Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of sowing two
   low-diversity seed mixtures followed by annual mowing, a frequently used
   restoration technique, in weed suppression. We found that rapidly
   forming cover of sown grasses effectively suppressed short-lived weeds
   and their germination except in the first year. The detected dense seed
   bank of short-lived weeds points out the possibility and threat of later
   weed infestation. In the short run perennial weeds cannot be suppressed
   easily by sowing and annual mowing. We found that the effectiveness of
   seed sowing followed by mowing in weed suppression can be different on
   sites with different history or seed mixture. Rapidly establishing
   perennial weeds, such as Agropyron species were only detected in former
   alfalfa fields; Cirsium arvense was found in former cereal and sunflower
   fields but not in former alfalfa fields. We found that the rate of weed
   suppression and success was influenced by the seed mixtures used. In
   several alkali restorations the high proportion of perennial weeds was
   detected in year 3. In loess restorations, much lower scores were
   typical. This was likely caused by the different seed mixture used. The
   loess seed mixture contained seeds of a clonally spreading tall-grass,
   Bromus inermis, which could compete more effectively with clonally
   spreading weeds, than could short grass species with or without tussock
   forming. Our findings indicate that post-restoration management require
   carefully designed actions that are fine-tuned addressing specific
   threats at the site level. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The spread of the exotic shrub Scotch broom in the montane grasslands of
   the Nilgiris is one of the major threats to biodiversity and ecosystem
   function there. It is likely that fire suppression over the past few
   decades is the proximate cause of expansion of broom populations. This
   study capitalizes on a wildfire event to examine fire effects on mature
   broom populations and soil seedbanks. Fire resulted in widespread death
   of mature broom stands but also stimulated broom soil seedbanks.
   However, this initial difference in seedling densities in burned and
   unburned plots was lost over time due to continuous recruitment in
   unburned plots. In a seed addition experiment, plots which were clipped
   prior to the fire showed higher germination success, possibly because
   fire temperature was moderated by biomass removal. In another
   experiment, non-dormant broom seeds were added to burned plots, which
   then received clipping treatments; there were no differences in broom
   seedling survival in clipped vs. unclipped plots. Overall, these results
   suggest that prescribed burning might contribute to the control of
   Scotch broom invasion by helping eliminate mature stands without
   significantly increasing regeneration from seed. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In large areas of Central Europe, grassland management has shifted from
   extensive grazing and mowing to highly intensive systems during the past
   50 years. Although effects on biodiversity have intensively been
   studied, little is known about the response of important ecosystem
   functions, in particular, water and nutrient cycling, to management
   intensification. We conducted a two-factorial grassland management
   experiment (GRASSMAN) with two cutting frequencies (one/three cuttings
   per year) and two fertilization levels (non-fertilized/N-fertilized) in
   a moderately species-rich temperate grassland to analyse the effects of
   management regimes on evapotranspiration (ET) and infiltration (I). Both
   were measured in the growing season 2009 with small, weighable
   lysimeters that contained undisturbed soil monoliths and vegetation.
   Aboveground biomass production (ANPP), belowground biomass, root length
   density, plant diversity, water use efficiency (WUE), and climatic
   factors were also measured. Fertilization with 180 kg N ha-1yr-1
   increased aboveground biomass production by 50-70\% and stand ET by
   10-15\% (or 20-40 mm), whereas I and ground water recharge decreased by
   about 50\%. Consequently, fertilization increased the WUE of the
   grassland plants by 20-30\%. However, increasing the mowing frequency
   from 1 to 3 had no significant effect. We found close relations between
   ANPP, ET and I and conclude that grassland management intensification
   influences the water balance primarily through fertilization effects on
   productivity. In areas of Central Europe with abundant grassland, ground
   water recharge must have significantly decreased with management
   intensification in the past 50 years. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \&

Title = {{Nitrogen deposition enhances moss growth, but leads to an overall

Abstract = {{Ecosystems are subject to multiple, natural and anthropogenic
   environmental influences, including nitrogen (N) deposition, land use
   and climate. Assessment of the relative importance of these influences
   on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is crucial for guiding policy
   and management decisions to mitigate global change; yet, few studies
   consider multiple drivers. In the UK, ongoing loss of the
   internationally important arctic/alpine moss-sedge community,
   Racomitrium heath, has been linked to elevated N deposition, high
   grazing pressures and their combination; however, the relative
   importance of these drivers remains unclear. We used environmental
   gradients across the habitat's European distribution (UK, Faroes, Norway
   and Iceland) to investigate the relative impact of N deposition and
   grazing pressure, as well as climate, on the condition of the dominant
   moss species, Racomitrium lanuginosum. Key variables including tissue
   chemistry, growth and cover were measured at 36 sites, and multiple
   linear regressions were used to examine the relative importance of the
   drivers across sites. Our results clearly show that regional variation
   in the condition of R. lanuginosum across Europe is primarily associated
   with the impacts of N deposition, with climate (air temperature) and
   grazing pressure playing secondary roles. In contrast to previous
   experimental studies, we found moss growth to be stimulated by elevated
   N deposition; this apparent discrepancy may result from the use of
   artificially high N concentrations in many experiments. Despite
   increased growth rates, we found that moss mat depth and cover declined
   in response to N deposition. Our results suggest that this is due to
   increased decomposition of material in the moss mat, which ultimately
   leads to loss of moss cover and habitat degradation. This study clearly
   demonstrates both the key role of N deposition in degradation of
   Racomitrium heath and the importance of observational studies along
   natural gradients for testing predictions from experimental studies in
   the real world.}},

Abstract = {{Patch-burn grazing is a management framework designed to promote
   heterogeneity in grasslands, creating more diverse grassland structure
   to accommodate the habitat requirements of many grassland species,
   particularly grassland birds. Published studies on the effects of
   patch-burn grazing on passerines have been conducted on relatively large
   (430-980 ha pastures), contiguous grasslands, and only 1 of these
   studies has investigated the reproductive success of grassland birds. We
   assessed the effects of the patch-burn grazing and a more traditional
   treatment on the nesting ecology of grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus
   savannarum) in small (<37 ha pastures) grasslands located in southern
   Iowa from May to August of 2008 and 2009. The study pastures were grazed
   from May to September and prescribed burns were conducted in the spring.
   We investigated the effects of treatments on clutch size and modeled
   grasshopper sparrow nest survival as a function of multiple biological
   and ecological factors. We found no difference in clutch size between
   treatments; however, we did find a reduction in clutch size for nests
   that were parasitized by brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater).
   Constant daily survival rates were greater in patch-burn grazed pastures
   than in grazed-and-burned pastures (patch-burn grazed rate
   \$\{\textbackslash{}bar \{x\}\} = 0.930\$ and grazed-and-burned rate
   \$\{\textbackslash{}bar \{x\}\} = 0.907\$). Competitive survival models
   included year, stage of nest, nest age, and cool-season grass (csg)
   abundance within 5?m of the nest. Overall, csg abundance had the
   greatest effect on survival and had a negative influence. Although
   survival rates were highest in patch-burn grazed pastures, multiple
   factors influenced grasshopper sparrow survival. Nest survival rates for
   both treatments were relatively low, and variables other than treatment
   were more instrumental in predicting grasshopper sparrow survival. We
   recommend decreasing overall vegetation cover if increasing nesting
   habitat for grasshopper sparrows is a management goal. In addition, we
   recommend further investigation of heterogeneity management in
   fragmented landscapes to better understand how it affects biodiversity
   in relatively small management units that typify grassland habitats in
   the Midwest. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Seslerio uliginosae-Scorzoneretum purpureae is the only xerothermic
   community of the Festuco-Brometea class, where a rare species known as
   Sesleria uliginosa occurs in Poland. A couple of sites hosting this
   association in the Nida Basin were described in the 1920s and 1950s. All
   these stands are now situated in the areas designated as xerothermic
   nature reserves. The study aimed at describing the present-day
   characteristics of this rare association, the most likely being endemic
   in Poland, as well as the changes that have occurred in it. The species
   diversity and the contribution of xerothermic plants have decreased
   significantly in terms of their number and cover coefficient. Some of
   the diagnostic species of the association have become extremely rare.
   Sesleria uliginosa is the only one without visible changes in their
   dominant position in the community. Mosses, that have played a
   significant role before, were among the vanished species. At the same
   time, an increase in number and cover of mesophilous meadows species was
   observed. Mesophilous grasses belong to the group of species growing in
   significance in the phytocoenoses. The observed changes in species
   composition were reflected in a statistically significant increase of
   nitrogen indicator value. The slow process of succession observed in the
   Seslerio-Scorzoneretum purpureae could be attributed to the lack of
   appropriate land use, e.g. mowing and grazing that have been ceased in
   the nature reserves.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the relative effects of landscape
   scale management intensity, agroecosystem type, local management
   intensity and edges on diversity patterns of functional groups of
   plants, carabid beetles, spiders and grasshoppers. Nine landscapes were
   selected differing in percent intensively used agricultural area (IAA),
   each with a pair of organic and conventional winter wheat fields and a
   pair of organic and conventional mown meadows. Within fields, plants
   were surveyed in the edge and in the interior. Carabid beetles and
   spiders were captured by funnel traps, while grasshoppers were
   sweep-netted in the meadows. Diversity patterns of study organisms were
   affected both by local variables (local management. agroecosystem type
   and within-field position) and by landscape scale management intensity.
   Species richness of grasses, presumably because of sowing low-diversity
   mixtures, and hunting spiders decreased with percent cover of IAA.
   Meadows differed from wheat fields in that they had higher species
   richness of forbs and grasses, as well as higher densities of hunting
   spiders. In contrast, more carabid individuals, especially of
   non-carnivore species, were captured in wheat fields. In field edges
   with their reduced management intensity and increased immigration,
   species richness of plants, carabids and spiders was higher than in the
   interiors regardless of agroecosystem type and management. Organic
   management enhanced forb richness and cover in both agroecosystem types.
   Organic management also increased grass cover in wheat fields, but not
   in meadows, and promoted species richness of non-carnivore carabids and
   hunting spiders, but not grasshoppers. The results show that
   agri-environmental management needs to be targeted to the
   agroecosystem's field size, because higher edge area led to higher
   species richness. Organic management affected several functional groups
   positively (forbs, non-carnivore carabids, hunting spiders), while lower
   landscape scale management intensity only increased species richness of
   grasses and spiders. The great differences in responses of functional
   groups to local cereal and grassland as well as landscape management
   suggest implementing more scale and group specific targets for
   agri-environmental schemes to improve their efficiency. (C) 2011

Pages = {{197-209}},
Abstract = {{Two decades of biodiversity-ecosystem functioning research have not yet
   led to consensus view on how local dominance and biodiversity affect the
   stability of ecosystems in the presence of disturbances. As natural
   systems are usually affected by multiple stressors, we tested the
   diversity-stability hypothesis on phytoplankton communities subjected to
   combinations of 2 stressors (pH reduction and simulated grazing).
   Monocultures revealed uncorrelated species' sensitivities to the 2
   stressors and the presence of a best-performing species (Scenedesmus
   obliquus). We thus selected 2 experimental species combinations, either
   (A) including or (B) excluding S. obliquus, and inoculated at 3
   diversity levels (2, 4, 8 species). Both stressors induced significant
   biovolume loss and increased temporal biovolume variation, but the
   effect on final biomass (B-tot) differed between combinations and with
   richness. The fast recovery of S. obliquus precluded long-term
   disturbance effects on B-tot in Combination A. Correspondingly, these
   communities showed slower recovery rates and lower B-tot with more
   species present, since the strong performance of S. obliquus was diluted
   by more species being present. More species-rich assemblages in
   Combination B lost more biovolume after stressor application, whereas
   the recovery rates showed a more complex pattern, depending on stressor
   sequence and species richness. Our study suggests that the stability of
   communities in the face of multiple disturbances cannot be predicted
   from a general diversity-stability relationship alone, but depends on
   the correlation between species sensitivities to different stressors and
   on the population dynamics of a well-performing species when dominant.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{205-213}},
Abstract = {{We studied species richness, composition and coverage of the bryophyte
   layer in young deciduous forest plantations on abandoned agricultural
   lands in relation to overstory tree species (hybrid aspen or silver
   birch), land use history (crop field or grassland), site preparation
   method (whole-area ploughing or strip tillage), and soil properties
   (moisture, pH, concentrations of N, P and K). The aim of these
   plantations is to produce pulpwood and energy-wood under the principles
   of short-rotation forestry. The area under forest plantations is
   increasing in the region; however their impact on biodiversity is still
   scantily studied. Previous studies on understory vegetation have focused
   more often on vascular plants and less frequently on bryophytes. For
   this experiment, a total of 248 vegetation plots (2 m x 2 m) were
   established within 62 long-term experimental plots (size 0.1 ha). Thirty
   eight bryophyte species were found in total, with an average of 1.86 +/-
   0.11 species per vegetation plot and 4.02 +/- 0.26 per experimental
   plot. The mean coverage of the bryophyte layer was 11.54 +/- 2.14\%. As
   expected, typical bryophytes were light-demanding perennials. According
   to substrate preference the majority of species were either epigeic or
   generalist. Positive correlation was observed between soil pH and
   coverage of the bryophyte layer. The impact of land use history and site
   preparation method on species composition was still evident, since the
   number of short-living bryophytes was higher in former fields and
   whole-area ploughed sites. Bryophyte species richness was not affected
   by overstory tree species in young plantations. Obviously during the
   further management of plantations the emergence of new substrata e.g.
   stem bark of bigger trees, leaning stems, branch litter and cutting
   residues should add diversity to the bryophyte vegetation.}},

Title = {{A quantitative index of land-use intensity in grasslands: Integrating
   mowing, grazing and fertilization}},
Journal = {{BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{207-220}},
Abstract = {{Land use is increasingly recognized as a major driver of biodiversity
   and ecosystem functioning in many current research projects. In
   grasslands, land use is often classified by categorical descriptors such
   as pastures versus meadows or fertilized versus unfertilized sites.
   However, to account for the quantitative variation of multiple land-use
   types in heterogeneous landscapes, a quantitative, continuous index of
   land-use intensity (LUI) is desirable. Here we define such a compound,
   additive LUI index for managed grasslands including meadows and
   pastures. The LUI index summarizes the standardized intensity of three
   components of land use, namely fertilization, mowing, and livestock
   grazing at each site. We examined the performance of the LUI index to
   predict selected response variables on up to 150 grassland sites in the
   Biodiversity Exploratories in three regions in Germany(Alb, Hainich,
   Schorlheide). We tested the average Ellenberg nitrogen indicator values
   of the plant community, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in the
   aboveground plant biomass, plant-available phosphorus concentration in
   the top soil, and soil C/N ratio, and the first principle component of
   these five response variables.
   The LUI index significantly predicted the principal component of all
   five response variables, as well as some of the individual responses.
   Moreover, vascular plant diversity decreased significantly with LUI in
   two regions (Alb and Hainich).
   Inter-annual changes in management practice were pronounced from 2006 to
   2008, particularly due to variation in grazing intensity. This rendered
   the selection of the appropriate reference year(s) an important decision
   for analyses of land-use effects, whereas details in the standardization
   of the index were of minor importance. We also tested several
   alternative calculations of a LUI index, but all are strongly linearly
   correlated to the proposed index.
   The proposed LUI index reduces the complexity of agricultural practices
   to a single dimension and may serve as a baseline to test how different
   groups of organisms and processes respond to land use. In combination
   with more detailed analyses, this index may help to unravel whether and
   how land-use intensities, associated disturbance levels or other local
   or regional influences drive ecological processes.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Biological invasions facilitate ecosystem transformation by altering
   the structure and function, diversity, dominance and disturbance
   regimes. A classic case is the grassfire cycle in which grass invasion
   increases the frequency, scale and/or intensity of wildfires and
   promotes the continued invasion of invasive grasses. Despite wide
   acceptance of the grassfire cycle, questions linger about the relative
   roles that interspecific plant competition and fire play in ecosystem
   transformations.
   Location Sonoran Desert Arizona Upland of the Santa Catalina Mountains,
   Arizona, USA.
   Methods We measured species cover, density and saguaro (Carnegiea
   gigantea) size structure along gradients of Pennisetum ciliare invasion
   at 10 unburned/ungrazed P. ciliare patches. Regression models quantified
   differences in diversity, cover and density with respect to P. ciliare
   cover, and residence time and a Fisher's exact test detected demographic
   changes in saguaro populations. Because P. ciliare may have initially
   invaded locations that were both more invasible and less diverse, we ran
   analyses with and without the plots in which initial infestations were
   located.
   Results Richness and diversity decreased with P. ciliare cover as did
   cover and density of most dominant species. Richness and diversity
   declined with increasing time since invasion, suggesting an ongoing
   transformation. The proportion of old-to-young Carnegiea gigantea was
   significantly lower in plots with dominant P. ciliare cover.
   Main conclusions Rich desert scrub (15-25 species per plot) was
   transformed into depauperate grassland (2-5 species per plot) within 20
   years following P. ciliare invasion without changes to the fire regime.
   While the onset of a grass-fire cycle may drive ecosystem change in the
   later stages and larger scales of grass invasions of arid lands,
   competition by P. ciliare can drive small-scale transformations earlier
   in the invasion. Linking competition-induced transformation rates with
   spatially explicit models of spread may be necessary for predicting
   landscape-level impacts on ecosystem processes in advance of a
   grass-fire cycle.}},

   change depend on land use and region}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{18}},

Abstract = {{Macroclimatic niche properties derived from species distribution ranges
   are fundamental for projections of climate change impacts on
   biodiversity. However, it has been recognized that changes in regional
   or local distribution patterns also depend on interactions with land
   use. The reliability and transferability of large scale geographic
   predictions to small scale plant performance need to be tested
   experimentally. Thus, we asked how grassland plant species pairs with
   different macroclimatic niche properties respond to increased spring
   temperature and decrease summer precipitation in three different
   land-use types. An experiment was carried out in the framework of the
   German Biodiversity Exploratories simulating climate change in 45
   experimental plots in three geographical regions (Schorfheide-Chorin,
   Hainich-Dun, Schwabische Alb) and three grassland management types
   (meadow, pasture, mown pasture). We planted six plant species as
   phytometers, each two of them representing congeneric species with
   contrasting macroclimatic niches and recorded plant survival and growth
   over 1 year. To quantify the species macroclimatic niches with respect
   to drought tolerance, the species distribution ranges were mapped and
   combined with global climate data. The simulated climate change had a
   general negative effect on plant survival and plant growth, irrespective
   of the macroclimatic niche characteristics of the species. Against
   expectation, species with ranges extending into drier regions did not
   generally perform better under drier conditions. Growth performance and
   survival was best in mown pastures, representing a quite intensive type
   of land use in all study regions. Species with higher macroclimatic
   drought tolerance were generally characterized by lower growth rates and
   higher survival rates in land-use types with regular mowing regimes,
   probably because of reduced competition in the growing season. In
   conclusion, plant species with similar climatic niche characteristics
   cannot be expected to respond consistently over different regions owing
   to complex interactions of climate change with land use practices.}},

Title = {{Low-intensity grazing with domestic herbivores: A tool for maintaining
   and restoring plant diversity in temperate Europe}},
Journal = {{TUEXENIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Number = {{32}},
Pages = {{167-205}},
Abstract = {{The continuous decline in biodiversity in some European landscapes has
   led recently to the (re-) implementation of low-intensity grazing
   systems as an alternative to more cost-intensive conservation practices.
   This approach aims at developing habitat complexes comprising various
   successional stages and increasing plant species diversity on local
   (a-diversity) and landscape scales (beta-, gamma-diversity). The primary
   objectives of this review were to uncover ecological processes in which
   large domestic herbivores (cattle, equids, sheep, goats, pigs) have a
   key function in affecting plant diversity and to provide a framework for
   future research and conservation practices. The reviewed literature
   covers a wide range of ecosystem types in various temperate regions of
   Europe with a main focus on recent results from Central Europe.
   Low-intensity grazing enhances existing environmental gradients and
   generates manifold disturbance patterns on various spatial scales
   resulting in high habitat diversity. Livestock trampling has a so far
   underestimated impact on plant species composition and richness.
   Additionally, selective herbivore behavior facilitates the coexistence
   of plant species representing different functional types including a
   considerable number of threatened and grazing-sensitive species.
   Co-occurrence of progressive and regressive successional processes on
   low-intensive pastures results in a high beta- and gamma-diversity, an
   effect that has been observed soon after the (re-)implementation of
   grazing. Persistence of species-poor successional stages of dominant
   competitive graminoid and herb species can in many cases be inhibited by
   grazing. Large domestic herbivores serve as effective vectors for the
   dispersal of diaspores, thus improving the connectivity of isolated
   plant populations. There is a combined effect of diaspore dispersal and
   microsite creation which can increase the probability of diaspores to
   successfully germinate and establish. Overall, low-intensity grazing
   represents a highly flexible concept to maintain and restore plant
   diversity in cultivated landscapes; general management implications are
   given.}},

   Defence in Plantago lanceolata}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Background: Forecasting the consequences of accelerating rates of
   changes in biodiversity for ecosystem functioning requires a mechanistic
   understanding of the relationships between the structure of biological
   communities and variation in plant functional characteristics. So far,
   experimental data of how plant species diversity influences the
   investment of individual plants in direct chemical defences against
   herbivores and pathogens is lacking.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: We used Plantago lanceolata as a model
   species in experimental grasslands differing in species richness and
   composition (Jena Experiment) to investigate foliar concentrations of
   the iridoid glycosides (IG), catalpol and its biosynthetic precursor
   aucubin. Total IG and aucubin concentrations decreased, while catalpol
   concentrations increased with increasing plant diversity in terms of
   species or functional group richness. Negative plant diversity effects
   on total IG and aucubin concentrations correlated with increasing
   specific leaf area of P. lanceolata, suggesting that greater allocation
   to light acquisition reduced the investment into these carbon-based
   defence components. In contrast, increasing leaf nitrogen concentrations
   best explained increasing concentrations of the biosynthetically more
   advanced IG, catalpol. Observed levels of leaf damage explained a
   significant proportion of variation in total IG and aucubin
   concentrations, but did not account for variance in catalpol
   concentrations.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our results clearly show that plants growing
   in communities of varying species richness and composition differ in
   their defensive chemistry, which may modulate plant susceptibility to
   enemy attack and consequently their interactions with higher trophic
   level organisms.}},

Abstract = {{Montane grassy habitats in the Western Carpathians are relatively well
   preserved, maintain high species richness and are often important in
   accordance to the nature conservation policy in Europe. However,
   knowledge about the impact of farming on the habitat quality there is
   rather poor. The influence of various management types (permanent sheep
   pen, irregular grazing, mowing) on Orthoptera diversity and species
   determining assemblages of these habitats were analysed on 72 plots in
   Polana Mts Biosphere Reserve. Altogether, 36 Orthoptera species (15
   Ensifera, 21 Caelifera) were found, whereas the highest number of
   species was found on plots with irregular grazing (28 species), followed
   by plots with mown grass (17) and permanent sheep pens (14). All four
   measures of the assemblages' diversity confirmed significant
   differences. Using Discriminant Function Analysis, correct
   classification rate of Orthoptera assemblages was unambiguous according
   to the type of management. Each form of the management harboured several
   characteristic species. Thus implications regarding the biodiversity
   conservation and grassland management were given.}},

Title = {{Local land use effects and regional environmental limits on earthworm

Abstract = {{In many arable soils, earthworms form the key component of the soil
   animal community and greatly contribute to soil quality. Our goal was to
   identify variables that can explain the variation of earthworm
   communities across Finnish arable fields by focusing on both regional
   aspects, such as climate and inherent soil properties, and local
   aspects, such as field management practices and field margins. We
   sampled the earthworms during the autumn of 2004 and 2005 at 53 sites of
   cultivated fields and margins, distributed to 11 localities ranging from
   the southern parts of Finland to the Arctic Circle. Simultaneously,
   information was collected on topsoil properties, cultivation history,
   and climatic factors. We found that soil type was by far the best
   regional variable to explain the variation in total earthworm density,
   the density being highest in medium coarse soils, i.e., silts and very
   fine sands. However, soil type had a significant interaction with soil
   C:N ratio. After accounting for the effect of soil type, no clear
   geographical trends remained in the regional variation, except that
   coastal areas with thin snow cover and deep frost had lower earthworm
   density than inland areas with deep snow cover and shallow frost. Of the
   local variables, tillage frequency, grazing, and field margins were the
   most influential. Frequent tillage led to earthworm communities heavily
   dominated by endogeic species, while grazed pastures had more than three
   times the earthworm biomass in comparison to non-grazed fields. Field
   margins harbored over twice the density and almost double the number of
   species in comparison to the adjacent cultivated fields, and eight of
   the nine species had wider regional distribution in the margins than in
   the fields. Inside the fields, species richness tended to decrease
   gradually with increasing distance to the margin. Our results suggest
   that, while soil texture and climatic factors set the general limits to
   earthworm communities in Finnish arable soils, field management
   practices can override these limits at the local scale. Cultivation in
   general simplifies the earthworm community, and this is particularly
   clear in the fields that are frequently tilled, whereas pastures and
   field margins seem to effectively preserve the biomass and diversity of
   earthworms.}},

Abstract = {{Oligotrophic mountain meadows are threatened biodiversity hotspots
   throughout Europe. The traditional summer hay-making followed by autumn
   grazing is no longer economic and question is whether alternative
   managements can maintain both plant species and functional diversity
   typical of these habitats. In the Bohemian Forest Mts., we applied three
   treatments (mowing once a year - i.e., cutting and removing the biomass,
   mulching once a year - cutting and leaving the crushed biomass to
   decompose in situ, fallowing - no cutting) in order to assess temporal
   changes in meadow vegetation, plant trait composition and biomass
   production in a 13-year experiment. We recorded for each species
   twenty-five traits as to be most informative of plant strategies related
   to growth, resource acquisition and carbon-water economy. We compared
   different components of trait composition (community averages that
   mostly reflect traits of dominant species vs. the Rao index of
   functional diversity that reflects trait dissimilarity among species)
   and their impact on biomass production. We show that mulching promotes
   species and functional diversity by facilitating heliophilous forbs and
   legumes with more acquisitive strategies in resource use and release,
   e.g., higher foliar N and P content. This occurs at the expense of tall
   grasses (with resource-retentive strategies, e.g., high leaf dry matter
   content) which dominate the mown and fallow plots. The divergence in
   most quantitative traits indicates that niche complementarity is the
   dominant assembly process in mulched plots, which can prevent
   competitive exclusion and enable species coexistence. The divergent
   development was detected only after 5-6 years. This slow floristic and
   functional response is caused by acidity of soil and severe mountain
   climate that preclude rapid responses of vegetation to land-use changes.
   We conclude that mulching represents a good compromise maintaining both
   plant species and functional diversity as well as a relatively high
   biomass production. Mowing without grazing leads to gradual nutrient
   loss and thus reduces the productivity and diversity in these
   oligotrophic ecosystems. Fallowing causes gradual loss in diversity by
   increased grass competition and litter accumulation. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{It is the aim of plant functional research to generate general rules of
   species assembly and species reactions based on plant functional traits.
   Here we determined plant functional groups that are important with
   regard to land use types (grazing, mowing, mulching, burning,
   abandonment) and looked for mechanisms leading to changes in species
   composition after management changes in calcareous grasslands.
   To filter out the set of traits which best described the variation in
   plant composition along the studied land use gradient and to identify
   functional groups we chose an iterative three-table ordination method.
   We included traits related to persistence as well as traits describing
   the germination niche of a plant. To gain insight into underlying
   mechanisms which led to differing importance of these plant functional
   groups at different management regimes we investigated shifts in
   dominance of the identified functional groups at eight management
   regimes using long-term vegetation data of a site which was grazed
   before the onset of different management regimes in 1974. Ongoing
   unidirectional changes in cover of the four determined functional groups
   at most of the treatments indicated that even after almost 30 years new
   equilibria of functional group composition were still not reached.
   The study showed that other management treatments but grazing and mowing
   led to changes in functional group composition, which were mainly driven
   by increasing dominance of a highly competitive species group. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to determine the effects of different
   long-term management options on re-establishment of traditional
   species-rich grassland in a Lolio-Cynosuretum grassland. The experiment
   was set up in 1987 in a low-fertilized mown pasture in the Eifel
   Mountains (Germany). Two and four cuts per year each with three levels
   of nitrogen fertilizer application were compared to no application of P
   and K fertilizer. Biomass production increased as a result of N
   application, whereas crude protein content and digestibility of organic
   matter improved in the four-cut treatments. During a 20-year period, we
   found a significant shift in dominant grass species without any
   significant effect on species richness. Lolium perenne and Elytrigia
   repens were replaced by Holcus lanatus and Alopecurus pratensis,
   especially in the two-cut treatments with N application. In the
   unfertilized plots, several individuals of Platanthera bifolia appeared
   when swards were cut only twice per year, probably as a result of
   nutrient depletion together with low cutting frequency. An increase in
   number of cuts mainly supported plant species well adapted to intensive
   management, even under low N application and relatively low
   plant-available P content in the soil. Therefore, we conclude that
   cutting frequency was a key driver on plant species composition in this
   experiment. The re-establishment of traditional species-rich grassland
   from intensively managed Lolio-Cynosuretum was not achieved within 20
   years of cutting management combined with absence of P and K
   application.}},

Pages = {{204-210}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Facilitation can occur when one species changes form to function as a
   nurse plant. Miscanthus sinensis grasslands are one component of the
   typical Satoyama landscape. Due to dieback, the shoot density of M.
   sinensis decreases with increasing patch size, forming fairy rings and
   subsequently facilitating the establishment of co-existing plants by
   improving soil and light conditions. M. sinensis forms fairy rings also
   with human management efforts, particularly burning or cutting. In this
   study, it was hypothesized that M. sinensis fairy rings created by human
   management function as a nursery for other species in Sengokuhara
   grasslands maintained by burning or cutting. To test this hypothesis,
   the plant species richness inside and outside M. sinensis fairy-ring
   patches was compared after management events. Species richness was
   higher inside M. sinensis patches than outside the patches. The type of
   management method also affected plant species richness. Total number of
   species and the number of woody plant species were significantly lower
   in the burned areas than in the cut areas, whereas the reverse was
   observed for the number of spring ephemeral species. These differences
   may have been caused by micro-environmental differences generated by
   management methods and by plant life forms. The results indicate that
   management-induced facilitation may play an important role in conserving
   plant species diversity in Satoyama grasslands.}},

Abstract = {{Sikkim is a small, mountainous, Indian state (7,096 km(2)) located in
   the eastern Himalayan region. Though a global biodiversity hotspot, it
   has been relatively less studied. A detailed forest type, density and
   change dynamics study was undertaken, using SATELLITE remote sensing
   data and intensive field verification. The landscape was found to be
   dominated by alpine and nival ecosystems, with a large portion above the
   tree line, considerable snow cover, and a sizeable area under forest
   cover (72\%, 5,094 km(2)). A total of 18 landscape components including
   14 vegetation classes were delineated, with the major ones being oak
   forest, alpine meadow, alpine scrub, conifer forest and alder-cardamom
   agro-forestry. Of the 3,154 km(2) of forests below the tree line, 40\%
   were found to be dense (> 40\% tree canopy cover). A sizeable portion of
   the non dense forests below the tree line was contributed by the
   degradation of oak forests, which was confirmed by change detection
   analysis. However on a positive front over the past decade, ban on
   grazing and felling of trees in forests has been implemented. In order
   to expand the extent of dense forests, further efforts are needed for
   the restoration of oak forests such as fire protection, providing
   alternatives to firewood use, promotion of alder-cardamom agro-forestry
   in the private lands and protection of the small-sized, fragmented
   forest patches in the subtropical belt.}},

Abstract = {{Co-extinction is a recurring topic in conservation biology.
   Quantification of co-extinction has been generally restricted to
   parasite-host, predator-prey and herbivore-host plant interactions. The
   loss of detritivorous insects upon the depletion of herbivore mammals
   has been poorly explored. Here, we used rarefaction curves to predict
   co-decline involving the decrease in scarab dung beetles diversity due
   to a reduction in the number of dens of the Asia minor ground squirrel
   in the Turkish steppe biome. We also evaluated the potential benefits
   provided by livestock in mitigating the decline of scarab beetle
   communities. Rarefaction curves estimated that a 50\% reduction in the
   number of sample units where squirrel faecal pellets are the only
   available food resource accounts for a reduction of 28\% of all the
   scarab species, and of 24\% of the squirrel-linked species. The current
   decline of ground squirrels, mainly due to intensification of
   agriculture, may represent a threat for biodiversity in steppic
   environments because it may affect the specialized insects, and may
   produce a cascade effect also on their predators, i.e., saker falcon,
   buzzards, eagles and mustelids. We also showed that the conservation of
   ground squirrels and their affiliate scarab species may be ensured by a
   moderate livestock grazing, owing to the higher ecological success of
   these rodents in the presence of large herbivores keeping low the grass
   cover.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we summarize for the first time the effects of agriculture
   expansion and intensification on animal diversity in the Pampas of
   Argentina and discuss research needs for biodiversity conservation in
   the area. The Pampas experienced little human intervention until the
   last decades of the 19th century. Agriculture expanded quickly during
   the 20th century, transforming grasslands into cropland and pasture
   lands and converting the landscape into a mosaic of natural fragments,
   agricultural fields, and linear habitats. In the 1980s, agriculture
   intensification and replacement of cattle grazing-cropping systems by
   continuous cropping promoted a renewed homogenisation of the most
   productive areas. Birds and carnivores were more strongly affected than
   rodents and insects, but responses varied within groups: (a) the
   geographic ranges and/or abundances of many native species were reduced,
   including those of carnivores, herbivores, and specialist species
   (grassland-adapted birds and rodents, and probably specialized
   pollinators), sometimes leading to regional extinction (birds and large
   carnivores), (b) other native species were unaffected (birds) or
   benefited (bird, rodent and possibly generalist pollinator and
   crop-associated insect species), (c) novel species were introduced, thus
   increasing species richness of most groups (26\% of non-rodent mammals,
   11.1\% of rodents, 6.2\% of birds, 0.8\% of pollinators). Much taxonomic
   and ecological work is still needed to understand Pampean animal
   biodiversity, to understand how agriculturization is affecting it, and
   to identify appropriate conservation actions. Networks of Important Bird
   Areas and Valuable Grassland Areas harbor a balanced representation of
   Pampean biodiversity and, if adequately protected, may provide valuable
   research sites, but complementary work should be carried out on
   agriculturized areas.}},

Abstract = {{Plant diversity has been reported to increase productivity. Farming
   practices aiming at conserving or increasing plant diversity are,
   however, usually less profitable than conventional ones. In this review,
   we aim to find reasons for this discrepancy, discuss ecosystem services
   of grassland phytodiversity that are useful for farmers, and ways of
   livestock management most beneficial for diversity. Under agricultural
   conditions, a clear effect of species richness on a site's primary or
   secondary production has not yet been demonstrated. Reasons could be
   that species numbers in permanent grassland are above the threshold of
   five species found effective in experimental plots or that the
   conditions are more in equilibrium with management than in weeded
   experimental plots. Other diversity effects on production stability,
   nutrient and water retention or product quality might convince farmers
   to increase diversity. However, these should be tested in agricultural
   situations, as most research has again been carried out in experimental
   plots. To enhance phytodiversity, grazing has been found superior over
   mowing, as selective grazing, treading and excreta deposition increase
   the heterogeneity of a sward and thus the niches available. Especially
   rotational grazing with intermediate intensity may be advantageous for
   phytodiversity. However, complex interactions between environmental
   conditions, sward composition, management and livestock behaviour make
   it difficult to forecast grazing effects. Thus, ecological and
   agricultural researchers should cooperate more, e.g. either in
   interdisciplinary projects or by hiring researchers from the respective
   other profession and thus diversifying research groups, in order to
   integrate agricultural management into biodiversity research and
   biodiversity measurements into agricultural research to advance our
   understanding of how to make conservation and enhancement of grassland
   phytodiversity both feasible and sustainable.}},

Abstract = {{Restored grasslands and shrublands are integral parts of the
   semi-natural landscape and are of major importance for biodiversity in
   the northern Loess Plateau. Determining the underlying factors that
   control the richness and composition of herbaceous species in restored
   grasslands and shrublands is urgently needed. Thus, the specific
   objective of this study was to evaluate the relative importance of soil,
   plant, and topographic explanatory variables affecting the richness and
   composition of herbaceous species in restored shrubland and grassland
   ecosystems in a typical watershed within the northern Loess Plateau. In
   this study, 27 restored grassland sites and 16 restored shrubland sites
   were sampled during September 2009. Using variation partitioning
   (partial canonical correspondence analysis), we determined the
   individual and shared effects of these three sets of explanatory
   variables on herbaceous biodiversity in the two restored habitats. Most
   of the explained variation in plant diversity was related to the pure
   effect of soil, plant, and topographic variables. Restored shrublands
   had significantly more species than grasslands, and abandoned dam
   farmlands had significantly more species than other grassland sites.
   Moreover, botanical diversity responded differently to the explanatory
   variables in different plant communities. The pure effects of soil
   properties, soil moisture in particular, accounted for the largest
   fractions of explained variation in species diversity in restored
   grasslands. Both plant and topographic variables had balancing pure
   effects on species diversity in restored shrublands, in particular the
   shrub density and slope angle. We conclude that the maintenance of a
   moderate density of shrubs (less than 3600 shrubs per ha), construction
   of check-dams, and grazing at a low stocking rate, taking conditions of
   soil and topographic site into account, may help to conserve
   biodiversity in the northern Loess Plateau.}},

Abstract = {{The woodlands of temperate south-eastern Australia are characterised by
   extensive historical clearing and ongoing modification of the
   understorey habitat through livestock grazing, fertilization and
   cropping. The reptile assemblage of these temperate woodlands, while
   relatively speciose, is believed to be in decline. We report on the
   abundance and diversity of terrestrial reptiles in native pastures in
   south-eastern Australia in relation to landscape and local factors; in
   particular, latitude and grazing management and tree retention. Reptiles
   were sampled on 24 paired farms spread widely over the south-western
   slopes of south-eastern Australia. Each pair comprised one farm under
   rotational grazing and a neighbouring farm with continuous grazing.
   Twenty-one species were detected, dominated numerically by several
   skinks and a pygopodid, with clear disparities in the biogeographic
   distribution of reptiles and also variation owing to survey technique,
   location, grazing regime, and the presence of trees. Multivariate models
   showed that the distribution of reptiles is influenced by factors
   operating at several levels and, to a lesser extent, by farm management.
   Reptile occurrence was regularly explained by correlations with
   site-level structural heterogeneity (e.g. native plant richness, number
   of large trees and log cover) as well as showing strong underlying
   latitudinal variation. The presence of woodland is critical to reptile
   occurrence in grazed (and fragmented) landscapes. If the reptile
   assemblage of this agroecosystem is to benefit from altered farm
   management, then different management and policy responses may be
   required, depending on the levels of habitat structural complexity and
   agricultural intensification that already exist. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Buffer zones in arable land could promote biodiversity of agricultural
   areas. These are most often established with sown seed mixtures of
   grasses and herb species. We studied the impact of cutting management
   and the role of the seedbank on plant species diversity of a sown buffer
   strip. Two main hypotheses H(1) were tested in this study: (i) sward
   cutting and removal have positive effects on plant species diversity in
   a buffer zone adjacent to a cultivated field and (ii) the buffer zone
   soil seedbank and adjacent grassland act as a species source for the
   managed buffer zone. After 5 years of management, the number of species
   was significantly higher and the litter coverage significantly lower in
   plots mown yearly with cuttings removed than in mown plots with the
   cuttings left or an uncut control. The abundance of Elymus repens was
   not affected by the cutting management. To reduce E. repens probably
   needs cutting more frequently than once per year. Cutting management did
   not reduce easily-soluble phosphorus in soils. For species colonisation,
   adjacent grassland played a more important role than the soil seedbank.
   We conclude that, in this study, the reduced litter cover, together with
   adjacent sources of species, resulted in the gradual increase in species
   diversity in the species-poor buffer habitat. This study took place in a
   single location and similar studies in additional locations would be
   helpful in assessing the generality of our results. On the evidence of
   this study, the contract periods of agri-environmental schemes should be
   longer than 5 years to ensure cutting does result in positive benefits
   for the management of biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Remaining patches of semi-natural grasslands are hot spots for
   biodiversity in modern agricultural landscapes. In Sweden semi-natural
   pastures cover approximately 500,000 ha. However, power-line corridors,
   road verges and clear-cuts cover larger areas (in total about 2,000,000
   ha), and these open, less intensively managed habitats are potentially
   important for species associated with taller vegetation and flower
   resources (e.g. pollinating insects). The aim of the present study was
   to evaluate the relative importance of semi-natural pastures and the
   other three open habitats for butterflies in 12 forest-farmland mosaic
   landscapes in south central Sweden. Species composition differed
   significantly between habitats in multivariate analyses. Power-line
   corridors and semi-natural pastures harbored several species that were
   disproportionally abundant in these habitats (13 and 8 species,
   respectively), and power-line corridors also harbored several species
   that were classified as typical in indicator species analyses. There
   were more butterfly species, higher abundances and a tendency for more
   individuals of red-listed species in power-line corridors than in the
   other three habitats. Effects of the surrounding landscape composition
   seemed to be weaker than that of the local habitat. However, species
   composition was significantly associated with landscape composition and
   species with intermediate and low mobility were more abundant in
   forested landscapes than in landscapes dominated by arable fields.
   Analyses of flying time and host plants for larvae suggest that early
   flying species and species associated with dwarf shrubs were more common
   in power-line corridors than in the other habitats. A landscape
   perspective, which takes several habitats into account, is needed for
   conservation of butterfly communities in forest-farmland landscapes.
   Power-line corridors and road verges offer possibilities for creating
   habitats that are suitable for pollinating insects through
   conservation-oriented management. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The importance of invertebrate herbivores in regulating plant
   communities remains unclear, due to the absence of long-term exclusion
   experiments. An experiment in an English grassland involving long-term
   exclusions of insect and mollusc herbivores, along with rabbit fencing,
   showed strong, but opposing, effects of the invertebrate herbivores.
   Plant species richness declined and biomass increased following insect
   exclusion, due to increased dominance by a grass species, whereas
   mollusc exclusion led to increased herbs abundance. The two herbivores
   had a compensatory interaction: molluscs had no effects in the absence
   of insects and large insect effects depended on the absence of molluscs.
   The effects of invertebrate exclusion became apparent only after 8
   years, and would have been seriously underestimated in shorter studies.
   Our results suggest that theorists and conservation managers need to
   shift from their historic focus on vertebrate herbivory, to a
   recognition that invertebrates can be equally important drivers of plant
   community structure.}},

Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2011}},

Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Many species of plants and animals associated with grasslands are rare
   or declining due to habitat loss and degradation. Although grassland
   plants and insects evolved in the context of both grazing and fire, the
   appropriate use of grazing and fire has been debated among those
   concerned with protecting insect communities. We established an
   experiment to test insect responses to three grassland management
   treatments: (1) patch-burn graze (burning of spatially distinct patches
   and free access by cattle), (2) graze-and-burn (burning of entire tract
   with free access by cattle), and (3) burn-only. Because we expected that
   land-use legacies could also affect insect abundance and diversity, we
   evaluated effects of time since fire, grazing history, remnant history
   (remnant or reconstructed grassland) and pre-treatment vegetation
   characteristics, which were assumed to be a legacy of prior land-use.
   Butterflies (Lepidoptera), ants (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and leaf
   beetles (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) were surveyed for three years to
   compare their responses to each of these treatments as measured by
   abundance, richness and species diversity. Each of these taxa is
   relatively diverse and was expected to have the potential to have strong
   negative responses to grazing and burning, but we predicted more
   positive responses to patch-burn grazing. Our results showed that
   land-use legacies affected insect abundance, richness and diversity, but
   treatments did not. Ant abundance was lower in tracts with a history of
   heavy grazing. Ant species richness was positively associated with
   pre-treatment time since fire and vegetation height and negatively
   associated with pre-treatment proportion native plant cover. Butterfly
   abundance was positively associated with pre-treatment litter cover.
   Leaf beetle diversity was positively associated with pre-treatment
   native plant cover, and leaf beetle abundance was negatively associated
   with time since fire. Our results indicate that land-use legacies can
   exert more influence on grassland insect community composition than
   current management, but the particular aspects of these land-use
   legacies that are important vary across insect taxa. The implications of
   these finding are that (1) land-use legacies should garner more
   attention in grassland management and (2) conservation of grassland
   insect communities will be improved by taxon-specific analysis of
   land-use legacy variables.}},

   This study, based on a characterization of agricultural practices and

   characterize vegetation based on a functional approach. This work should
   help improve forecasting models for vegetation.; dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{In this review we compile results on interactions above and below ground
   and food web functioning in an arid environment at the Baza Basin, in
   the Iberian southeast. Our data reveal that herbivory is difficult to
   estimate in our system. Some herbivores (rabbits) and granivores (Messor
   ants) create nutrient and detritus-rich patches, with important effects
   on the diversity and abundance of species both above and below ground.
   Fluctuations of prey availability, especially those caused by changes in
   their circadian rhythms, provoke seasonal migrations and omnivory in
   predators. We also present experimental evidence of the effects of
   interactions between aboveground and belowground macroarthropods on
   litter degradation: belowground detritivores are responsible for a high
   percentage of ground surface litter decomposition. We demonstrate that
   belowground herbivores and decomposers can dramatically change
   aboveground multitrophic interactions. Finally, we identify the biotic
   and abiotic factors controlling aboveground and belowground macrofaunal
   distribution at a broad scale. We conclude that trophic interactions in
   this semi-arid area are numerous and complex with many of the
   interactions involving more than two or three organisms. The
   interactions between above- and belowground organisms added complexity
   to this system. These habitats in which organisms deal with extreme
   abiotic conditions promote odd interactions resulting in an increase of
   biodiversity. Finally, despite the large research effort devoted to
   understanding food web structure and dynamics in this area recently, our
   state of knowledge is still far from providing a complete picture of
   interactions and their implications in the regulation and functioning of
   the system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Plant species richness responses to grazing protection and degradation
   history in a low productivity landscape}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{997-1008}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Questions: Does species richness and abundance accumulate with grazing
   protection in low productivity ecosystems with a short evolutionary
   history of grazing, as predicted by emerging theory? How do responses to
   grazing protection inform degradation history?
   Location: Mulga (Acacia aneura) dry forest, eastern Australia, generally
   considered chronically degraded by livestock grazing.
   Methods: Three paired exclosures (ungrazed, and macropod-grazed) were
   compared with open-grazed areas after 25 years using quadrats located on
   either side of the fences. Additionally, the regional flora for mulga
   dry forest was assessed to identify species that may have declined and
   could be threatened by grazing.
   Results: Low herbaceous biomass accumulation (< 1.3 tha(-1)) with full
   grazing protection confirmed a low productivity environment. For most
   plant life forms the highest species richness was in macropod-grazed
   exclosures, an intermediate grazing disturbance that best approximates
   the evolutionary history of the environment. This was the net outcome of
   species that both declined and increased in response to grazing.
   Regeneration and subsequent self-thinning of mulga was promoted with
   grazing protection, but did not confound interpretation of species
   richness and abundance responses. At the regional scale only 11 native
   species out of 407 comprising the mulga dry forest flora were identified
   as rare and potentially threatened by grazing.
   Conclusions: Significant increases in richness or abundance of native
   plants with grazing protection, persistence of perennial grasses,
   regeneration of mulga and scant evidence of a major decline in the
   regional flora are not consistent with established assertions that
   long-grazed mulga dry forest has crossed functional thresholds that
   limit recovery. Further, a peak in species richness under intermediate
   (macropod) grazing is counter to the shape of the response predicted by
   emerging theory for recovery of species richness in a low productivity
   environment. The finding prompts a more thorough understanding of the
   distinction between environments with inherently low productivity and
   those degraded by grazing.}},

Abstract = {{During the past 50 years development of farming practices caused
   tremendous changes in European agricultural landscapes and many insect
   species became increasingly restricted to protected areas. Yet little is
   known about long-term trends of insect diversity and community
   composition in these often small reserves. We performed a comparative
   study on changes in orthopteran communities of protected dry grasslands
   in East Germany, which had been surveyed in the 1960s. Applying the same
   sampling techniques, we revisited 26 of the original sites in 2008 and
   2009. Nearly all sites are controlled by conservation policies and
   changes in vegetation composition were relatively small, although some
   sites showed shrub encroachment. Changes in orthopteran diversity were
   not significant. Community composition showed minor changes which were
   correlated with evidence of woody plant encroachment as derived from
   historical and recent aerial imagery. The frequency of some Caelifera
   species decreased from the 1960s to 2008/2009 with one species
   inhabiting bare soils (Myrmeleotettix maculatus) showing the strongest
   decline. Some Ensifera, especially two species inhabiting open woodland
   and scrub (Tettigonia viridissima, Phaneroptera falcata) showed positive
   trends. Nevertheless, three different regions (each belonging to a
   different German federal state) had shown distinct orthopteran
   assemblages in the 1960s, and these were equally different 40 years
   later. We conclude that the orthopteran fauna of Central European
   protected dry grasslands showed small changes in species composition,
   and overall diversity remained rather constant during the past 40 years,
   which is in accordance with the minor changes in the surrounding
   landscape. Consequently, the applied conservation management
   practises-mainly sheep grazing and trimming-are largely effective.}},

Abstract = {{The tree-grass co-existence in savannas involves multiple and sometimes

   and transitions (gradual or abrupt) to other vegetation types (i.e.,
   grassland or forest) are fundamental for the management of ecosystems
   and for preserving the biodiversity in present conditions and in future
   changing scenarios. Here we investigate the savanna domain within
   grazers-fire and browsers-fire parameter planes through a simple
   ecohydrological model of tree-grass-soil water dynamics. Stability maps
   allow to identify savanna domains and to show the behavior of vegetation
   under increasing pressure of grazing and browsing. Stability maps shed
   light on the causes behind possible vegetation abrupt transitions (e.g.,
   forest collapse and bush encroachment). An application to 15 African
   savannas sites is presented and discussed with the support of a local
   sensitivity analysis of the model's parameters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Indicators of rangeland health generally do not include a measure of
   biodiversity. Increasing attention to maintaining biodiversity in
   rangelands suggests that this omission should be reconsidered, and plant
   species richness and diversity are two metrics that may be useful and
   appropriate. Ideally, their response to a variety of anthropogenic and
   natural drivers in the ecosystem of interest would be clearly
   understood, thereby providing a means to diagnose the cause of decline
   in an ecosystem. Conceptual ecological models based on ecological
   principles and hypotheses provide a framework for this understanding,
   but these models must be supported by empirical evidence if they are to
   be used for decision making. To that end, we synthesize results from
   published studies regarding the responses of plant species richness and
   diversity to drivers that are of management concern in Great Plains
   grasslands, one of North America's most imperiled ecosystems. In the
   published literature, moderate grazing generally has a positive effect
   on these metrics in tallgrass prairie and a neutral to negative effect
   in shortgrass prairie. The largest published effects on richness and
   diversity were caused by moderate grazing in tallgrass prairies and
   nitrogen fertilization in shortgrass prairies. Although weather is often
   cited as the reason for considerable annual fluctuations in richness and
   diversity, little information about the responses of these metrics to
   weather is available. Responses of the two metrics often diverged,
   reflecting differences in their sensitivity to different types of
   changes in the plant community. Although sufficient information has not
   yet been published for these metrics to meet all the criteria of a good
   indicator in Great Plains Grasslands, augmenting current methods of
   evaluating rangeland health with a measure of plant species richness
   would reduce these shortcomings and provide information critical to
   managing for biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing is one of the prevalent human activities that even today are
   taking place inside protected areas with direct or indirect effects on
   ecosystems. In this study we analyzed the effects of grazing on plant
   species diversity, plant functional group (PFG) diversity and community
   composition of shrublands. We analyzed plant diversity data from 582
   sampling plots located in 66 protected areas of the Greek Natura 2000
   network, containing in total 1102 plant species and subspecies. We also
   classified a priori all plant species in seven PFGs: annual forbs,
   annual grasses/sedges, legumes, perennial forbs, perennial
   grasses/sedges, small shrubs and tall shrubs. For each site, grazing
   intensity was estimated in four classes (no grazing, low, medium and
   high grazing intensity). We found that, at the spatial and temporal
   scale of this study, as grazing intensity increased, so did total
   species richness. However, each PFG displayed a different response to
   grazing. Short-lived species (annual grasses or forbs and legumes)
   benefited from grazing and their species richness and proportion in the
   community increased with grazing. Perennial grasses and forbs species
   richness increased with grazing intensity, but their dominance
   decreased, since their proportion in the community declined. Short shrub
   species richness remained unaffected by grazing, while tall shrub
   diversity decreased. Finally, in sites without grazing the spatial
   pattern of species richness of the different PFGs was not congruent with
   each other, while in grazed sites they were significantly positively
   correlated (with the exception of tall shrubs). This finding may imply
   that grazing is a selective pressure organizing the community structure,
   and imposing a certain contribution of each PFG. So, in Mediterranean
   shrublands in protected areas with a long historical record of grazing,
   it seems that grazing promotes species diversity and its continuation on
   a portion of the landscape may be a necessary part of an effective
   management plan.}},

   provide ecosystem goods and services and support an industry
   contributing over \$124 billion globally. Golf courses can impact
   positively on local biodiversity however their role in the global carbon
   cycle is not clearly understood. To explore this relationship, the
   balance between plant-soil system sequestration and greenhouse gas
   emissions from turf management on golf courses was modelled. Input data
   were derived from published studies of emissions from agriculture and
   turfgrass management. Two UK case studies of golf course type were used,
   a Links course (coastal, medium intensity management, within coastal
   dune grasses) and a Parkland course (inland, high intensity management,
   within woodland).
   Playing surfaces of both golf courses were marginal net sources of
   greenhouse gas emissions due to maintenance (Links -2.2 +/- 0.4 Mg
   CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1); Parkland -2.0 +/- 0.4 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1)). A
   significant proportion of emissions were from the use of nitrogen
   fertiliser, especially on tees and greens such that 3\% of the golf
   course area contributed 16\% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The area
   of trees on a golf course was important in determining whole-course
   emission balance. On the Parkland course, emissions from maintenance
   were offset by sequestration from turfgrass, and trees which comprised
   48\% of total area, resulting in a net balance of -5.4 +/- 0.9 Mg CO(2)e
   ha(-1) y(-1). On the Links course, the proportion of trees was much
   lower (2\%) and sequestration from links grassland resulted in a net
   balance of -1.6 +/- 0.3 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1) y(-1). Recommendations for golf
   course management and design include the reduction of nitrogen
   fertiliser, improved operational efficiency when mowing, the inclusion
   of appropriate tree-planting and the scaling of component areas to
   maximise golf course sequestration capacity. The findings are
   transferrable to the management and design of urban parks and gardens,
   which range between fairways and greens in intensity of management. (C)

Abstract = {{Nutrient availability and herbivory can regulate primary production in
   ecosystems, but little is known about how, or whether, they may interact
   with one another. Here, we investigate how nitrogen availability and
   insect herbivory interact to alter aboveground and belowground plant
   community biomass in an old-field ecosystem. In 2004, we established 36
   experimental plots in which we manipulated soil nitrogen (N)
   availability and insect abundance in a completely randomized plot
   design. In 2009, after 6 years of treatments, we measured aboveground
   biomass and assessed root production at peak growth. Overall, we found a
   significant effect of reduced soil N availability on aboveground biomass
   and belowground plant biomass production. Specifically, responses of
   aboveground and belowground community biomass to nutrients were driven
   by reductions in soil N, but not additions, indicating that soil N may
   not be limiting primary production in this ecosystem. Insects reduced
   the aboveground biomass of subdominant plant species and decreased
   coarse root production. We found no statistical interactions between N
   availability and insect herbivory for any response variable. Overall,
   the results of 6 years of nutrient manipulations and insect removals
   suggest strong bottom-up influences on total plant community
   productivity but more subtle effects of insect herbivores on aspects of
   aboveground and belowground production.}},

Title = {{Defining the limit to resistance in a drought-tolerant grassland:
   long-term severe drought significantly reduces the dominant species and
   increases ruderals}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1500-1507}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{1. Models predict that the duration and intensity of drought will
   increase under future climate regimes. Although semi-arid grasslands are
   adapted to moisture limitation, the sensitivity of semi-arid grassland
   vegetation to extreme and sustained dry periods that may occur in the
   future has not been tested.
   2. In this study, we analysed vegetation cover data from an 11-year
   drought manipulation in the semi-arid shortgrass steppe in Colorado,
   USA. We examined changes in total vegetation cover, dominant plant
   (Bouteloua gracilis) cover and ruderal cover in plots receiving 25\% and
   50\% of ambient precipitation during the growing season.
   3. We found that 11 years of drought resulted in large reductions in
   total cover and cover of the dominant species, but significant
   differences did not emerge until the 4th and 7th year of drought.
   Drought severity significantly influenced the degree to which ruderal
   cover increased in the later period of the drought, but reductions in B.
   gracilis cover under drought were not significantly different under
   different drought severities. Bouteloua gracilis reduction did
   correspond strongly with increases in ruderal cover and species
   richness, suggesting that the dominant species plays a strong role in
   maintaining the structure of communities in the shortgrass steppe.
   4. Synthesis. Our results suggest that the shortgrass steppe, and most
   notably the dominant species B. gracilis, can be significantly perturbed
   by long-term droughts that may be more common in future decades. By
   quantifying the resistance-limit of a drought-tolerant system, our
   results can inform theories of stability and management decisions for
   grassland systems under new climate regimes and provide a new temporal
   context for previous and future manipulation studies.}},

Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Achieving economically optimum livestock production on rangelands can
   conflict with conservation strategies that require lower stocking rate
   to maintain wildlife habitat. Combining the spatial and temporal
   interaction of fire and grazing (pyric-herbivory) is a
   conservation-based approach to management that increases rangeland
   biodiversity by creating heterogeneous vegetation structure and
   composition. However, livestock production under pyric-herbivory has not
   been reported. In both mixed-grass prairie and tallgrass prairie, we
   compared livestock production in pastures with traditional fire and
   grazing management (continuous grazing, with periodic fire on tallgrass
   prairie and without fire on mixed-grass prairie) and conservation-based
   management (pyric-herbivory applied through patch burning) at a moderate
   stocking rate. Stocker cattle weight gain, calf weight gain, and cow
   body condition score did not differ (P < 0.05) between traditional and
   conservation-based management at the tallgrass prairie site for the
   duration of the 8-yr study. At the mixed-grass prairie site, stocker
   cattle gain did not differ in the first 4 yr, but stocker cattle gained
   more (P <= 0.05) on conservation-based management and remained 27\%
   greater for the duration of the 11-yr study. Moreover, variation among
   years in cattle performance was less on pastures under conservation
   management. Traditional management in mixed-grass prairie did not
   include fire, the process that likely was associated with increased
   stocker cattle performance under conservation management. We conclude
   that pyric-herbivory is a conservation-based rangeland management
   strategy that returns fire to the landscape without reduced stocking
   rate, deferment, or rest.}},

Abstract = {{The tension between pyrophytic hummock grasslands and fire-sensitive
   mulga shrubland is a major ecological theme in central Australia. On a
   sandplain on the edge of the Tanami Desert, grassland and shrubland are
   juxtaposed with abrupt boundaries that cut across a subtle environmental
   gradient. We compare woody plant diversity among vegetation types and
   explore correlates of the distribution of woody plant species. Alpha
   diversity in grassland and shrubland was almost identical, but
   plot-level species richness was greater in grassland. Gamma (landscape)
   diversity was scarcely greater than alpha diversity. Few long-lived
   plants, and not even the dominant hummock grass and shrub, were
   exclusively associated with one vegetation type, but most common species
   were aligned with elements - soil texture, fire frequency and the extent
   of physical soil crusting - that characterise the environmental gradient
   between vegetation types. Most species were resprouters and there was no
   tendency for obligate seeders or facultative resprouters to be
   associated with the less fire-prone shrubland. Our data are consistent
   with the suggestion that hummock grasslands and mulga shrubland are
   alternative stable states maintained by fire-soil feedback loops and
   possibly also by competitive exclusion of pyrophytic species by Acacia
   aneura. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plant-plant interactions play a key role in regulating the composition
   of communities. The outcome of interactions is the net effect of both
   positive and negative interactions. Positive interactions (facilitation)
   are defined as non-trophic interactions that increase the average
   individual fitness of at least one of the species involved. The study
   area was the Salinas and Aguada Blanca National Reserve, in the southern
   Peruvian Andes, composed of Festuca orthophylla grassland (dry Puna).
   The research goals were to ascertain whether spatial interactions act in
   this plant community, in order to determine whether beneficiary species
   have speciesspecific spatial associations. Our findings indicate that
   the most important nurses were the tall tussock species. A direct
   correlation was observed between the dimension of the F. orthophylla
   tussocks and the number of beneficiary species. Twelve species were
   closely associated with nurse species; five occurred in relation with
   nurse plants but without any preference for one of them; four species
   grew both isolated and in relationship with nurse plants and six species
   mostly grew isolated on bare soil. Because of the impact of grazers,
   some plants cannot grow on open ground; in fact, the species most in
   need of spatial interactions are those without avoidance strategies
   and/or with broad leaves. F. orthophylla is the core of a clumped
   spatial pattern of vegetation. The importance of spatial interactions
   for biodiversity conservation seems to be closely related to
   environmental amelioration and to grazer activity because plants of low
   palatability often serve as biotic refuges for palatable plants.}},

Abstract = {{The agreement between the death (DA) and the living (LA) molluscs
   assemblages is analyzed in an infralittoral off-shore reef in the
   Central Tyrrhenian Sea ({''}Secche di Tor Paterno{''} Marine Protected
   Area) with extensive coralligenous and Posidonia oceanica biocoenoses.
   These biocoenoses host a highly diverse assemblage of small sized
   species. The work has a high species resolution and takes into
   consideration the richest but also more taxonomically difficult size
   class (1-6 mm). DAs contain allochthonous species which mainly live in
   deeper soft substrates but also contain species which were
   under-represented in the LA samples because they are endolithic or
   cemented to hard substrates, although such species are numerically rare.
   Multivariate analysis shows there are significant differences between
   living and death assemblages within habitats, but also that DAs are able
   to discriminate the two types of habitat Fidelity of species richness
   and evenness is better in the coralligenous biocoenosis rather than in
   the P. oceanica meadow. This may be due to the reduced transport of
   shells out of the rhizome layer due to its reduced hydrodynamism due to
   the effect of the canopy. The good fidelity in the coralligenous
   biocoenosis suggests that the situation is close to complete ergodic
   mixing that draws individuals that coexisted or potentially coexisted in
   the same habitat into the DA The lower fidelity in the P. oceanica
   meadow suggests incomplete ergodic mixing which can occur when
   within-habitat spatial mixing does not result in homogenization of dead
   skeletal material because transportation is non-uniform. Marked
   differences in species abundance between the LA and the DA are observed
   in both habitats and the result is consistent with previous works in
   similar habitats. Among the factors influencing fidelity, we hypothesize
   that trophic guild and life span of species may influence species
   abundance because carnivores and scavengers are more abundant in the
   living assemblage while microalgae herbivores are more abundant in the
   death assemblage. This difference in the fidelity of guild abundance may
   be connected to the different life span of species because many
   herbivores have short life span while carnivores and scavengers have
   long life span, although this issue needs to be further tested. On the
   contrary, temporal changes in community composition and individual
   preservation rate are not considered to influence fidelity
   significantly. The study suggests low bottom transport of dead shells in
   these habitats. This work opens good prospects for biodiversity
   assessments on the basis of DAs because it allows reduced diving and
   field time and better faunistic description due to time-averaging.
   However, dead specimens tend to lose important diagnostic characters and
   may require more skilled personnel for sorting and identification. (C)

Abstract = {{Based on literature data and own fieldwork in Tadzhikistan (Middle
   Asia), the taxonomic structure, distribution, habitat preferences as
   well as conservation state of a group of 1486 species of vascular plants
   of endemic and sub-endemic character are presented. In addition to
   verifying the number of endemics, the present study has shown that
   Tadzhik endemics are the most numerous in the northwest of the country,
   in the Gissar-Darvasian and Zeravshan regions. An analysis of average
   richness of endemics per surface unit has revealed that Gissar-Darvasian
   F is the richest area. An assessment of the taxonomic similarity of
   geobotanical regions based on endemic species composition has shown that
   differences in general correspond to the geobotanical subdivision of
   Tadzhikistan. The endemics studied are stenochoric species with a
   distributional area for endemics sensu stricto varying between ca.486
   and 111,489 km(2) (average 12,478 km(2)) and between 11,830 and 349,473
   km(2) (mean 74,097 km(2)) for sub-endemics. The habitats harbouring the
   richest group of endemics are steppes and semi-savannas, alpine forests,
   xerothermophilous shrubs, alpine meadows and swards. The most numerous
   endemic groups have been recorded from altitudes of around 1800, 2000
   and 2500 m above sea level. The most important threats to Tadzhik
   endemics are intensive grazing and erosion of soils, as well as
   denudation. Vegetation types most vulnerable to human impact are forest
   and scrub communities. For effective protection of endemics a greater
   involvement of international organisations as well as legal and
   organisational changes in the Republic of Tadzhikistan are needed. (C)

Title = {{The Impact of Overgrazing on Dung Beetle Diversity in the Italian
   Maritime Alps}},

Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are undoubtedly the most typical
   and ecologically relevant insects of grazed alpine habitats because they
   provide valuable ecological services such as biological pest control and
   soil fertilization. Despite the great ecological contribution of these
   insects to pasture ecosystem functioning, little is known about their
   direct or indirect relationships with pastoral activities. The main aim
   of the study was to assess whether dung beetle diversity was influenced
   by different intensities of cattle grazing. Dung beetle communities of
   two adjacent alpine valleys within the Maritime Alps Natural Park
   (north-western Italian Alps), representing overgrazed and ungrazed
   pastures, were studied by pitfall trapping. A hierarchical design (three
   levels: valleys, transects, and replicates) was established for additive
   partitioning of gamma-diversity and Indicator Species Analysis. Evenness
   and Shannon diversity were significantly higher at the ungrazed than at
   the overgrazed site because abundances were much more evenly distributed
   at the former than at the latter site (where one species was dominant
   over all the others). Dung beetle abundance and species richness of the
   overgrazed graminaceous pasture vegetation types were in most cases
   significantly lower than those of the ungrazed nongraminaceous
   vegetation type. In the additive partitioning of gamma-diversity
   analysis relative to the whole study area, the randomization procedure
   indicated that the contribution of beta to gamma-diversity was
   significantly different from that expected by chance, suggesting that
   one or more environmental factors has intervened to change the partition
   of total diversity in the system considered. The analysis of the
   preferences and fidelity of species (Indicator Species Analysis) showed
   that only one species chose overgrazed pastures; all the others
   positively selected the ungrazed site, or the only ungrazed pasture
   vegetation type (Rumicetum alpini Beger) occurring at the overgrazed
   site. Results conformed to evidences that overgrazing represents a
   serious threat to the conservation of alpine dung beetles. To conserve
   local dung beetle assemblages, especially in protected areas, cattle
   overgrazing should be avoided. This does not mean, however, that
   pastoral activities are incompatible with biodiversity conservation. The
   contemporaneous presence of wild ungulates and low intensity extensive
   pastoral activities may be useful to preserve both local dung beetle
   assemblages and alpine pasture ecosystems.}},

Title = {{Differential responses of bumblebees and diurnal Lepidoptera to
   vegetation succession in long-term set-aside}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1251-1259}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. Establishing temporal habitat patches, such as long-term set-aside,
   is potentially a valuable approach to support pollinator populations in
   intensively cultivated landscapes. The benefits of this approach are
   expected to differ between pollinator groups, because of fundamental
   differences in their ecology.
   2. We studied the responses of two pollinator groups, bumblebees and
   diurnal Lepidoptera (butterflies and diurnal moths), to the vegetation
   succession in experimental set-aside during six consecutive years. The
   pollinators were monitored in 24 large treatment plots (50 x 50 m), sown
   with three different seed mixtures (competitive and two alternatives)
   and unmanaged or managed by mowing, and on 10 surrounding field margins.
   3. The responses of the two pollinator groups to vegetation succession
   were distinctly different. Bumblebees showed a very strong positive
   response to the diverse seed mixture with abundant floral resources, and
   their abundance peaked in the first year. The species richness and
   abundance of Lepidoptera were increased gradually, suggesting
   differential colonization speeds of species and a gradual establishment
   of populations. Lepidopteran abundance reached the level of the field
   margins in 3 years, whereas the corresponding species richness level was
   not reached. The benefits of the alternative seed mixtures were less
   pronounced in Lepidoptera than in bumblebees. No effects of the mowing
   treatment on either species group were detected.
   4. Within both pollinator groups, the response to vegetation succession
   was associated with species traits. In bumblebees, long-tongued species
   (indicating specialization) were increased during succession. In
   butterflies and diurnal moths, colonization success of species was
   strongly correlated with their wing span (indicating mobility). The most
   successful colonizers in butterflies were grass feeders and in diurnal
   moths the species feeding on leguminous plants at the larval stage.
   5. Synthesis and applications. The ecological requirements of different
   pollinator groups should be taken into account when establishing
   set-aside. Supporting bumblebees is possible even on short-term
   set-aside, assuming nectar and pollen sources are made available. The
   occurrence of butterflies and diurnal moths is strongly driven by
   additional factors, such as the availability of larval host plants as
   well as adult mobility, which calls for set-aside management regimes to
   be in place for several years.}},

Title = {{Plant diversity partitioning in grazed Mediterranean grassland at
   multiple spatial and temporal scales}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{1260-1268}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{1. Grazing by large ungulates may affect plant species richness and
   diversity at multiple spatial and/or temporal scales, because grazing
   affects small-scale resource heterogeneity and plant interactions at the
   local scale, while effects at the landscape scale are related to grazing
   intensity and timing.
   2. We used diversity partitioning to analyse long-and short-term effects
   of cattle grazing on plant species richness and diversity in an
   experimental spatial hierarchy in Mediterranean annual grassland.
   Short-term changes during secondary succession in grazed plots
   (2003-2005) at two grazing intensities (heavy and moderate) were
   analysed and compared with long-term protected vegetation. We applied
   Hill's q-diversity metrics at q = 0 (species richness) and q = 2
   (reciprocal Simpson diversity) to examine the partitioning of species
   richness and diversity between their alpha (alpha) and beta (beta)
   components in the different treatments at four spatial scales: quadrats,
   within exclosures, within plots, within treatments.
   3. At q = 0, alpha-diversity was always significantly lower, and
   beta-diversity significantly higher, than predicted by the randomised
   null model. Diversity partitioning at q = 2 showed a similar trend at
   the quadrat scale. At the exclosure scale, partitioning exhibited a
   similar trend during the first 2 years of secondary succession but did
   not deviate from the null model in the third year, as observed in
   protected vegetation in all years.
   4. At q = 0, diversity decreased across all treatments in the short
   term. At q = 2, diversity was initially higher in grazed plots than in
   protected vegetation; alpha and beta components both decreased during
   secondary succession, to the levels observed in the protected
   vegetation.
   5. Synthesis and applications. Lower dominance in grazed vegetation
   indicates that grazing affects competitive exclusion at the local, small
   scale and accentuates natural heterogeneity (e.g. patchiness of soil
   resources, presence of rocks in the landscape) at a larger scale. The
   results of this study emphasise the importance of grazing as a
   management tool for maintaining plant diversity at multiple scales. This
   is a major concern worldwide, as the area covered by natural ecosystems
   continues to dwindle, necessitating management of grasslands for
   multiple functions such as animal production, resource protection and
   wildlife enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{1. Grazing has been implicated in the decline of heather-dominated
   moorlands in Britain, but there has been little consideration of the
   effects of different species of herbivores on plant diversity. Sheep
   stocks have recently decreased in Scotland, and quantification of how
   this affects biodiversity is essential for understanding how different
   grazing regimes modify upland habitats.
   2. We investigated the effects of grazing on plant biodiversity in
   heather/grass mosaics at 16 upland sites in Scotland. Red deer Cervus
   elaphus L. were present at all sites, but sheep Ovis aries L. had been
   removed from half of the sites. Our experimental design incorporated
   replication at three spatial scales, from a landscape level down to 10 x
   10 m plots.
   3. We quantified the relative effects of different herbivore species,
   vegetation structure and rainfall on heather utilisation, species
   richness and evenness (alpha diversity; Shannon-Wiener index) and beta
   diversity.
   4. At all spatial scales, deer dung counts were higher and heather was
   shorter when sheep were absent. Furthermore, utilisation of heather was
   positively correlated with the amount of deer dung, the amount of grass
   present and smooth grass height.
   5. Alpha diversity was consistently positively correlated with the
   relative amount of grass, but was also positively related to the amount
   of sheep dung at the largest spatial scale. At the finest scale, alpha
   diversity was negatively correlated with the amount of deer dung. Beta
   diversity was higher when sheep were present at all scales.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Mixed grazing by sheep and deer appears
   to be beneficial for increasing both alpha and beta diversity and
   minimizing damage to heather in the uplands. The absence of sheep is
   likely to result in expanding deer populations and greater impact on
   heather. Management of grazing herbivores is an important tool for
   maintaining biodiversity in many ecosystems. Our results indicate that
   reducing livestock may alter the impacts of wild grazers on their
   habitats and drive changes in diversity, whereas mixed grazing can
   enhance habitat quality and maintain plant diversity. Therefore, this
   effect should be considered when devising policy recommendations.}},

Abstract = {{1. Seed bank and seed rain represent dispersal in time and space. They
   can be important sources of diversity in the rural landscape, where
   fragmented habitats are linked by their histories.
   2. Seed bank, seed rain and above-ground vegetation were sampled in four
   habitat types (abandoned semi-natural grassland (ABA), grazed former
   arable field (FAF), mid-field islet (MFI) and grazed semi-natural
   grassland (SNG)) in a rural landscape in southern Sweden, to examine
   whether community patterns can be distinguished at large spatial scales
   and whether seed bank and seed rain are best explained by current, past
   or intended future vegetation communities.
   3. We counted 54 357 seedlings of 188 species from 1190 seed bank and
   797 seed rain samples. Seed bank, seed rain and above-ground vegetation
   communities differed according to habitat. Several species
   characteristic of managed grassland vegetation were present in the seed
   bank, seed rain and vegetation of the other habitats.
   4. The seed banks of SNGs and the seed rain of the FAFs were generally
   better predicted by the surrounding above-ground vegetation than were
   the other habitat types. The seed rain of the grazed communities was
   most similar to the vegetation in the FAFs, while the seed banks of the
   abandoned grasslands most resembled the vegetation in SNGs.
   5. Gap availability and seed input could be limiting the colonisation of
   target species in FAFs, while remnant populations in the seed bank and
   the presence of grassland specialists in the above-ground vegetation
   indicate that abandoned grasslands and mid-field islets could be
   valuable sources of future diversity in the landscape after restoration.
   6. Synthesis and applications. SNG communities are able to form seed
   banks which survive land-use change, but their seed rain does not
   reflect their above-ground communities. It is important that grassland
   plants set seed. By connecting existing grasslands with restoration
   targets, increased disturbance in the target habitats would allow for
   colonisation via the seed bank or seed rain, while decreased grazing
   intensity would benefit seed production in the source grasslands.
   Otherwise, landscape-wide propagule availability might increase with a
   more varied timing and intensity of management.}},

Title = {{Conservation Easements in California Blue Oak Woodlands: Testing the

Abstract = {{Blue oak woodland is an endemic natural community in the Central Valley
   region of California. It is dominated by blue oak (Quercus douglasii
   Hook. \& Am.) and has an understory of annual grasses and forbs. Most
   blue oak woodlands are found on privately owned cattle ranches which are
   currently threatened by conversion to housing, vineyards, and cropland.
   Land trusts are acquiring conservation easements which include terms
   that allow for continued commercial grazing. Some studies suggest that
   livestock grazing negatively impacts biodiversity, although others show
   that it creates a beneficial disturbance regime and can play an
   important role in controlling invasive plants. There is also concern
   that grazing may be negatively impacting blue oak seedling regeneration.
   Our study begins to address the assumption that livestock grazing is a
   conservation-compatible land use on ranches with conservation easements.
   Our study questions whether livestock grazing reduces oak seedling
   density, if invasive non-native plants such as medusahead (Taeniatherum
   caput-medusae L.) are reduced, and if native species richness is
   promoted. We monitored oak seedling density and herbaceous plant species
   cover in grazing exclosures over a period of five years on five cattle
   ranches in eastern Tehama County. Ranches were all grazed under easement
   terms set by The Nature Conservancy. Our study demonstrates that
   commercial livestock grazing practices had mixed affects on some of the
   conservation values of blue oak woodlands. Livestock grazing reduced oak
   seedling density, but it remains unknown if reduced densities will
   affect the long-term reproduction and health of the woodlands. Grazing
   also reduced the cover of invasive medusahead grass; yet native species
   richness and cover were not improved by livestock grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Exotic-dominated ecosystems with low diversity are becoming increasingly
   common. It remains unclear, though, whether differences between native
   and exotic species (driver model), or changes in disturbances or
   resources (passenger model), allow exotics to become competitive
   dominants. In our field experiment, plant species origin (native or
   exotic), cattle grazing (ungrazed or intensely grazed once), and species
   composition treatments were fully crossed and randomly assigned to
   four-species mixtures and monocultures of grassland plants. We found
   that biodiversity declined more rapidly in exotic than in native species
   mixtures, regardless of our grazing disturbance treatment. Early
   declines in species evenness (i.e., increases in dominance) led to
   subsequent declines in species richness (i.e., local extinctions) in
   exotic mixtures. Specifically, Simpson's diversity was 29\% lower after
   1 year, and species richness was 15\% lower after 3 years, in exotic
   than in native mixtures. These rapid biodiversity declines in exotic
   mixtures were partly explained by decreased complementarity (i.e., niche
   partitioning and facilitation), presumably because exotic species lack
   the coevolutionary history that can lead to complementarity and
   coexistence in native communities. Thus, our results suggest that exotic
   species can drive biodiversity declines in the presence or absence of a
   grazing disturbance, partly because exotic species interactions differ
   from native species interactions. This implies that restoring plant
   biodiversity in grasslands may require removal of exotic species, in
   addition to disturbance management.}},

Abstract = {{Edaphic fauna contributes to important ecosystem functions in grassland
   soils such as decomposition and nutrient mineralization. Since this
   functional role is likely to be altered by global change and associated
   shifts in plant communities, a thorough understanding of large scale
   drivers on below-ground processes independent of regional differences in
   soil type or climate is essential. We investigated the relationship
   between abiotic (soil properties, management practices) and biotic
   (plant functional group composition, vegetation characteristics, soil
   fauna abundance) predictors and feeding activity of soil fauna after
   accounting for sample year and study region. Our study was carried out
   over a period of two consecutive years in 92 agricultural grasslands in
   three regions of Germany, spanning a latitudinal gradient of more than
   500 km. A structural equation model suggests that feeding activity of
   soil fauna as measured by the bait-lamina test was positively related to
   legume and grass species richness in both years. Most probably, a
   diverse vegetation promotes feeding activity of soil fauna via
   alterations of both microclimate and resource availability. Feeding
   activity of soil fauna also increased with earthworm biomass via a
   pathway over Collembola abundance. The effect of earthworms on the
   feeding activity in soil may be attributed to their important role as
   ecosystem engineers. As no additional effects of agricultural management
   such as fertilization, livestock density or number of cuts on bait
   consumption were observed, our results suggest that the positive effect
   of legume and grass species richness on the feeding activity in soil
   fauna is a general one that will not be overruled by regional
   differences in management or environmental conditions. We thus suggest
   that agri-environment schemes aiming at the protection of belowground
   activity and associated ecosystem functions in temperate grasslands may
   generally focus on maintaining plant diversity, especially with regard
   to the potential effects of climate change on future vegetation
   structure. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Grasslands used to be vital landscape elements throughout Europe.
   Nowadays, the area of grasslands is dramatically reduced, especially in
   industrial countries. Grassland restoration is widely applied to
   increase the naturalness of the landscape and preserve biodiversity. We
   reviewed the most frequently used restoration techniques (spontaneous
   succession, sowing seed mixtures, transfer of plant material, topsoil
   removal and transfer) and techniques used to improve species richness
   (planting, grazing and mowing) to recover natural-like grasslands from
   ex-arable lands. We focus on the usefulness of methods in restoring
   biodiversity, their practical feasibility and costs. We conclude that
   the success of each technique depends on the site conditions, history,
   availability of propagules and/or donor sites, and on the budget and
   time available for restoration. Spontaneous succession can be an option
   for restoration when no rapid result is expected, and is likely to lead
   to the target in areas with high availability of propagules. Sowing
   low-diversity seed mixtures is recommended when we aim at to create
   basic grassland vegetation in large areas and/or in a short time. The
   compilation of high-diversity seed mixtures for large sites is rather
   difficult and expensive; thus, it may be applied rather on smaller
   areas. We recommend combining the two kinds of seed sowing methods by
   sowing low-diversity mixtures in a large area and high-diversity
   mixtures in small blocks to create species-rich source patches for the
   spontaneous colonization of nearby areas. When proper local hay sources
   are available, the restoration with plant material transfer can be a

Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to identify the habitat types listed in the
   Habitats Directive Annex I that require low-intensity agricultural
   management for their existence. We assessed the link between the Annex I
   habitat types and agricultural practices in order to identify habitat
   types that depend on the continuation of agricultural practices or whose
   existence is prolonged or spatially enlarged via blocking or reducing
   the secondary succession by agricultural activities. 63 habitat types
   that depend on or which can profit from agricultural activities-mainly
   grazing and mowing-were identified. They are classified into 2 groups:
   (1) habitats fully dependent on the continuation of agricultural
   management; (2) habitats partly dependent on the continuation of
   agricultural management. This paper also briefly discusses habitat types
   for which either doubts remain on their dependence on agricultural
   management, or the relation to extensive farming practices exists only
   in part of their area of distribution in Europe or under certain site
   conditions, respectively. Assessments of the conservation status of
   habitats of European Importance by 25 EU Member States in 2007 showed
   that habitats identified by us as depending on agricultural practices
   had a worse status than non-agricultural habitats.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity conservation organisations have recently begun to consider
   a wider ecosystem services context for their activities. While the
   literature suggests the potential of `win-win' situations where
   biodiversity conservation and the delivery of ecosystem services
   overlap, empirical evidence is wanting. Here we explore the role that
   species-led management for the benefit of biodiversity in cultural
   landscapes can play in the delivery of wider ecosystem services. We use
   UK lowland wetlands as a case study and show how successful delivery of
   species-led conservation through management interventions relies on
   practices that can affect greenhouse gas fluxes, water quality and
   regulation, and cultural benefits. In these wetlands, livestock grazing
   has potentially large effects on water and greenhouse gas related
   services, but there is little scope to alter management without
   compromising species objectives. Likewise, there is little potential to
   alter reedbed management without compromising conservation objectives.
   There is some potential to alter woodland and scrub management, but this
   would likely have limited influence due to the relatively small area
   over which such management is practiced. The management of water levels
   potentially has large effects on provision of several services and there
   does appear to be some scope to align this objective with biodiversity
   objectives. A comprehensive understanding of the net costs and benefits
   to society of these interventions will require fine-grained research
   integrating ecological, economic and social science research. However, a
   less analytic understanding of the potential costs and benefits can
   highlight ways by which land management principally to achieve
   biodiversity conservation objectives might be modified to enhance
   delivery of other ecosystem services.}},

Abstract = {{Air pollutants are recognised as important agents of ecosystem change

   gradient study of UK acid grasslands. The community composition of these
   grasslands is related to climate, grazing, ozone exposure and nitrogen
   deposition, with evidence for an interaction between the ecological
   impacts of base cation and nitrogen deposition. Ozone is a key agent in
   species compositional change but is not associated with a reduction in
   species richness or diversity indices, showing the subtly different
   drivers on these two aspects of ecosystem degradation. Our results
   demonstrate the effects of multiple interacting pollutants, which may
   collectively have a greater impact than any individual agent. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Understory plants could can act as indicators of temperate forest
   sustainability, health and conservation status due to their importance
   in ecosystem function. Harvesting impacts on understory plant diversity
   depends on their intensity. Variable retention has been proposed to
   mitigate the harmful effects of timber harvesting, but its effectiveness
   remains unknown in southern Patagonian Nothofagus pumilio forests. The
   objectives of this study were to: (i) define a baseline of understory
   plant diversity in old-growth forests along a site quality gradient and
   under canopy gaps; (ii) evaluate stands with three different variable
   retention treatments compared to old-growth forests; and (iii) assess
   temporal changes during 4 years after harvesting (YAH). A 61 ha N.
   pumilio forest was selected. Understory plant (Dicotyledonae,
   Monocotyledonae and Pteridophyta) richness, cover (including woody
   debris and bare forest floor) and above-ground dry biomass were
   characterized in summer for 5 years. Before harvesting, baseline samples
   were conducted along a site quality gradient and outside/inside canopy
   gaps. Analyzed treatments include a control of old-growth forest (OGF)
   and three different harvesting treatments with variable retention: (i)
   dispersed retention (DR) of 30 m(2) ha(-1) (20-30\% retention); (ii)
   aggregated retention (AR) with one aggregate per hectare and clear-cuts
   (28\% retention); and (iii) combined dispersed and aggregated retention
   (DAR) with one aggregate per hectare and dispersed retention of 10-15
   m(2) ha(-1) (40-50\% retention). Data analyses included parametric and
   permutational ANOVAs, multivariate classification and ordinations.
   Before harvesting, 31 plant species were found, where richness, cover
   and biomass were directly related to site quality. The presence of
   canopy gaps did not have a significant impact on the measured variables.
   After harvesting, 20 new species appeared from adjacent associated
   environments (two from N. antarctica forests and 18 from grasslands and
   peatlands). At the stand level, understory values were higher in AR > DR
   > DAR > OGF. Most (81-95\%) plant richness at baseline conditions was
   conserved in all treatments, where inside the aggregates understory
   remained similar to OGF. Combination of aggregated and dispersed
   retention (DAR) better limited exotic species introduction and protected
   sensitive species, improving conservation in harvested stands. Changes
   in understory variables were observed after the first YAH in all
   treatments; greater changes were observed in the harvested areas than in
   aggregates. Changes stabilized at the fourth YAH. As a conclusion, the
   location of retention aggregates should be selected to preserve species
   understory diversity of more speciose and diverse habitats or
   particularly uncommon stands. Implementation of different kinds
   (patterns and levels) of retention for improvement of biodiversity
   conservation in harvested forests should be included in timber and
   forest management planning. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{1. Biodiversity is being lost in our rapidly changing world. Most
   studies that examine biodiversity measure species richness, but loss of
   functional diversity (FD) - defined as the trait variation or dispersion
   in an assemblage - is equally important. FD is useful for management
   actions focused on ecosystem services or functions, especially when
   ecosystem function is ambiguously defined, or there are multiple
   functions of interest. Because FD is often a multivariate measure of
   species differences, it has additional relevance given that we seldom
   have a complete understanding of how traits translate to function.
   2. This Special Profile includes six papers that examine how management
   activities or policy could benefit from consideration of the functional
   contributions of species. When focused on species richness, management
   activities may unintentionally reduce FD, with detrimental consequences
   for ecosystem services or stability. For example, two of the studies
   included in this Special Profile show that grassland management (e.g.
   mowing or grazing) can result in loss of FD, which may result in an
   unintended loss of ecosystem services.
   3. A third paper reviews how species extinction and environmental change
   can negatively affect FD and, potentially, ecosystem function. At the
   individual species level, invasions offer insight into the importance of
   species traits. The fourth paper in this Special Profile describes how
   an invader is successful because of unique trait values, underlining the
   importance of examining FD when considering management options. In
   another paper, eutrophication is shown to drastically affect lichen
   functional groups (some decreasing and some increasing) with a minor
   effect on overall richness. The final paper demonstrates that the
   ability of aquatic plants to maintain biomass production in changing
   environments is determined by their complementary contributions to
   productivity. These complementary contributions to ecosystem function -
   especially given that they are more important in fluctuating
   environments - need to be included in evaluations of diversity.
   4. Synthesis and applications. As FD is increasingly assessed in applied
   studies, it will call into question how we measure diversity and
   evaluate management success. It is clear that species richness cannot be
   the only measure considered. Given that environmental change and
   management activities can reduce FD as well as the number of species,
   management goals and criteria for success need to include FD.}},

   biodiversity and to support the provision of ecosystem services.
   Understanding the long-term potential for recreation success is crucial
   to the evaluation of such schemes.
   2. We use a single-site long-term data set (22 years) to test the
   consequences of grazing recreation management in re-establishing plant
   community composition and functional trait structure as assessed
   relative to pristine examples of target floodplain meadows.
   3. Following a July hay cut, late summer grazing of the re-growth by
   either sheep or cattle resulted in an increase in the similarity of
   plants species composition to the target floodplain meadows, but only in
   terms of what species had colonized, not in terms of their relative
   frequencies.
   4. Where grazing in late summer was applied, the functional traits of
   the meadows undergoing recreation became similar to those of the target
   floodplain meadows only where grazing management was used. When plant
   traits were divided into subcategories (e.g. regeneration, seed biology,
   life-form, environmental associations), only those traits linked with
   plant phenology failed to show evidence of a temporal shift towards the
   functional trait structure of floodplain meadows.
   5. Synthesis and applications: Under typical grazing management
   colonization by the majority of species that characterize the target
   habitat type is predicted to take over 150 years. In contrast,
   recreation of functional trait structure can occur over a considerably
   shorter time-scale (> 70 years). The potential to provide functionally
   equivalent grasslands that deliver analogous ecosystem services to those
   of the target habitat type is therefore a more realistic goal for
   recreation. We suggest that the time-scale needed to recreate grasslands
   puts into question the benefits of compensation schemes that allow
   grasslands to be lost to development (i.e. gravel extraction) in
   exchange for future recreation at other sites.}},

Abstract = {{1. Grassland ecosystems are often used to generate biomass in temperate
   regions of the world. It is well known that biomass is influenced by
   climate and biodiversity, but the relative importance of these two
   factors in relation to management has not been widely studied. To
   recommend management treatments maximizing biomass yields we aim to
   quantify the relative effects of climate species and functional
   diversity on biomass in differently managed grasslands.
   2. We studied the development of biomass yields over the last 37 years
   on a grassland site in Germany, with mowing at five frequencies (one to
   eight times per year), each with and without fertilization. We measured
   plant species richness (SR) and functional richness (FR) (the diversity
   of functional species properties) using presence-absence indices. We
   also measured species evenness (SE), functional evenness and functional
   divergence (FD) using abundance weighted indices. Climate was included
   as the mean temperature and sum of precipitation during the growing
   period. By relating biomass to the above-mentioned climatic and
   biodiversity parameters, we extracted the contribution of these to
   biomass yields.
   3. Biomass changed over time for all treatments and was maximal at
   intermediate mowing frequencies. Temporal changes in biomass were partly
   explained by climate and different aspects of biodiversity, although
   this differed significantly between treatments. The relative importance
   of precipitation was highest at high mowing frequencies; the
   contribution of temperature was highest on less disturbed, unfertilized
   plots. FR and SR influenced biomass changes in the most intensive
   disturbance regimes on unfertilized and fertilized plots respectively.
   FD was most important on intensively disturbed, fertilized plots. SE
   influenced biomass at low mowing frequencies.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Climate, species and functional diversity
   influence annual grassland biomass yields but their importance depends
   on nutrient status and management frequency. Our results indicate that
   management treatments with intermediate disturbance regimes will
   maximize biomass yields in temperate environments. This recommendation
   may become even more important in the context of climate change: at
   intermediate mowing frequencies the influence of climatic variables on
   biomass is less important by comparison to different aspects of
   biodiversity.}},

Abstract = {{Questions: Can we use plant traits to make predictions about ecosystem
   functioning of different species mixtures, identify inherent trade-offs
   of particular species, and design custom communities for desired
   ecosystem functions? Can we develop a methodology to address plant
   trait-functioning relationships in species-level units, which are
   missing from measures of community functional diversity but needed for
   management?
   Location: Grazing lands northeastern USA.
   Method: We measured 53 physiological, morphological and growth traits
   for 19 plant species from glasshouse and field experiments. We developed
   a two-step method to link species to ecosystem processes related to
   management goals of improving desirable forage production in grazing
   lands in northeastern USA.
   Results: Species were distributed continuously, rather than clustering
   into discrete functional types. Grasses, legumes and forbs overlapped
   considerably in trait values with these common classifications failing
   to adequately distinguish functional differences. Factor analyses were
   used to assess variation in species traits, and to rate species for six
   plant processes through which species contribute to the production of
   desirable forage. Species performed well in some processes and poorly in
   others, illustrating complex trade-offs.
   Conclusions: This methodology provides a foundation for developing tools
   to guide construction of communities for applied settings, and for
   assembling hypotheses about plant functioning in mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{Theory predicts that habitat fragmentation, including reduced area and
   connectivity of suitable habitat, changes multitrophic interactions.
   Species at the bottom of trophic cascades (host plants) are expected to
   be less negatively affected than higher trophic levels, such as
   herbivores and their parasitoids or predators. Here we test this
   hypothesis regarding the effects of habitat area and connectivity in a
   trophic system with three levels: first with the population size of the
   larval food plant Hippocrepis comosa, next with the population density
   of the monophagous butterfly species Polyommatus coridon and finally
   with its larval parasitism rate. Our results show no evidence for
   negative effects of habitat fragmentation on the food plant or on
   parasitism rates, but population density of adult P. coridon was reduced
   with decreasing connectivity. We conclude that the highly specialized
   butterfly species is more affected by habitat fragmentation than its
   larval food plant because of its higher trophic position. However, the
   butterfly host species was also more affected than its parasitoids,
   presumably because of lower resource specialization of local parasitoids
   which also frequently occur in alternative hosts. Therefore,
   conservation efforts should focus first on the most specialized species
   of interaction networks and second on higher trophic levels.}},

Abstract = {{The rove beetle Emus hirtus (Linnaeus, 1758) is an endangered habitat
   specialist, which occurs in long-term cattle pastures where it forages
   on cattle dung. We studied this species' historical and recent
   altitudinal distribution and habitat requirements in the centre of its
   distributional range in the Czech Republic. The species had experienced
   a sharp decline and was for nearly 20 years considered as regionally
   extinct within the Czech Republic. Nowadays, Emus hirtus is present and
   occurs in relatively high population densities. However, the beetle has
   shown an uphill shift and is distributed at significantly higher
   altitudes in sun-exposed localities in foothills and mountains compared
   to its historical distribution in the lowlands. Emus hirtus is one of
   many organisms that seem to indicate the openness of the pastured
   woodland landscape in the past. The main reason for its uphill shift
   could be habitat loss in densely populated and intensively managed
   lowlands and restoration of grazing at higher elevations due to

Abstract = {{Wooded pastures with ancient trees were formerly abundant throughout
   Europe, but during the last century, grazing has largely been abandoned
   often resulting in dense forests. Ancient trees constitute habitat for
   many declining and threatened species, but the effects of secondary
   woodland on the biodiversity associated with these trees are largely
   unknown. We tested for difference in species richness, occurrence, and
   abundance of a set of nationally and regionally red-listed epiphytic
   lichens between ancient oaks located in secondary woodland and ancient
   oaks located in open conditions. We refined the test of the effect of
   secondary woodland by also including other explanatory variables.
   Species occurrence and abundance were modelled jointly using
   overdispersed zero-inflated Poisson models. The richness of the
   red-listed lichens on ancient oaks in secondary woodland was half of
   that compared with oaks growing in open conditions. The species-level
   analyses revealed that this was mainly the result of lower occupancy of
   two of the study species. The tree-level abundance of one species was
   also lower in secondary woodland. Potential explanations for this
   pattern are that the study lichens are adapted to desiccating conditions
   enhancing their population persistence by low competition or that open,
   windy conditions enhance their colonisation rate. This means that the
   development of secondary woodland is a threat to red-listed epiphytic
   lichens. We therefore suggest that woody vegetation is cleared and
   grazing resumed in abandoned oak pastures. Importantly, this will also
   benefit the vitality of the oaks.}},

   Horses have an innate capacity to ingest rough forage, which means they
   can efficiently control competitive weeds and keep land cleared. Their
   heterogeneous grazing pattern (as they preserve an area of short grass
   within a wider area of tall grass) promotes, at least on a temporary
   basis, the coexistence of a wide number of plant and animal species
   within the vegetation cover. Their diet includes fewer dicotyledons than

Abstract = {{We studied the impact of seed mixtures (grass-clover, less competitive
   grass vs. meadow plant mixture) and mowing (annual mowing vs. no mowing)
   on the abundance of seed and insect food for farmland birds in set-aside
   in a long-term field experiment. In general, seed food was less affected
   by the treatments than insect food. The impact of seed mixture on the
   abundance of seed food was dependent on the study year: the highest
   level recorded in the first year, followed by a substantial decline in
   the following years. Mowing increased the biomass of seed food. The
   impact of treatments on insect food abundance differed between the total
   amount of insect food, and had significant interactions with year.
   Different insect groups dominated in each year as well as their response
   to the treatments. For the total amount, the meadow plant seed mixture
   appeared to be the most beneficial and a slight positive impact of
   mowing appeared in the last two years of the experiment. The results
   suggest that the value of set-asides in providing food differs according
   to food components and declines with increasing age of the set-aside.

Abstract = {{Context The roles of woody-plant islands are well documented in
   low-altitude regions, but research related to such shrub effects in
   high-altitude regions is scant.
   Aims Four common shrub species (Cerasus trichostoma, Ribes glaciale,
   Rosa omeiensis and Salix sphaeronymphe) in a high-altitude forest
   cutover of the eastern Tibetan Plateau, were chosen to evaluate the
   effects of both species and size of shrub islands on microhabitats,
   herbaceous communities and woody seedling regeneration.
   Methods Total 86 shrubs with different sizes were investigated; The
   shrub size, herb community structure and species composition, litter,
   soil nutrient and microclimate parameters beneath the shrub canopies
   were also measured.
   Results All shrubs significantly ameliorated microclimates, increased
   content of soil organic matter and total nitrogen, both grass and forb
   species richness, and litter cover and biomass, and promoted woody
   seedling recruitment (richness and number), but decreased cover and
   biomass of the herbaceous community beneath them. These effects were
   greater for larger shrubs, and also varied among shrub species with
   different crown architectures. We also found differences in
   species-dependency of the shrub effect for the responses of the
   herbaceous and woody seedling species, suggesting that shrubs also
   indirectly facilitate forbs and seedling regeneration through
   competition release of grasses. We conclude that shrub-island effects
   are size-and species-dependent. In order to accelerate natural
   succession and restoration in alpine cutovers, shrub island preservation
   and their effective utilization as reforestation microhabitats should be
   integrated into vegetation management procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The plateau pika is a keystone species of Qinghai-Tibet plateau, but its
   overabundance aggravates the degradation of alpine meadow. Grazing is
   the most convenient manner to utilize alpine meadow. Grazing would
   change vegetation condition, that is, change the habitat of plateau pika
   and so lead to variation of plateau pika population. Based on ecological
   characteristics of plateau pika and alpine meadow, a cellular-automata
   model is established to investigate the influence of grazing on dynamics
   of plateau pika population. Vegetation shortens with the increase of
   grazing intensity. When grazing intensity is light, the height of
   vegetation under summer grazing, continuous grazing, rotational grazing
   and winter grazing decrease in turn. The ACC (average carrying capacity
   of plateau pika) is higher on degraded meadow and is lower on undegraded
   meadow. On undegraded meadow grazing affects the value of ACC, whereas,
   on degraded meadow grazing has slight effect on it. On undegraded
   meadow, plateau pika occupies all cells speedly, the amount of damaged
   cells and the average amount of live holes in occupied cells decrease or
   hold the line on temporal dimension. On degraded meadow, the dispersal
   of plateau pika is restrained, the amount of damaged cells and the
   average amount of live holes in occupied cells increase on temporal

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{4}},

Pages = {{157-168}},

Abstract = {{Aims
   We used a 10-year field experiment that consisted of mowing and
   fertilizer treatments to evaluate the role of niche limitation in
   seedling establishment of species from different functional groups and
   of varying local abundance in an old field undergoing succession.
   Methods
   Seedlings of nine different species were planted into a successional
   field subjected to mowing and fertilizer treatments for 10 years that
   resulted in different plant communities and resource availability.
   Species representative of the factorial combination of three functional
   groups (C-4 grasses, C-3 grasses and legumes) and three abundance
   categories (abundant, present, or absent in the old field) were planted
   in four treatments resulting from the factorial combination of annual
   spring mowing (mowed and unmowed) and fertilizer application (annually
   fertilized and unfertilized). Survivorship, relative growth rate (RGR)
   and biomass were measured to determine the role of niche limitation on
   recruitment and growth.
   Important Findings
   Mowing increased the establishment success of seedlings. Fertilization
   had little influence on seedling performance and survivorship. C-3
   grasses had the highest survivorship, while C-4 grasses and legumes had
   equivalent RGRs, but higher than C-3 grasses. By contrast, survivorship
   of legumes was unrelated to mowing or fertilizer, suggesting that
   establishment of this functional group was dependent on other,
   unmeasured conditions or processes. Species already present, but at low
   abundance, performed better than locally abundant or absent species.
   Propagule limitation may restrict the arrival of a species. However,
   recruitment and establishment was subject to niche limitation, which
   varied among species, functional groups and whether a species is already
   resident at the site and its abundance. Thus, species interactions
   restrict establishment during old-field succession, supporting the niche
   limitation hypothesis.}},

Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Government policies relating to red meat production take account of the
   carbon footprint, environmental impact, and contributions to human
   health and nutrition, biodiversity and food security. This paper reviews
   the impact of grazing on these parameters and their interactions,
   identifying those practices that best meet governments' strategic goals.
   The recent focus of research on livestock grazing and biodiversity has
   been on reducing grazing intensity on hill and upland areas. Although
   this produces rapid increases in sward height and herbage mass, changes
   in structural diversity and plant species are slower, with no
   appreciable short-term increases in biodiversity so that environmental
   policies that simply involve reductions in numbers of livestock may not
   result in increased biodiversity. Furthermore, upland areas rely heavily
   on nutrient inputs to pastures so that withdrawal of these inputs can
   threaten food security. Differences in grazing patterns among breeds
   increase our ability to manage biodiversity if they are matched
   appropriately to different conservation grazing goals. Lowland grassland
   systems differ from upland pastures in that additional nutrients in the
   form of organic and inorganic fertilisers are more frequently applied to
   lowland pastures. Appropriate management of these nutrient applications
   is required, to reduce the associated environmental impact. New
   slurry-spreading techniques and technologies (e. g. the trailing shoe)
   help reduce nutrient losses but high nitrogen losses from urine
   deposition remain a key issue for lowland grassland systems.
   Nitrification inhibitors have the greatest potential to successfully
   tackle this problem. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are lower from
   indoor-based systems that use concentrates to shorten finishing periods.
   The challenge is to achieve the same level of performance from
   grass-based systems. Research has shown potential solutions through the
   use of forages containing condensed tannins or establishing swards with
   a high proportion of clover and high-sugar grasses. Relative to feeding
   conserved forage or concentrates, grazing fresh grass not only reduces
   GHG emissions but also enhances the fatty acid composition of meat in
   terms of consumer health. It is possible to influence biodiversity,
   nutrient utilisation, GHG emissions and the nutritional quality of meat
   in grass-based systems, but each of these parameters is intrinsically
   linked and should not be considered in isolation. Interactions between
   these parameters must be considered carefully when policies are being
   developed, in order to ensure that strategies designed to achieve
   positive gains in one category do not lead to a negative impact in
   another. Some win-win outcomes are identified.}},

Title = {{Differential facilitative and competitive effects of a dominant

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{1. Plant-plant interactions fluctuate between competition and
   facilitation depending upon ecological conditions and species traits.
   Facilitative interactions are expected to increase in frequency via
   associational defences with increasing consumer pressure. The ability of
   species to cope with competition and/or ecological stressors may alter
   the outcome of plant-plant interactions.
   2. We conducted a transplant experiment to determine if native and
   non-native grasses and forbs respond similarly to interactions with
   Juncus effusus L., an unpalatable benefactor species, along a grazing
   intensity gradient in two contrasting pasture types: intensively managed
   and semi-natural. We expected competitive taller, erect species
   (grasses) and non-natives to obtain stronger facilitative effects than
   shorter, sprawling species (forbs) and natives.
   3. We transplanted two species each of grasses and forbs, including one
   native and one non-native species of each, into 1-m(2) grazed plots or
   exclosure plots either with or without Juncus in wetlands experiencing a
   range of grazing intensities across the two pasture types.
   4. Interactions with Juncus varied from facilitation in grazed plots to
   competition in exclosures for the two grasses and the non-native forb.
   Juncus did not facilitate the native forb in grazed conditions. Grazing
   negatively influenced all species. For the grasses, facilitation
   intensity increased as grazing intensity increased, while facilitation
   intensity for forbs was unrelated to grazing intensity.
   5. Synthesis. Facilitation intensity of a dominant macrophyte increased
   with consumer pressure for tall grasses in productive subtropical
   wetlands. These findings suggest that facilitation can allow native and
   non-native species to pass through human-induced ecological filters,
   such as cattle grazing, with implications for understanding forces
   governing community composition in disturbed environments.}},

Title = {{Atmospheric nitrogen deposition explains patterns of plant species loss}},
Journal = {{GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2882-2892}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition across Europe increased
   substantially from the 1950s to the 1990s. Targeted surveys suggest a
   negative correlation between N deposition and species richness within
   quadrats in sensitive habitats. However, it remains unclear whether
   plant species losses at national recording scales are correlated with
   nitrogen deposition. We relate plant species losses before 1987 in Great
   Britain to reduced and oxidized N deposition, land use change and
   climate change. The mean Ellenberg fertility (N) indices of plant
   species lost in each 100 km(2) cell before 1987 was compared with those
   of species that were recorded between 1987 and 1999. In 45\% of squares,
   indices of species lost were significantly lower than those for species
   present after 1986. For 17\%, primarily upland, squares, the opposite
   effect was found. A generalized least squares regression model, with
   difference in the mean Ellenberg N index between samples as the
   dependent variable, showed that higher deposition of reduced N was
   significantly associated with selective loss of species with a lower
   index. Arable land use and change in arable land use also demonstrated
   this positive relationship. Rough grazing, change in rough grazing,
   change in pasture and change in annual precipitation showed negative
   effects. Difference in Ellenberg R index was highly correlated with
   difference in Ellenberg N and was negatively correlated with oxidized N
   deposition, suggesting that the lack of a significant effect of oxidized
   N deposition on Ellenberg N was because it had effects through both
   acidification and eutrophication, while the effect of reduced N
   deposition was primarily through eutrophication. Our results suggest
   that N deposition, along with land use and precipitation changes, has
   been a significant driver of local plant extinctions. With N deposition
   increasing in many parts of the world, local extinctions of plant
   species may be experienced in other regions.}},

Volume = {{66}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{333-336}},

Abstract = {{In Maqu County, Gansu Province, China, there are two types of grazing
   management. Under multi-household (MH) management, grassland is jointly
   managed by two or more households without fences between pastures. Under
   single-household (SH) management, fenced-off parcels of grassland are
   used. SH management was imposed in the belief that it would alleviate
   grassland degradation. Comparable land parcels with similar stocking
   rates subject to MH and SH management were identified and surveyed to
   determine the species present and species density (m(-2)). MH land had
   greater number values than SH but the differences were not significant.
   A further analysis indicated that the number of households using MH land
   influenced species richness. There was also evidence to suggest that the
   quality of the forage available deteriorated under SH management. It was
   concluded that MH grazing resulted in greater species richness than SH
   and is perhaps an important contributor to biodiversity conservation and
   grassland management for the region.}},

Abstract = {{Mammalian herbivores can have dramatic effects on the vegetation through
   different mechanisms, and may therefore modify resource distribution or
   create habitat for other species. Organisms that cause such changes are
   classified as ecosystem engineers. The European rabbit (Oryctolagus
   cuniculus) is a semi-fossorial mammal native to the Iberian Peninsula
   and a keystone species in Mediterranean foodwebs. Rabbits are
   central-place foragers, but few studies have analysed their ecosystem
   engineering effects in the vicinity of warrens. Here, we explored the
   role of rabbits as ecosystem engineers in Mediterranean pastures in
   central Spain. We studied the spatial patterns and internal
   heterogeneity in the vegetation community of different spatial subunits
   created by rabbits (warrens, the warren influence area, and latrines).
   Within the different subunits, rabbit activities gave rise to patches
   and gradients with different plant species richness, diversity and
   height, and a high internal heterogeneity (dissimilarity) in floristic
   composition. Through different mechanisms, they have a significant
   effect on species coexistence and competitive interactions, and increase
   the number of available niches for plants which otherwise would not be
   able to establish. In conclusion, rabbits can act as allogenic ecosystem
   engineers in Mediterranean pastures, increasing heterogeneity and
   contributing to the high biodiversity of Mediterranean annual pastures.

Volume = {{167}},

Pages = {{209-218}},

Abstract = {{Understanding how communities assemble is a key challenge in ecology.
   Conflicting hypotheses suggest that plant traits within communities
   should show divergence to reflect strategies to reduce competition or
   convergence to reflect strong selection for the environmental conditions
   operating. Further hypotheses suggest that plant traits related to
   productivity show convergence within communities, but those related to
   disturbance show divergence. Data on functional diversity (FDvar) of 12
   traits from 30 communities ranging from arable fields, mown and grazed
   grasslands to moorland and woodland were employed to test this using
   randomisations tests and correlation and regression analysis. No traits
   showed consistent significant convergence or divergence in functional
   diversity. When correlated to measures of the environment, the most
   common pattern was for functional diversity to decline (7 out of 12
   traits) and the degree of convergence (7 out of 12 traits) to increase
   as the levels of productivity (measured as primary productivity, soil
   nitrogen release and vegetation C:N) and disturbance increased.
   Convergence or a relationship between functional diversity and the
   environment was not seen for a number of important traits, such as LDMC
   and SLA, which are considered as key predictors of ecosystem function.
   The analysis indicates that taking into account functional diversity
   within a system may be a necessary part of predicting the relationship
   between plant traits and ecosystem function, and that this may be of
   particular importance within less productive and less disturbed systems.}},

Abstract = {{Functional redundancy predicts that some species may play equivalent
   roles in ecosystem functioning therefore conferring a kind of
   `insurance' to perturbation when species richness is reduced, by the
   compensation of species of the same functional group on ecosystem
   processes. We evaluate functional redundancy on grassland plant
   communities by a removal experiment in which the evaluated treatments
   were: GG - clipping two graminoid species, FF - clipping two forb
   species, GF - clipping one graminoid and one forb species and Control -
   no removal. We tested the hypothesis that the above-ground biomass
   removal of one species of each functional group would cause less change
   in the community composition (community persistence) and less decrease
   in biomass production than the above-ground biomass removal of two
   species of the same functional group. Functional redundancy was
   corroborated for community persistence since treatments FG and C caused
   less change in community composition than treatments GG and FF, although
   no differences were found between treatments for above-ground biomass.
   We verified that clipped species tend to be compensated by an increase
   in the percent cover of the remaining species of the same functional
   group. This work provides experimental evidence of early responses after
   plant clipping in small spatial scale of functional redundancy in
   naturally established grassland plant communities. We highlight
   redundancy as an intrinsic feature of communities insuring their
   reliability, as a consequence of species compensation within functional
   groups.}},

Abstract = {{A common perception, particularly in South Africa, is that heavily and
   continuously grazed communal land leads to degradation and loss of plant
   diversity when compared to commercial rangeland farming or conservation
   areas. We focus on whether this applies to the Grassland Biome of South
   Africa and whether the opposite can occur, namely, an increase in plant
   species richness under heavy grazing. A study of a contrast between a
   communal area of the former Ciskei and a neighbouring nature reserve
   showed that intense utilization under communal use led to a significant
   increase in plant species richness. However, this increase was
   scale-dependent with the greatest significant difference occurring at
   sample plot scale (50 m(2)) but converging at the broader scale of the
   whole study site. Species that increased with heavy grazing included
   those from arid Karroid areas as well as some from more mesic grassland
   and savanna areas. The contribution of beta diversity to gamma diversity
   across the grazing contrast was relatively low which reflects the
   relatively high proportion of species shared between treatments. Total
   plant canopy cover declined sharply with heavy grazing. In terms of
   plant canopy cover, grazing favoured annual over perennial plants,
   prostrate over erect plants, and stoloniferous over tussock plant
   architecture. This pattern was not supported when expressed in terms of
   number of species belonging to these grazing response groups or traits.}},

Journal = {{PLANT ECOLOGY}},

Volume = {{212}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1563-1576}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Low-intensive grazing is a widely used management tool to conserve the
   outstanding biodiversity of calcareous grasslands. As conservation
   management is cost-intensive and often hampered by limited financial
   resources, combining adequate management for biodiversity conservation
   with feasible livestock production may be relevant for both
   conservationists and land managers. However, profound knowledge of the
   effect of grazing in non-intensively used grasslands on seasonal
   variation in biomass quality is scarce. We analyzed the floristic
   composition, abiotic soil properties and the chemical composition of
   aboveground biomass in a grazed calcareous grassland in NW Germany.
   Sampling took place in monthly intervals during one growing season. To
   separate the impact of grazing and non-grazing on biomass quality, an
   exclosure experiment was performed. Floristic composition of the studied
   calcareous grasslands was mainly related to two gradients representing
   the trophic status and the long-term management intensity. Differences
   in abiotic site conditions were hardly reflected by nutrient
   concentrations in the biomass. Irrespectively of abiotic site
   conditions, the chemical composition of the biomass showed a clear
   seasonal trend. Nutrient concentrations strongly declined from May to
   July but increased again in August, probably because of favourable
   current-year weather conditions. Sheep grazing improved biomass quality
   indicating that grazing modifies the environment beneficially for the
   animals. We conclude that early spring and late summer grazing is an
   appropriate management scheme to balance requirements of both feasible
   livestock production and biodiversity conservation, which is promising
   for sustainable and long-term conservation management.}},

Abstract = {{Land-use and land-cover change are important drivers of global
   environmental change, affecting the state of biodiversity, the global
   carbon cycle, and other aspects of the earth system. In this article we
   describe the development of the land-use model LandSHIFT, which aims to
   simulate land-use and land-cover change on the continental and global
   scale. The model is based on a ``land-use systems{''} approach, which
   describes the interplay between anthropogenic and environmental system
   components as drivers of land-use change. LandSHIFT's modular structure
   facilitates the integration of different components that cover key parts
   of land-use systems. The model prototype combines a module for the
   simulation of land-use change dynamics with a module for calculating
   crop yields and net primary productivity of grassland. LandSHIFT is
   driven by country-level model inputs including time-series of
   socio-economic variables as well as agricultural production data. This
   information is regionalized to land-use grid maps with a cell size of 5
   arc-minutes. Here, the model clearly differentiates between the land-use
   activities settlement, crop cultivation and grazing. By using
   standardized input-output formats, LandSHIFT can be combined with other
   models for conducting complex simulation studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Recently, there has been increasing concern about the value of
   semi-natural pasture for maintaining biodiversity. However, because of a
   lack of agro-ecological assessments, farmers still believe that
   semi-natural pasture is less productive than ``improved{''} pasture
   dominated by exotic pasture grasses. To develop a compromise solution
   that ensures both productivity and biodiversity conservation in
   agro-pastoral ecosystems, we compared the degree of grazing optimization
   and diversity enhancement by grazing between improved and semi-natural
   pastures in temperate Japan. We analyzed the responses of plant growth
   and biodiversity to clipping treatments (maintaining sward heights of 5
   or 15 cm) that simulated grazing. Aboveground productivity was
   stimulated by clipping treatment on both improved and semi-natural
   pastures (a 2- and 1.5-fold increase, respectively), indicating that
   both pasture types can be productive from an agricultural perspective.
   Although species richness was not influenced by clipping treatment or
   pasture type, the semi-natural pasture contained more species (34 vs.
   20) than the improved pasture, thus demonstrating the value of
   semi-natural pasture for creating a potentially biologically diverse
   habitat. Our results thus offer some empirical evidence for farmers and
   agroecologists to support the utility of semi-natural pasture as an
   alternative sustainable grazing system from both agricultural and
   biodiversity conservation perspectives. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The role of clonal traits in a plant's response to changes in management
   of semi-natural grasslands is poorly known and the few studies examining
   their importance have yielded contradictory results. For a better
   understanding of the role of plant functional traits in determining
   competitive ability and clonal growth in response to early changes in
   management, we mowed and applied fertilizer to 22 wet meadows in the
   Zelezne hory Mts, Czech Republic. We used two methods of assessing
   abundance (plant cover and species frequency) to determine whether
   changes in frequency induced by changes in management are better
   predicted by clonal traits while changes in cover are mainly determined
   by competitive traits such as plant height. We evaluated (i) the
   response of individual species to changes in management and (ii) the
   response of the whole community, with and without taking abundance of
   individual plants into account, in order to separate the effect of local
   extinction and immigration from changes in abundance. The plant
   functional traits tested were generally found to be important soon after
   the changes in the management of the semi-natural grasslands occurred:
   competitively superior resident species (possessing tall erosulate,
   monocyclic shoots) that are able to spread far and multiply clonally
   (having a high clonal index) were favoured by applying fertilizer and/or
   suppressed by mowing. Some other traits supposed to be important in the
   response to changes in management did not change (persistence of
   connection between ramets). Results for the two methods of assessing
   abundance differed; however, neither was better at detecting the
   response of particular types of traits (i.e. relevant to clonal growth
   and competitive ability). The initial response of the whole community,
   with and without taking abundance of individual plants into account, was
   consistent indicating that species that went extinct possessed the same
   traits as those that decreased in abundance. The clonal index proved to
   be a useful characteristic of meadow plants. Our results further imply
   that (i) the method used to assess abundance significantly affects the
   out-put of analyses of the response of functional traits, and (ii) a
   comparison of analyses based on weighting abundance and unweighted means
   resulted in a deeper insight into the changes in the spectra of
   functional traits that occurred after changes in meadow management.}},

Abstract = {{The dry grasslands of La Crau, a pseudo-steppe ecosystem located in
   Southern France, have experienced drastic reduction and degradation due
   to intensive agricultural activities for the past 50 years, leading to
   changes in their beetle assemblage. This valuable ecosystem is
   characterized by 50\% stone cover, consisting of remnants from an old
   riverbed, and centuries-old sheep grazing. However, much of the stone
   cover has been removed for the purposes of cultivation. With the aim of
   restoring this ecosystem, we manipulated these two principal ecological
   factors: sheep grazing (grazing/exclusion) and stone cover (50\% stone
   cover/no large stones). This study was conducted on a former cultivated
   field and on a pseudo-steppe area. On each of the two areas, 12
   experimental units contained four different treatment patches: (1)
   stones x grazing, (2) no stones x grazing, (3) no stones x no grazing
   and (4) stones x no grazing, were randomly positioned. Data were
   obtained from 96 pitfall traps (one on each patch). After 4 years,
   restored stone cover combined with grazing exclusion significantly
   improved beetle abundance and increased beetle richness (38 species vs.
   22 in the grazed-no-stones treatment), whereas no significant
   differences were recorded in the three other treatments. Our results
   therefore suggest that removing grazing for a few years and restoring
   stone cover is a promising method to restore beetle assemblages in this
   type of ecosystem.}},

Journal = {{AQUATIC BOTANY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{95}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{140-145}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In California, much of the remaining vernal pool habitat is used for
   cattle grazing. Some studies suggest that grazing helps promote native
   plant diversity on grasslands, but the impact of grazing on plants that
   reside in pool basins is largely unknown. We investigated how one aspect
   of cattle grazing, the deposition of waste, affects these plant species
   by adding dung and urine to mesocosms lined with vernal pool soil. As a
   result of dung input, orthophosphate, conductivity, and turbidity
   increased in our mesocosms while dissolved oxygen decreased. Such
   changes in water quality are consistent with a shift toward a eutrophic
   state. Algal biomass and percent-cover also increased in dung-treated
   mesocosms. When the mesocosms dried, vascular plant species richness and
   percent-cover in dung-treated mesocosms were reduced by up to 54\% and
   87\%, respectively. We attribute this to light attenuation by algal mats
   that flourished in the nutrient-enriched water. We also found that dung
   input caused significant, but weak, shifts in the composition of the
   vascular plant community. We conclude that cattle grazing may be
   detrimental to plant communities in vernal pools via increased nutrient
   loading, which promotes algal growth. Any beneficial effects of grazing
   may thus be limited to the surrounding grassland. Studies that examine
   the regional-scale impacts of grazing on vernal pool grasslands should
   separately consider the impacts to local-scale (i.e., within-pool) plant
   diversity, as most of the threatened and endangered plant species of
   California vernal pools reside primarily in pool basins. (c) 2011

Abstract = {{Livestock grazing is an important management tool of agri-environment
   schemes initiated within the European Union to maintain and restore
   biodiversity of grassland birds. However, grazing can affect bird
   populations negatively by depressing reproduction through nest trampling
   and increasing nest predation. These effects are, however, considered
   low when using recommended stocking rates. By simulating wader nests, we
   experimentally quantify and examine the causes of variation in trampling
   rates on managed Baltic coastal meadows. Secondly, we examine whether
   livestock presence increases nest predation of one management target,
   the critically endangered southern dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii).
   Trampling rates of experimental nests were high. Only 21\% of nests
   would have survived a three week incubating period early in the grazing
   season. Trampling rates were most severe at the onset of grazing and
   decreased with time. Thus, timing of grazing plays a crucial role in
   determining breeding success on managed meadows. Predation rates of
   dunlin nests were moderate and did not depend on livestock presence
   suggesting that incubating dunlin are not disturbed by cattle. While
   grazing is vital in habitat restoration and in conserving grassland
   biodiversity, our results suggest that grazing may also threaten the
   viability of populations if negative effects are underestimated.
   Therefore, management plans, especially for endangered species, should
   not only rely on general recommendations on stocking rates but instead
   planners need to evaluate the significance of negative effects in terms
   of local conditions (timing of breeding and grazing, space use of cattle
   and birds, measured trampling rates) and adjust grazing practises
   accordingly.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated relationships between richness patterns of rare and
   common grassland species and environmental factors, focussing on
   comparing the degree to which the richness patterns of rare and common
   species are determined by simple environmental variables. Using data
   collected in the Machair grassland of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, we
   fitted spatial regression models using a suite of grazing, soil
   physicochemical and microtopographic covariates, to nested
   sub-assemblages of vascular and non-vascular species ranked according to
   rarity. As expected, we found that common species drive richness
   patterns, but rare vascular species had significantly stronger affinity
   for high richness areas. After correcting for the prevalence of
   individual species distributions, we found differences between common
   and rare species in 1) the amount of variation explained: richness
   patterns of common species were better summarised by simple
   environmental variables, 2) the associations of environmental variables
   with richness showed systematic trends between common and rare species
   with coefficient sign reversal for several factors, and 3) richness
   associations with rare environments: richness patterns of rare vascular
   species significantly matched rare environments but those of
   non-vascular species did not. Richness patterns of rare species, at
   least in this system, may be intrinsically less predictable than those
   of common species.}},

Abstract = {{The interrelationship of soil and vegetation degradation is an emerging
   issue, where most studies have addressed severe degradation so far. We
   aimed at revealing changes in soil accompanying slight vegetation
   degradation in a case study involving xeromesophilous grasslands from
   Hungary. Slight degradation is of special interest here because the
   target community (Euphorbio pannonicae-Brachypodietum pinnati
   association) has great nature conservation value. Vegetation status was
   related to chemical and structural soil properties by principal
   component analysis and redundancy analysis. Vegetation conditions were
   assessed by species abundances and by fine-scale spatial structure,
   which is proposed here for soil-vegetation studies. Slight vegetation
   degradation clearly manifested itself in soil properties. Differences in
   vegetation status when assessed by species abundances were mirrored in
   chemical soil properties. When structural vegetation descriptors were
   used, a soil structure property (bulk density) was responsible for the
   segregation according to naturalness. Vegetation-soil relationships were
   more consistent over biogeographic regions, when vegetation structural
   descriptors were used. Differences in chemical soil properties reflected
   species abundance pattern, as was found in most non-grazing related
   degradation studies. However, changes to soil structure also accompanied
   slight degradation, and their importance was revealed when vegetation
   structure was taken into account.}},

Abstract = {{The little bustard Tetrax tetrax has undergone severe range contraction
   within Europe due to abandonment of traditional agro-pastoral
   activities. Previous studies of habitat selection have mainly focused on
   extensive cereal and cropland mosaics, while the species' ecology in
   pastoral landscapes is understood less well, and data are completely
   lacking from the Sardinian population. We conducted distance sampling
   surveys of displaying males across three contrasting landscapes in
   Sardinia and modelled habitat preference at both the landscape and local
   (within pastures and recent fallows) scale. Abbasanta, with a balance of
   pasture and cropland, the greatest isolation from roads and shortest
   vegetation, supported the highest little bustard densities (95\%CI
   2.7-3.4 males/100 ha). Significantly lower densities were found in two
   landscapes with lower isolation from roads and taller vegetation within
   grasslands: Campeda (0.1-0.2 males/100 ha), comprising cropland and
   pasture in similar proportions to those found at Abbasanta, and
   Campidano (0.3-0.4 males/100 ha) that was dominated by cereal
   agriculture. At the landscape level, males preferred pastures and recent
   fallows over arable lands. At the local scale, within grasslands,
   probability of occurrence was greater with shorter vegetation, more
   legume and green herb cover and at points remote from roads. Shorter
   vegetation in grasslands resulted from high grazing pressure, and
   habitat suitability for breeding males depends strongly on extensively
   grazed grasslands. Conservation efforts for this species should focus on
   maintaining traditional agro-pastoral practices which maintain large
   areas of extensively grazed pastures and recent fallows located far from
   roads.}},

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Extensive grasslands are considered to be of high biodiversity value,
   but are under threat from intensification and abandonment. We studied
   butterfly species richness and abundance in 47 hay and grazing meadows
   in the Picos de Europa, northern Spain in 2004. Nine transects were
   walked around the perimeter of the meadows from the 1 June to 28 July
   with butterflies recorded to species or species-group. Land-use,
   abiotic, and sward variables were also recorded. Change in meadow extent
   was estimated by comparing a digital map of open meadows with a
   cadastral map with 1950s provenance. We found: A decrease in open area,
   mostly attributable to reduction in grazing meadows. 75 or more
   butterfly species with species richness principally, and positively,
   influenced by altitude and presence of scrub in the body of the meadow.
   Hay meadow management was a positive influence on richness of satyrids.
   When all butterflies were considered together, the only significant
   factor influencing abundance was Plantago lanceolata (-ve). For
   sub-groups of the butterfly community there was no consistent pattern,
   although P. lanceolata was identified as a (-ve) factor in relation to
   hesperiid, nymphalid, satyrid, and Viola-feeding fritillary groups.
   Several regression models included components that could be linked to
   abiotic influences (water, aspect, altitude) but many were indicative of
   abandonment or relaxation of management intensity (scrub, Pteridium
   aquilinum, Asphodelus albus), sward components, fragmentation (distance
   to nearest meadow, number of meadows within 100 m), and land use (hay
   management, summer grazing). The results are discussed in relation to
   changing socio-economics, including the potential impact of tourism, and
   the need for financial instruments to support extensive farming.}},

Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1697-1704}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The relationship between decomposer diversity and ecosystem functioning
   is little understood although soils accommodate a significant proportion
   of worldwide biodiversity. Collembola are among the most abundant and
   diverse decomposers and are known to modify plant growth. We examined
   the effects of Collembola species diversity (one, two and three species
   belonging to different life history groups) and composition on litter
   decomposition and the performance of plant communities (above- and
   below-ground productivity) of different functional groups (grasses,
   forbs and legumes). Collembola densities did not increase with diversity
   indicating niche overlap. Generally, Collembola species composition was
   a better predictor for ecosystem functioning than Collembola species
   number with the impacts of Collembola diversity and composition on
   ecosystem functioning strongly depending on plant functional group
   identity. Non-linear effects of Collembola diversity on litter
   decomposition and plant productivity suggest pronounced and context
   dependent species interactions and feeding habits. Net surface litter
   decomposition was decreased by Collembola, whereas root litter
   decomposition was at maximum in the highest Collembola diversity
   treatment. Forbs benefitted most from the presence of three Collembola
   species. Similarly, Collembola diversity influenced root depth
   distribution in a plant functional group specific way: while grass root
   biomass decreased with increasing Collembola diversity in the upper and
   lower soil layer, legume root biomass increased particularly in the
   lower soil layer. Idiosyncratic and context dependent effects of
   Collembola diversity and composition even in rather simple assemblages
   of one to three species suggest that changes in Collembola diversity may
   have unpredictable consequences for ecosystem functioning. The finding
   that changes in Collembola performance did not directly translate to
   alterations in ecosystem functioning indicates that response traits do
   pot necessarily conform to effect traits. Distinct plant functional
   group specific impacts of Collembola diversity on root depth
   distribution are likely to modify plant competition in complex plant
   communities and add a novel mechanism how decomposers may affect plant
   community assembly. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{The performance of native and non-native turfgrass monocultures and
   native turfgrass polycultures: An ecological approach to sustainable
   lawns}},

Abstract = {{As environmental impacts and life-cycle costs (water use, water,
   fertilizer, pesticides and mowing) of the constructed landscape come
   under increasing scrutiny, the development of methods to reduce resource
   inputs for managed turf are increasingly important. While the use of a
   number of native turfgrass species as alternatives to non-natives has
   been previously examined, only a few are presently commercially
   available, and many species have been perceived as failing to perform to
   the level required by industry and consumers. Furthermore, the use of
   polycultures of native turfgrasses has not been extensively
   investigated, but could offer an alternative to the conventional lawn.
   We hypothesize that because native short grass species would be expected
   to be well-adapted to climate and soil conditions in areas with
   infrequent and erratic rainfall, their performance in terms of drought
   resistance, resilience to disturbance, and efficient resource use, will
   exceed that of a non-native species. Moreover, ecological theory
   predicts that a polyculture of coexisting native species may exhibit
   additional performance benefits. One native (Bouteloua dactyloides) and
   one commonly-used, non-native monoculture (Cynodon dactylon) and two
   native polyculture assemblages (two and seven species including B.
   dactyloides, Bouteloua gracilis, Bouteloua rigidiseta, Hilaria
   belangeri, Erioneuron pilosum, Bouteloua hirsuta, Sporobolus
   vaginiflorus) were compared for leaf density and weed resistance under
   two irrigation regimens, traffic regimes and mowing intensities. The
   native turfgrass and turfgrass assemblages generally had 30\% higher
   leaf densities in the early growing season, and up to 50\% lower weed
   density than the non-native monoculture. There was no difference among
   species tested in response to traffic or irrigation regimens, suggesting
   that all assemblages could be subjected to both higher traffic
   frequencies and reduced water inputs. Even though native species can
   have slower growth rates compared to the non-native species they
   maintained a higher or equivalent leaf density than the non-native
   turfgrass. This is a potentially important finding because of the large
   impact that mowing has on the total carbon footprint of turfgrass, and
   the corresponding reduction in that carbon footprint that could be
   realized through a reduced mowing frequency and corresponding reduction
   in life-cycle cost. This study suggests that regionally adapted native
   grass species are worth investigating as mono- and polycultures for
   performance advantages and lower resource inputs, and consequently may
   be suitable alternatives to conventional non-native turfgrasses in many
   applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To review the recent research into human-mediated dispersal
   (HMD) in the European rural landscape, and explore the potential
   positive aspect of HMD for grassland conservation, in contrast to it's
   common association with the spread of invasive species.
   Methods: A literature search was undertaken to identify HMD vectors in
   the rural landscape for discussion regarding dispersal potential past
   and present, implications for management, and the identification of
   future research needs.
   Results: Grazing animals are important propagule dispersers, but the
   reduced movement of livestock through the landscape has also meant a
   reduction in seeds dispersed in this way. Other, non-standard
   human-mediated dispersal vectors such as clothing and motor vehicles can
   also transport seeds of many species, and HMD vectors often transport
   seeds with a variety of dispersal specialisations.
   Recommendations: There should be a greater movement of grazing animals
   throughout the landscape, either within larger grazing areas or between
   existing grasslands. Where this is not possible, other, more directed
   dispersal of propagules from species-rich communities to target sites
   should be considered. The potential of non-standard HMD vectors to make
   a positive contribution to biodiversity should be considered, but more
   research into all types of HMD vectors is important if we are to fully
   understand their role in the dispersal of plant species in fragmented
   landscapes.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Can managing disturbance regimes alone or in combination with
   seeding native species serve to shift the balance from exotic towards
   native species?
   Location: Central coast of California, USA.
   Methods: We measured vegetation composition for 10 yr in a manipulative
   experiment replicated at three sites. Treatments included no
   disturbance, grazing and clipping at three frequencies with and without
   litter removal. We seeded eight native species into clipped plots and
   compared cover in comparable plots with no seeding.
   Results: Regardless of frequency, clipping generally shifted community
   dominance from exotic annual grasses to exotic annual forbs, rather than
   consistently favoring native species. At one site, perennial grass cover
   decreased in no-disturbance plots, but only after 4 yr. Litter removal
   had minimal impact on litter depth and plant community composition.
   Grazing had a highly variable effect on the abundance of different plant
   guilds across sites and years. Seeding increased abundance of only two
   of eight native species.
   Conclusions: Managing disturbance regimes alone is insufficient to
   restore native species guilds in highly-invaded grasslands and seeding
   native species has highly variable success.}},

Title = {{Experimental reduction of native vertebrate grazing and addition of logs
   benefit beetle diversity at multiple scales}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{1. High densities of vertebrate herbivores can be a significant barrier
   to ecological restoration in many parts of the world because of their
   impact on vegetation biomass. A common method for managing vertebrate
   herbivores is the use of exclosure fences, but very few studies have
   examined how small-scale structural refugia (e. g. logs) can mitigate
   grazing impacts. We examined how beetles responded to experimentally
   manipulated kangaroo Macropus giganteus grazing levels using both
   exclosure fences and addition of logs over a 16-month period.
   2. We analysed beetle responses across (a) one-hectare sites, by
   focusing on the interaction between grazing level and log volume, and
   (b) microhabitats, by focusing on the interaction between grazing level
   and microhabitat structure (in open ground or at experimental logs).
   3. At the site scale, we detected significant negative effects of
   grazing and positive effects of logs on beetle abundance and species
   richness. Beetle trophic groups responded in the same direction across
   grazing levels with herbivores, detritivores and predators all having
   higher abundance and species richness at low grazing levels. Logs
   applied at 20 t ha(-1) in clumped arrangements had the largest positive
   effect on beetles at low grazing levels. At the microhabitat scale,
   beetles sampled adjacent to experimental logs showed an increase in
   abundance and species richness compared with beetles sampled from open
   ground, indicating logs are acting as microhabitat buffers from grazing.
   4. Synthesis and applications. A reduction in grazing level had benefits
   for the abundance and species richness of beetles at the site scale.
   Further benefits were achieved at both site and microhabitat scales when
   logs are used in combination with exclosure fencing. For ecological
   restoration, exclosure fences and logs can be used to manage the impacts
   of vertebrate herbivores at different spatial scales. The rapid response
   of beetles suggests there may be potential for cascading effects on
   other biota as a consequence of reduced grazing, including increased
   food availability for insectivorous vertebrates.}},

Abstract = {{1. Protected natural areas often inherit legacies of altered habitat and
   predator-prey dynamics. Extirpation of top predators and ecosystem
   engineers modifies the density and distribution of the remaining
   species, with potentially significant ramifications for ecological
   condition. Land managers need, among other things, information on how
   populations of large grazing animals affect their habitat when key
   components are missing from the ecosystem.
   2. Our objective was to examine correlations between intensive grazing
   by Cervus elaphus (red deer or North American elk) and soil processes in
   a protected natural area with a history of predator reduction and
   habitat modification. We used 12 exclosures constructed in 1994 to
   compare soil carbon and nitrogen, nitrogen cycling, bulk density, soil
   moisture and soil microbial characteristics in grazed and ungrazed
   areas. Samples were collected in 1998 and in 2010.
   3. Soil carbon (C) concentration was 25\% lower in grazed areas than in
   exclosures; soil nitrogen (N) concentration was 23\% lower. From 1998 to
   2010, the mean percentage change for soil C and N concentrations was +
   14\% and + 27\%, respectively, in exclosures and -22\% and -24\%,
   respectively, in grazed sites.
   4. Soil bulk density in grazed areas was 25\% greater than in ungrazed
   areas; soil moisture in grazed areas was 15\% lower than in ungrazed
   areas.
   5. Physical soil attributes, soil nutrient stocks and soil microbial
   biomass were significantly correlated, exhibiting linkages that can
   accelerate changes in ecosystem function. Plant N concentrations suggest
   soil nutrient losses were not related to substitutions for N-rich forage
   species.
   6. Synthesis and applications. Intensive grazing was correlated with
   drier more compacted soils and nutrient loss, suggesting increasing N
   limitation and reduced plant biodiversity. Recovery of soil nutrients
   and soil structure appears possible in the studied montane riparian zone
   if vegetation receives grazing protection. Cervus elaphus density and
   distribution should be controlled in the short term to restore soil
   structure, hydraulic conductivity and nutrients. Active management could
   be obviated in the longer term through restoration of predators and
   ecosystem engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive studies reveal that there is much uncertainty regarding how
   ecosystem and soil respiration will respond to warming and grazing,
   especially in the alpine meadow ecosystem. We conducted a first of its
   kind field-manipulative warming and grazing experiment in an alpine
   meadow on the Tibetan plateau to determine the effects of warming and
   grazing on ecosystem and soil respiration for 3-years, from 2006 to
   2008. Generally, warming and grazing did not affect seasonal average
   ecosystem respiration (Re), and there was no interaction between grazing
   and warming. However, they significantly affected the Re early in the
   growing season and by the end of the growing season. Warming
   significantly increased seasonal average soil respiration (Rs) by 9.2\%,
   whereas the difference mainly resulted from data gathered early in the
   growing season, before June 2007. Positive correlations between soil
   temperature and Re and Rs were observed, and soil temperature explained
   63-83\% of seasonal Re variations during the 3-year study and 19-34\% of
   Rs variations in 2007. Seasonal Re in 2008 and Rs in 2007 were slightly
   negatively correlated to soil moisture, but interannual average Re
   decreased with a decrease in precipitation for all treatments. Warming
   and grazing reduced the Q(10) value of Re in 2007 and 2008 but did not
   affect the Q(10) value of Rs. The Q(10) values of Rs were much lower
   than the Q(10) values of Re in 2007. These results suggest that grazing
   may reduce the temperature sensitivity of Re and that Re was mainly
   controlled by soil temperature rather than moisture which varied with
   timescale in the alpine meadow. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{To provide necessary information for the management of biodiversity on
   Sable Island, Nova Scotia, we studied the effects of feral horses on
   vegetation using exclosures and ancillary observations. Nine plant
   communities inside and outside of six exclosures were compared using
   various vegetation parameters and Mann-Whitney tests to evaluate the
   significance of differences. The most important findings were as
   follows: (I) effects of horses were greatest in the Marram (Ammophila
   breviligulata) grassland and much less in the communities that were not
   dominated by Marram Grass; (2) effects on Marram grassland varied
   substantially among sites; (3) the cover of standing litter of
   herbaceous plants was on average of 9.3 times greater inside exclosures
   in grassland habitats; (4) the cover of living foliage was usually
   higher inside exclosures, but not all differences were significant; (5)
   species richness and species diversity were not substantially affected;
   (6) the average cover of Marram Grass, the most abundant plant and a key
   sand binder on the island, was greater inside exclosures in six of seven
   study sites, significantly so in three of them; and (7) there were
   inconsistent differences in cover of other species at different sites.
   Wetland habitats cover a relatively small portion of Sable Island, but
   they support much of the plant biodiversity. There is evidence of strong
   but variable effects of horses on wetland vegetation. ``Horse lawns{''}
   are littoral habitats dominated by Agrostis stolonifera (Carpet
   Bentgrass) and other low-growing plants. The lawn habitats represent
   less than 1\% of the island's vegetation, and their presence is believed
   to be due to grazing and trampling by horses.}},

Abstract = {{In the microregion of Maraba-Para, the cattle pastures of the family
   farmers present a high diversity of trees and palm trees which have an
   important role in limiting biodiversity degradation and for its
   utilities. The study was carried out in 26 properties, where 62 cattle
   pastures were visited with the farmer. In each cattle pasture, it was
   listed all trees and palm trees present in the area. Seventy-one species
   were found, belonging to 32 families of which 9 were stood out with the
   greatest number of species: Caesalpiniaceae (11), Mimosaceae (10),
   Arecaceae (4), Lecythidaceae (4), Bignoniaceae (3), Fabaceae (3),
   Moraceae (3), Sapotaceae (3) and Sterculiaceae (3); twenty families
   present one single species. Twenty-four species (34\% of total) belonged
   to 3 Leguminosae families (Fabaceae, Caesalpiniaceae and Mimosaceae).
   The tree species are held mainly because of the various uses on the
   property. Out of the 21 species, suitable for afforestation of cattle
   pasture of farmers of this and other communities, 9 species are
   particularly recommended because of their fire resistance and for many
   years of grazing, and because they have two or more uses: Caryocar

Abstract = {{Grasslands are usually the most suitable environment for butterflies,
   but have been also traditionally used for productive activities. This
   paper compares the impact of mowing and grazing on butterfly
   biodiversity in two S Italian (Campania) grasslands, at Campo Somma (CS)
   and Pianoro di Prada (PP) located at an identical altitude of 850 m.
   These grasslands have an area of approximately 6 ha each and are at a 3
   km distance from each other. They share similar climate and are both
   surrounded by woods, mainly of sweet chestnut. CS is managed for haying
   and is mown once a year, in June. PP is used for sheep and cattle
   grazing. Weekly transects were made from April to September in 2008 and
   2009, during the butterfly flight activity. We analysed data from eight
   monthly transects by Kruskal- Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. We observed
   45 butterfly species at PP, and 28 at CS. Diversity indexes were
   significantly higher at PP, whereas evenness was similar. The monthly
   comparisons of species richness showed that, except for April, PP values
   were always significantly higher. Species abundance was significantly
   higher at PP in June, July and August. In all months, except in April,
   the Shannon-Wiener index was also significantly higher at PP, as was
   Simpson's index in May, June and September. Dominance index differed
   significantly only in May, June and September, whereas evenness was
   never significantly different between the two grasslands. These data
   show that, as concerns butterflies, the impact of mowing was much
   stronger than that of grazing.}},

Abstract = {{Our study used `stand structures' and `ecological indicators' as
   inferences to managing dry Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel)
   Franco) forests for timber, biodiversity and range habitat attributes at
   10-12 years after partial harvesting. Forest structures included
   densities and sizes of Douglas-fir and species and structural diversity
   of total conifers. Ecological indicators included cattle forage species
   in the understorey vegetation and three small mammal species: a
   closed-canopy specialist, the southern red-backed vole (Myodes gapperi
   Vigors) and two early successional species, the long-tailed vole
   (Microtus longicaudus Merriam) and heather vole (Phenacomys intermedius
   Merriam). Harvesting treatments were across a gradient of historical
   cut, individual tree selection and patch cut sites in the upper Interior
   Douglas-fir (IDF(dk)) biogeoclimatic zone near Summerland, British
   Columbia, Canada. Small mammal populations were sampled from 2006 to
   2008. Closed-canopy forest structure seemed to maintain populations of
   red-backed voles in the harvested sites. Development of understorey
   vegetation in harvest-origin openings was similar across the levels of
   partial cutting and provided at least five plant species for cattle
   forage. Patches of grassland and shrubland in all treatment sites
   maintained viable populations of long-tailed voles and heather voles.
   These three small mammal indicators represent both late and early
   successional conditions in these IDF forests, which need to be managed
   for multiple objectives. Long-term monitoring of indicators will verify
   relationships with the components of biodiversity that they represent.}},

Title = {{Aboveground Macroinvertebrate Diversity and Abundance in Sand Sagebrush
   Prairie Managed With the Use of Pyric Herbivory}},
Journal = {{RANGELAND ECOLOGY \& MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{394-403}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Through pyric herbivory (i.e., fire-induced grazing patterns), native
   grasslands were historically a spatially heterogeneous environment. It
   is hypothesized that the mosaic of habitats created by pyric herbivory
   supports a more diverse invertebrate community compared to modern range
   management. Patch-burn management, a pyric herbivory technique, is an
   application of prescribed fire and grazing whereby the timing and
   location of the burned and grazed patches is varied, creating a
   diversity of habitat conditions. Although disturbance in sandsage
   (Artemisia filifolium Torr.) prairie historically included fire and
   grazing, fire disturbance has been nearly eradicated from this ecosystem
   in western Oklahoma. We compared patch-burn management to traditional
   management (i.e., moderate grazing with no fire) in sandsage prairie to
   evaluate the impact of these two management regimes on aboveground
   invertebrates. We sampled invertebrates at 44 points in each of 3 mo
   (May, June, and July) with the use of Dietrick vacuum sampling.
   Diversity, total abundance, and abundance of seven invertebrate orders
   (Araneae, Diptera, Hemiptera, Homoptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and
   Orthoptera) were similar between patch-burn and traditional pastures.
   When examined on a patch level, five invertebrate orders were also
   similar between their respective time since burn patch and the
   traditional patches. Araneae and Coleoptera abundance were higher in
   traditional patches, and Hemiptera abundance was higher in current-year
   burn patches. Our results suggest a heterogeneity-based management
   scheme based on pyric herbivory does not negatively impact the overall
   invertebrate community and may benefit a wider variety of invertebrates
   by providing areas of varying levels of disturbance. In comparison,
   homogeneous landscapes such as those created by traditional management
   may only benefit segments of the invertebrate community that have
   habitat associations with moderately disturbed or undisturbed areas.
   Therefore, a disturbance regime involving the interaction of fire and
   grazing may be valuable for maintaining biodiversity and productivity
   within sandsage prairie ecosystems.}},

Abstract = {{Nutrient enrichment of habitats (eutrophication) is considered to be one
   of the main causes of plant diversity decline worldwide. Several
   experiments have shown a rapid loss of species in the first years after
   fertilization started. However, little is known about changes in species
   richness in the long term. Here, we use a 50-year-old field experiment
   with a range of fertilization treatments in grasslands that were mown
   twice each year in the center of The Netherlands. We show that species
   richness in all plots initially declined but started to recover after
   similar to 25 years of continued fertilization. This was also true for
   the heavily fertilized treatment (NPK). In NPK-fertilized plots, the
   decline was strongest and associated with a strong divergence of plant
   trait composition from the control, reflecting a shift to a plant
   community adapted to nutrient-rich conditions. During the subsequent
   period of increase in species richness, the trait composition remained
   stable. These results show that plant species richness can, at least
   partially, recover after an initial diversity decline caused by
   fertilization.}},

Abstract = {{Premise of the study : Invasive plants represent a significant threat to
   ecosystem biodiversity. To decrease the impacts of invasive species, a
   major scientific undertaking of the last few decades has been aimed at
   understanding the mechanisms that drive invasive plant success. Most
   studies and theories have focused on a single mechanism for predicting
   the success of invasive plants and therefore cannot provide insight as
   to the relative importance of multiple interactions in predicting
   invasive species' success.
   Methods : We examine four mechanisms that potentially contribute to the
   success of invasive velvetgrass Holcus lanatus : direct competition,
   indirect competition mediated by mammalian herbivores, interference
   competition via allelopathy, and indirect competition mediated by
   changes in the soil community. Using a combination of field and
   greenhouse approaches, we focus on the effects of H. lanatus on a common
   species in California coastal prairies, Erigeron glaucus, where the
   invasion is most intense.
   Key results : We found that H. lanatus had the strongest effects on E.
   glaucus via direct competition, but it also influenced the soil
   community in ways that feed back to negatively influence E. glaucus and
   other native species after H. lanatus removal.
   Conclusions : This approach provided evidence for multiple mechanisms

Abstract = {{Grazing and fire have been the most common disturbances in many
   grasslands ecosystems for many centuries. However, some mountain regions
   are currently experiencing a decrease in land use, and therefore in
   frequency or intensity of these disturbances. In this study, we
   evaluated how fire and grazing affect vegetation structure in mountain
   grasslands of NW Argentina. We hypothesized that they would have
   differential effects on plant species richness, vegetation composition
   and aerial biomass dynamics, predicting that fire would have a stronger
   effect on these variables than grazing. We tested this hypothesis by
   performing a controlled field experiment in which we manipulated fire
   and compared grazed plots with ungrazed exclosures, simulating current
   (high frequent fires and low livestock load) and future (fire
   suppression and grazing exclosure) scenarios. We recorded total of 90
   species with 40 shared among all treatments. Tussock grasses (Elionurus
   muticus), followed by three shrubs represented the main contribution to
   live biomass in all treatments. Species richness, equitativity and
   diversity were higher in burned plots. Multivariate ordination indicated
   that burning is more important than grazing in determining plot to plot
   similarity in species composition. Burning reduced total aerial biomass,
   standing dead biomass and litter, as well as live biomass, that was also
   reduced by grazing. Burning also reduced standing dead biomass and
   litter proportions, but increased live biomass contribution, showing a
   more evident effect within the grazed plots. Burning, seasonality and
   growing season had significant effects on the relative contribution of
   all biomass categories. Biomass consumption showed a strong seasonality,
   being significantly higher in January of both growing seasons, and it
   was not affected by burning. We conclude that under the current fire and
   grazing scenario, fire plays a more important role than grazing in
   shaping these grasslands dynamics. (C)2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{Management affects ecosystem structure in many ways. Structural changes
   in ecosystems, including shifts in vegetation composition and species
   diversity, will affect the goods and services provided at ecosystem and
   regional scales. This is relevant for agricultural production and
   agro-biodiversity preservation in the context of management changes
   currently occurring in many regions. We sampled 39 sainfoin swards in
   the Eastern Pyrenees to assess changes in vegetation structure with
   sward management and evaluated how those changes might sustain
   agro-diversity regionally. Three sward managements coexist in the
   region: (a) mown plus sheep-grazed, (b) mown plus cattle-grazed and (c)
   only mown. Plant species composition and richness, and various biomass
   variables were estimated at peak biomass on swards with the three
   managements and different ages. We used a synchronic approach to study
   time effects, in which swards of different ages are sampled
   simultaneously, in a space by time substitution. Multivariate analysis
   and similarity indices revealed strong shifts in vegetation composition
   with management, enhanced with sward age, when the suppressive effect of
   sown on unsown plants relaxed. Generally, plant species richness
   increased with time. Old mown swards showed the highest number of
   species per plot (34 in 4 m(2)). Cattle-grazed swards showed the highest
   within- and between-treatment vegetation dissimilarity with time.
   Biomass variables responded mainly to time effects, but total
   aboveground biomass decreased with unsown species and increased with
   species richness depending on management. Thus, the diversity of
   managements modified the expected outcome in local and regional
   agro-diversity and sward structure. Our results are novel because they
   demonstrate strong effects of grazing by different animals on local and
   regional agro-diversity and herbage composition in those ephemeral
   legume-based forage systems. Farmers and managers should take into
   account those shifts in order to achieve agricultural goals, including
   agro-diversity conservation and sustainable forage production at
   ecosystem and regional scales.}},

Title = {{Frequent burning promotes invasions of alien plants into a mesic African
   savanna}},
Journal = {{BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1641-1648}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Fire is both inevitable and necessary for maintaining the structure and
   functioning of mesic savannas. Without disturbances such as fire and
   herbivory, tree cover can increase at the expense of grass cover and
   over time dominate mesic savannas. Consequently, repeated burning is
   widely used to suppress tree recruitment and control bush encroachment.
   However, the effect of regular burning on invasion by alien plant
   species is little understood. Here, vegetation data from a long-term
   fire experiment, which began in 1953 in a mesic Zimbabwean savanna, were
   used to test whether the frequency of burning promoted alien plant
   invasion. The fire treatments consisted of late season fires, lit at 1-,
   2-, 3-, and 4-year intervals, and these regularly burnt plots were
   compared with unburnt plots. Results show that over half a century of
   frequent burning promoted the invasion by alien plants relative to areas
   where fire was excluded. More alien plant species became established in
   plots that had a higher frequency of burning. The proportion of alien
   species in the species assemblage was highest in the annually burnt
   plots followed by plots burnt biennially. Alien plant invasion was
   lowest in plots protected from fire but did not differ significantly
   between plots burnt triennially and quadrennially. Further, the
   abundance of five alien forbs increased significantly as the interval
   (in years) between fires became shorter. On average, the density of
   these alien forbs in annually burnt plots was at least ten times as high
   as the density of unburnt plots. Plant diversity was also altered by
   long-term burning. Total plant species richness was significantly lower
   in the unburnt plots compared to regularly burnt plots. These findings
   suggest that frequent burning of mesic savannas enhances invasion by
   alien plants, with short intervals between fires favouring alien forbs.
   Therefore, reducing the frequency of burning may be a key to minimising
   the risk of alien plant spread into mesic savannas, which is important
   because invasive plants pose a threat to native biodiversity and may
   alter savanna functioning.}},

Abstract = {{Mowing and plant removal is a traditional practice in low-intensity
   farming and likely to lead to high plant species richness. Even today,
   scientific knowledge on the impact of mowing on seed availability is
   still very limited. We studied whether the seed availability of ditch
   bank plant species was affected by the timing of mowing and, if so,
   whether the effect varied according to management regime (nature
   reserve, agri-environment scheme (AES) with long-term management, AES
   with short-term management, conventional management). Our focus was on
   seed availability for transportation, because restoration of ditch bank
   vegetation is known to be limited by seed dispersal. The presence and
   seed-setting of 25 target species in 384 plots were recorded at the
   mowing date, under four management regimes. A Hierarchical Generalised
   Linear Model (HGLM) was used to analyse the effects of mowing date and
   management on the number of species setting seed. It suggests that when
   the mowing is twice annually, mowing on July 1st and on September 1st
   will result in a maximum number of species of which the seeds are
   available for transportation and, therefore, create largest
   opportunities for seed dispersal on ditch banks in the western peat area
   of the Netherlands. The effect of mowing date differs among species,
   with certain rare species like Caltha palustris and Lythrum salicaria in
   particular differing from the commoner species. A flexible mowing regime
   varying from year to year would therefore help to protect these rare
   species. The later peak in seed-setting found in nature reserves and
   long-term AES suggest a postponed mowing compared to conventionally
   management and short-term AES. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Volume = {{166}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{761-768}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A growing body of empirical evidence suggests that the temporal
   stability of communities typically increases with diversity. The
   counterview to this is that dominant species, rather than diversity
   itself, might regulate temporal stability. However, empirical studies
   that have explicitly examined the relative importance of diversity and
   dominant species in maintaining community stability have yielded few
   clear-cut patterns. Here, using a long-term data set, we examined the
   relative importance of changes in diversity components and dominance
   hierarchy following the removal of a dominant C4 grass, Bouteloua
   gracilis, in stabilizing plant communities. We also examined the
   relationships between the variables of diversity and dominance hierarchy
   and the statistical components of temporal stability. We found a
   significant negative relationship between temporal stability and species
   richness, number of rare species, and relative abundance of rare
   species, whereas a significant positive relationship existed between
   temporal stability and relative abundance of the dominant species.
   Variances and covariances summed over all species significantly
   increased with increasing species richness, whereas they significantly
   decreased with increasing relative abundance of dominant species. We
   showed that temporal stability in a shortgrass steppe plant community
   was controlled by dominant species rather than by diversity itself. The
   generality of diversity-stability relationships might be restricted by
   the dynamics of dominant species, especially when they have
   characteristics that contribute to stability in highly stochastic
   systems. A clear implication is that dominance hierarchies and their
   changes might be among the most important ecological components to
   consider in managing communities to maintain ecosystem functioning.}},

Journal = {{OIKOS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1013-1022}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Despite the well-documented impacts of consumers on seed abundance the
   link between seed predation and plant population dynamics remains poorly
   understood because experimental studies linking patterns of predation
   with seedling establishment are rare. We used experimental manipulations
   with six woody plant species to elucidate the effects of seed predator
   type, habitat, and plant species identity on rates of seed predation and
   seedling recruitment in the Neotropical savannas known as the Cerrado.
   We found that seed predation rates are consistently high across a
   diversity of local habitat types, with important inter-habitat variation
   in seed predation for three of the six species used in our experiments.
   We also found that seed predation has a clear demographic signal -
   experimentally excluding predators resulted in higher rates of seedling
   establishment over the course of two seasons. Because the intensity of
   seed predation varied between species and habitats, it may play a role
   in structuring local patterns of plant abundance and community
   composition. Finally, our results lend support to the recent hypothesis
   that herbivores have major and underappreciated impacts in Neotropical
   savannas, and that top-down factors can influence the demography of
   plants in this extensive and biodiversity-rich biome in previously
   unexplored ways.}},

Abstract = {{Agricultural intensification threatens grasslands worldwide and the
   restoration of grasslands from arable lands can at least partially
   counter this threat. We studied grassland restoration by following early
   successional changes of arthropod assemblages (spiders, Araneae; true
   bugs, Heteroptera; orthopterans, Orthoptera; and ground beetles,
   Carabidae) on 1- and 2-year-old restorations using arable lands and
   native grasslands as two ends of the succession timescale. To examine
   the changes in species composition among the habitat types, we used
   habitat affinity indices based on fidelity and/or specificity of the
   species. We found that the number of species did not differ between
   habitat types, while species composition changed markedly with time.
   Species richness was thus not adequate to detect favorable changes after
   grassland restoration. Habitat affinity indices, on the other hand, were
   useful to detect compositional changes caused by the increasing numbers
   of species characteristic of target grasslands as early as the second
   year after restoration. Habitat affinity indices are easy-to-use,
   easy-to-interpret measures of restoration success; therefore, we
   recommend their use as measures complementary to species richness and
   simple similarity. Our results show that sowing low-diversity seed
   mixture followed by mowing and grazing can be particularly successful in
   grassland restoration in time periods as short as 2 years.}},

Title = {{Balancing pest management and forest biodiversity: Vole populations and

Journal = {{CROP PROTECTION}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{833-843}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Voles of the genus Microtus are long-standing pests in temperate and
   boreal forests of North America, Europe, and Asia where they feed on
   newly planted trees on cutover forest land. Clearcutting (CC) dominates
   forest harvesting and produces homogeneous habitats for voles. Variable
   retention (VR) harvests involve various partial cutting practices that
   produce heterogeneous habitat patterns compared with CC. This study
   tested the hypotheses (H) that compared to CC, VR harvesting will (H(1))
   limit population size of Microtus and feeding damage to tree seedlings;
   (H(2)) provide some mature forest habitat for red-backed voles (Myodes
   gapperi); and (H(3)) enhance abundance and species diversity of the
   terrestrial small mammal community. Microtus, red-backed voles, and
   other forest-floor small mammals were live-trapped for three years
   (2007-2009) on ``young{''} and ``older{''} CC and VR sites near Golden,
   British Columbia, Canada. Mean basal area (BA) and density of overstory
   coniferous trees were significantly (P <= 0.03) higher in the young VR
   than CC sites. Abundance of herbaceous vegetation and grasses was
   similar in both harvesting systems at 3- and 5-years post-harvest.
   Although not statistically significant, the relatively higher numbers
   (2.3-2.9 times) of Microtus on CC than VR sites at 3-4 years
   post-harvest is suggestive that VR may reduce Microtus population size.
   However, the mean abundance of 35 Microtus/ha in VR sites at 3 years
   post-harvest was at the border-line of moderate to high risk of feeding
   damage. Based on equivocal levels of vole damage to plantation trees on
   CC and VR sites, the damage part of H(1) was refuted. With respect to
   H(2), VR harvesting did provide some forest habitat for red-backed
   voles, at least initially in the third year, and then again at 10-20
   years, after VR cutting. Total abundance and species diversity of the
   terrestrial small mammal community were similar in CC and VR sites, and
   hence H(3) was rejected. The mean BA (14.7 m(2)/ha) and density (73-127
   trees/ha) of overstory (>10-20 m height) trees of our VR sites were
   insufficient to alter development of understory herbaceous vegetation
   and abundance of Microtus. Higher levels of VR should be investigated as
   a means of reducing this pest problem in young plantations. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Cessation of grazing is an increasing threat to the biodiversity rich
   semi-natural pastures in Sweden due to a decreased number of grazing
   livestock despite environmental payments for management of these
   pastures. The aim of this study is to compare the profitability of
   raising beef breed calves as intact bulls kept indoors after weaning and
   slaughtered at 15 months to raising them as steers grazing semi-natural
   pastures and slaughtered at 20, 25 or 30 months of age. The 20 and 25
   month steers graze one summer and the 30 month steers two summers
   post-weaning. Profitability is calculated as gross margin to cover fixed
   costs of the farm and background data is obtained from an animal
   experiment and official Swedish standard budgets. The comparisons
   include alternatives with holdings situated in one out of two districts
   (plain or forest) and with one out of six types of semi-natural pasture
   (low-or high-yielding pasture, pasture with payment on a base level only
   or with extra payment for special values, 100\% semi-natural pasture or
   50\% semi-natural pasture with 50\% complementary ley pasture). The
   result suggests that the 30 month steer is the most profitable
   production system in most of the studied alternatives provided that the
   present environmental payments, single farm payment and support for less
   favoured areas are maintained. Bulls are more profitable than 30 month
   steers only if the semi-natural pasture is both high-yielding and
   entitled payment on a base level only. The 20 and 25 month steers have
   no economical competitiveness in any of the alternatives studied. Steers
   with two post-weaning grazing seasons seem to be a cost-efficient way to
   preserve the grazing dependent biodiversity in Sweden and other parts of
   Europe with increasing shortage of calves. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All

Abstract = {{The effect of grazing was studied on vegetation structure, herbaceous
   biomass, basal and bare ground covers, together with soil nutrient
   concentrations in two locations in an Ethiopian semi-arid savanna. The
   lightly grazed sites had significantly higher herbaceous diversity,
   total abundance, basal cover and aboveground biomass, and a lower
   percentage of bare ground compared with the heavy grazed sites. Grazing
   pressure had no effect on the density and number of woody species as
   well as on the proportion of encroaching woody species. The light
   grazing sites had higher organic carbon, phosphorus and exchangeable
   bases, and therefore a higher pH and higher electrical conductance,
   indicating an improved soil nutrient status compared with heavy grazing
   sites, mainly attributed to the higher basal cover and standing biomass
   at light grazed sites, and the export of nutrients through grazing and
   dung collection from the heavily grazed sites. There were significantly
   higher soil nutrients, species diversity, aboveground biomass and basal
   cover in the light grazing sites compared with heavy grazing sites. We
   concluded that changes in herbaceous vegetation, standing biomass and
   soil compositions are caused by interactions between grazing, soil and
   vegetation, and these interactions determine the transitions of
   semi-arid savannas. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The multifunctional agronomic, ecological, economic and social uses of
   grass-based agricultural systems in peri-urban Marion County, Iowa, were
   the subject of investigation from 2003 to 2005. Following a
   sociocultural analysis that identified diverse motivations of cow-calf
   operators, an on-farm, agroecological experiment was established with a
   member of the study group. The objective of the experiment was to
   investigate the feasibility of establishing a multifunctional prairie
   pasture in response to the operator's interest in certified organic,
   warm-season plant species paddocks. At the field level, the
   implementation of native grasses and legumes into fallow pasture without
   the use of herbicides under flash grazing, mowing and unmanaged control
   treatments showed differences in species establishment and pasture
   composition. After three growing seasons, native species were evident in
   all treatments, with no significant differences between grazing and
   mowing in total native species establishment. There was a trend toward
   greater native legume establishment in the control over the managed
   treatments. Thus, total species abundance was greatest in control plots,
   suggesting this treatment for maximum prairie pasture establishment
   without herbicides. Concurrence was observed between motivations
   expressed by cow-calf operators in the sociocultural study (i.e.
   biodiversity preservation and sustainable management of natural
   resources) and outcomes from the prairie pasture experimental system.
   Support for grass-based systems from local institutions at the community
   level is necessary for the expansion of prairie pastures in Iowa and
   throughout the tallgrass prairie region.}},

Abstract = {{The Elqui river basin (Coquimbo Region, Chile) is an important
   fruit-growing and tourist center in the North and Central area of Chile,
   where climate conditions are characterized by a rise in temperature and
   decrease in precipitation. Within the context of global warming, the
   hydrographical basin of the Elqui River is expected to show a rising
   trend toward aridity, as well as alterations in the phenology of plants
   and arthropods, and changes in the local biodiversity and richness of
   ecosystems. In this respect, this research analyzes the taxonomic
   composition, abundance and distribution of the assemblage of Orthoptera
   (Insecta) through hand-collecting in rangeland and farmland of the
   localities of Marquesa, Diaguitas, and Pisco Elqui in the Elqui valley.
   We documented the taxonomic composition and abundance of the Orthoptera
   assemblage (Insecta), and analyzed the spatial distribution of its
   component species by using SIG. We also documented the potential
   orthopterans have to become a plague in this arid watershed of
   North-Central Chile. A total of 204 specimens were captured, belonging
   to four families and six species, five of which were common to rangeland
   and farmland. Acrididae was the most abundant and varied family among
   the study sites (65.2\% of the total captured) and Trimerotropis
   ochraceipennis the most abundant species. The families Gryllidae,
   Ommexechidae and Tristiridae were represented by only one species. The
   presence of these species in the rangeland can be a risk factor for
   agriculture, considering potential irruptive outbreaks under certain
   climate conditions, and can also cause damage to crops, plantations and
   grasslands. The relationship between microdistribution of the Orthoptera
   assemblage present in the Elqui valley and the NDVI index showed a clear
   preference for dense and not so dense vegetation (NDVI = 0.1 - 0.49).
   This is a first approach to the study of orthopterans which are
   considered potential plagues to the Elqui valley.}},

Abstract = {{An important question in biodiversity studies is whether disturbances in
   ecosystems will cause a net loss of species or whether such losses can
   be compensated by replacement of other species. We use two natural
   disturbances, fire and grazing, to examine the response of bird and
   arthropod communities in grasslands of Serengeti, Tanzania. Both burning
   and grazing by migrant ungulates take place at the end of the rains in
   June-July. We documented the communities before disturbance, then 1, 4
   and 20 weeks after disturbance on three replicate plots and compared
   them with three undisturbed plots. Birds were recorded by observation,
   arthropods from pitfall, tray trap and sweepnet samples. We expected
   that as the grass biomass was reduced by either disturbance, bird
   communities would change with concomitant change in arthropod food
   abundance. Alternatively, bird communities would change not with the
   absolute amount of food but with the greater accessibility of food as
   the grass structure changed from long to short grass. Results showed
   first that both bird species richness and abundance increased after both
   types of disturbance, but burnt sites showed a greater increase than
   that for grazed sites. Second, there was a change in bird species
   composition with disturbance. The functionally equivalent athi
   short-toed lark (Calandrella athensis) was replaced by the red-capped
   lark (Calandrella cinerea). Third, the abundance of most groups of
   arthropods was lower on disturbed sites than those on undisturbed sites,
   and the reduction of arthropod numbers was greatest on burnt sites.
   These results imply that bird abundance did not occur through an
   increase in arthropod abundance but rather through a change in the grass
   structure making food more accessible; and the higher predation could
   have caused the lower arthropod abundance. In addition, some bird
   species replaced others thus functionally compensating for their loss.}},

Abstract = {{In Swedish boreal landscapes, the loss of species-rich semi-natural
   grasslands is largely due to a long history of agricultural abandonment.
   Large areas historically managed as meadows have become mature
   coniferous forest. This study focused on the potential biological legacy
   following a long period of grassland abandonment. The butterfly fauna in
   clear-cuts which was historically meadows and abandoned long enough to
   allow a generation of conifers to mature (70-90 years) was compared with
   clear-cuts which were historically coniferous forest. The results showed
   that clear-cuts historically managed as meadows were: (i) much richer in
   individuals, (ii) more species-rich, and (iii) contained many more
   grassland specialists than clear-cuts with a history as forest, with
   many of these species threatened in other parts of Europe.
   The results from our study demonstrate for the first time, to our
   knowledge, that the legacy of historical land-use in remnant plant
   communities can affect butterfly diversity in clear-cuts and hence the
   large-scale dynamics over a timescale of a full tree rotation. The
   results of this study have implications for forest management practices.
   Replanting clear-cuts on land that was previously meadows with deciduous
   trees or allowing the forest to regenerate naturally instead of planting
   conifers would make it possible to preserve a greater diversity of
   habitats for butterflies and other organisms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Pages = {{1928-1935}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Across the southeastern United States, changing disturbance regimes
   threaten the integrity of pine flatwoods, reducing their suitability as
   habitat for a variety of avian species, many of which are considered of
   conservation priority. Prescribed burning and roller chopping are
   management practices widely used in pine flatwoods to control shrubs and
   increase the growth of herbaceous vegetation. However, the impacts these
   treatments have on this system and its associated avian communities are
   largely unknown. We examined the effects of prescribed burning and
   roller chopping on pine flatwoods avian communities using a paired
   sample approach. Avian communities were compared between treated (e.g.,
   burned) and untreated areas. We considered abundance and richness of all
   birds, but also groups of conservation concern, and those likely
   impacted by seasonal management practices (e.g., breeding and
   non-breeding categories, and woodland, successional-scrub, and grassland
   guilds). Dormant season burning resulted in decreases in avian species
   richness and abundance within the non-breeding, overwintering community.
   In situations where the maintenance or enhancement of this avian group
   is desired, growing season burning appears beneficial and should be used
   in preference to dormant season burning. Growing season burning
   benefited breeding avian communities, resulting in increases in species
   richness and abundance within this group. Dormant season roller chopping
   had no effect on species richness or abundance of any avian category or
   guild. Increases in abundance within breeding avian communities were
   observed following growing season roller chopping and a roller
   chopping/burning combination. Grazing, did not mediate the effects of
   prescribed burning or roller chopping on avian species richness or
   abundance. The use of dormant season burning is likely inappropriate in
   situations where conservation and management of non-breeding,
   overwintering species is a priority. The use of growing season roller
   chopping appears to provide a potential treatment alternative in
   situations where positive effects on breeding species are desired.
   Overall, maintenance of avian abundance and richness may be best
   achieved through the diverse application of prescribed burning and
   roller chopping based on season, frequency, and space. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The frequency of clonal plants in different vegetation types is known to
   be influenced by environmental and land-use factors. However, the
   underlying behavior of individual clonal traits or clonal trait
   diversity has received little attention. Here, we assess for species-
   and trait-diverse grasslands of the Swiss Alps the relative importance
   of temperature, soil moisture, land use and species richness on the
   diversity and frequency of individual compared with all clonal traits.
   We further analyzed how cover-weighted data alters the relationships
   found with commonly used presence-absence data. We combined species
   compositional, land-use and environmental data from 236 28-m(2)
   grassland plots with clonal trait information for 527 species following
   the Clonal Growth Organ (CGO) classification. Test results are based on
   linear models, ANOVAs and ANCOVAs. The grassland sites were 84\%
   dominated by clonal species. Drought-prone grasslands harbored the least
   clonal species. No increase in clonality was detected with decreasing
   temperature (= altitude). Mown or pastured grasslands had more clonal
   species than fallows. Certain sets of traits were correlated.
   Rhizomatous species especially reacted strongly to climatic and land-use
   gradients and had highest frequencies in cold, moist and disturbed
   sites. Clonal diversity was strongly dependent on species richness.
   Cover-weighted and presence-absence based estimates were largely
   similar. Overall, our data outlined that common clonal traits react
   differently to natural and land-use gradients as well as differently to
   the sum of clonal traits. Also, soil moisture was more decisive than
   temperature (= altitude) for the presence of clonal species. Lastly, the
   strong correlation between species-richness and clonal trait diversity
   needs to be accounted for when interpreting the functional role of
   clonal traits.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Small-scale vegetation patterns are frequently the results of
   plant-plant interactions such as facilitation and competition.
   Facilitation should be particularly pronounced when both abiotic and
   biotic stresses are high, but few studies were conducted in such
   habitats. In heavily-grazed pastures on the eastern Tibetan Plateau, an
   area with both high abiotic stress and strong biotic disturbance, we
   made releves of herb species both beneath and outside canopies of three
   shrub species (Spiraea alpina, Sibiraea angustata and Potentilla
   fruticosa) differing in palatability and canopy structure. Herb species
   richness (S), pooled cover (PC) of all species, number of flowering
   species (FS) and number of inflorescences of all species (IN) were
   greater outside than beneath the shrub canopies. Evenness (J), in
   contrast, was smaller outside, while Shannon's diversity index (H) was
   the same. Differences in S and J between plots beneath and outside the
   shrub canopies were greater in the case of P. fruticosa than in the
   cases of S. angustata and S. alpina, but differences in PC, FS or IN did
   not depend on the shrub species. Among the common species (frequency >=
   6), 47-85\% were equally frequent beneath and outside the shrubs,
   13-39\% were more frequent outside and 3-13\% were more frequent beneath
   the shrubs. For the rarest species (frequency < 6), however, more
   species occurred beneath than outside the shrubs. The ordination diagram
   showed a clear separation between the releves outside and beneath the
   shrubs and a gradient from P. fruticosa via S. alpina to S. angustata,
   accompanied by a distinct decrease in the extent of the difference
   between the vegetation beneath and outside the shrub canopies. In
   conclusion, the three shrub species facilitated some species in the herb
   layer and each shrub species had a specific impact, related to its
   canopy structure and palatability but also to the grazing pressure,
   which was greater around the P. fruticosa shrubs than around S. alpina
   and S. angustata.}},

Abstract = {{The present research deals with the impact of the invasive species
   Brachypodium genuense in central Apennine meadows. The study compares
   meadows under different management types (mown versus abandoned). B.
   genuense spread in the abandoned condition alters the ecological status
   of the site. It lowers soil temperature, moisture and pH, while it
   increases soil C/N ratio and litter production. In terms of biotic
   features, phenological analysis indicated that the abandoned condition
   is less rich in flowering species and individuals in each analysed date.
   We observed a less affected temporal niche (during the first phase of B.
   genuense leaf growth) and two strongly influenced phases (in early
   spring and in correspondence with phases when B. genuense flowers and
   has full growth of leaves). Functional trait analysis indicated that
   species with runners, ability to form patches, and late flowering
   strategies benefit from B. genuense spread, whereas species marked by
   storage organs, small size, and early flowering strategies benefit in
   the mown condition. However, it seems that only low frequency species
   are heavily threatened, while the others can remain inside the plant
   community by shelter niche occupation.}},

Abstract = {{Phenological mismatches due to climate change may have important
   ecological consequences. In a three-year study, phenological shifts due
   to experimental warming markedly altered trophic relationships between
   plants and insect herbivores, causing a dramatic decline of reproductive
   capacity for one of the plant species. In a Tibetan meadow, the gentian
   (Gentiana formosa) typically flowers after the peak larva density of a
   noctuid moth (Melanchra pisi) that primarily feeds on a dominant forb
   (anemone, Anemone trullifolia var. linearis). However, artificial
   warming of similar to 1.5 degrees C advanced gentian flower phenology
   and anemone vegetative phenology by a week, but delayed moth larvae
   emergence by two weeks. The warming increased larval density 10-fold,
   but decreased anemone density by 30\%. The phenological and density
   shifts under warmed conditions resulted in the insect larvae feeding
   substantially on the gentian flowers and ovules; there was similar to
   100-fold more damage in warmed than in unwarmed chambers. This radically
   increased trophic connection reduced gentian plant reproduction and
   likely contributed to its reduced abundance in the warmed chambers.}},

Title = {{Adaptive management and targeting of agri-environment schemes does
   benefit biodiversity: a case study of the corn bunting Emberiza calandra}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Agri-environment schemes (AES) are the main European policy
   response to biodiversity loss caused by agricultural intensification.
   Maximizing their effectiveness is a key policy challenge. Monitoring is
   essential to inform adaptation and improvement of schemes over time, and
   to understand how measures may need to vary across a species' range.
   2. We measured changes in breeding abundance of a severely declining
   bird, the corn bunting Emberiza calandra, in response to AES in Scotland
   over 7 years and 71 farms. Two AES were monitored, one with general
   management for farmland birds, and one with targeted, adaptive
   management for corn buntings. We use these data to estimate the
   proportion of the population that AES must influence to halt the overall
   decline.
   3. Corn buntings increased by 5 center dot 6\% per annum on farms in the
   targeted AES, showed no significant change on farms in the general AES,
   and declined by 14 center dot 5\% per annum on farms outside AES.
   4. In arable-dominated areas, AES management that increased food
   availability reversed population declines. However, where a high
   proportion of corn buntings nested in grasslands, an additional AES
   option that delayed mowing was essential to achieving population
   increase.
   5. Results suggest that approximately 72\% of the corn bunting
   population in mainland Scotland must receive targeted AES management to
   halt the current decline. In 2009, only 24\% was targeted in this way.
   6. Synthesis and applications. AES measures are capable of reversing
   corn bunting declines in Scotland, and the same measures are likely to
   benefit a wide range of other taxa too, but require geographical
   targeting and flexibility to adapt and improve management options,
   backed by expert advice. Targeted AES provision to the required level
   for corn buntings will cost approximately 120 pound 000 per annum, with
   500-600 ha under appropriate management. This is 0 center dot 02\% of
   annual subsidies paid to Scottish farmers, and 0 center dot 5\% of land
   in the remaining mainland range of the corn bunting. These outcomes
   illustrate the value of AES monitoring studies to assess scheme
   effectiveness, identify improvements, and determine the scale of
   implementation required for reversing species declines.}},

Title = {{Methods of enhancing botanical diversity within field margins of
   intensively managed grassland: a 7-year field experiment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{551-560}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{1. Increased intensification in agricultural grasslands has led to
   well-documented declines in the associated flora. Manipulation of field
   margins for biodiversity enhancement in arable systems has been
   extensively investigated. However, there is a paucity of corresponding
   long-term research within intensively managed grasslands.
   2. We investigated a combination of establishment and management methods
   to enhance botanical diversity of newly established field margins in
   intensively managed grasslands. Three methods of field margin
   establishment were investigated including fencing, natural regeneration
   by rotavation, or seeding with a wildflower mixture. Subsequent sward
   management by either grazing or mowing was tested at three margin
   widths. Success of establishment was addressed in terms of persistence
   of species richness, plant community composition and incidence of
   noxious weeds.
   3. Seeding with a wildflower mixture was the most successful
   establishment method to enhance plant species richness and this effect
   persisted throughout the 7 years of the experiment ((x) over bar= 16
   center dot 4 +/- 0 center dot 43 SE plant species richness per 1 x 3 m2
   quadrat). Mown = ((x) over bar =6 center dot 01 +/- 0 center dot 30 SE)
   and rotavated ((x) over bar= 9 center dot 7 +/- 0 center dot 34 SE)
   treatments contained significantly fewer plant species; grazed controls
   contained 9 center dot 83 +/- 0 center dot 24 species.
   4. Grazing led to a significant, but modest increase in species richness
   in fenced and rotavated plots compared to the mowing treatment, but had
   no effect in seeded plots. Grazing also led to an increased frequency
   and cover of competitive grasses in the seeded treatment.
   5. Although margin width was not found to significantly influence
   species richness, there was increased herb cover and reduced abundance
   of noxious weeds in the wider seeded margins.
   6.Synthesis and applications. The choice of establishment method and
   subsequent management of grassland field margins significantly affected
   their conservation value. The botanical diversity of margins within
   intensively managed pasture can be enhanced by sowing wildflower seed
   mixtures. This diversity can be maintained over time through appropriate
   management, i.e. either the reduction of high grazing pressure by
   seasonal fencing, or annual mowing. Management approaches that involve
   minimal change are currently adopted in many agri-environment schemes
   (such as fencing and/or the cessation of nutrient inputs) but did not
   produce swards of conservation value in this study.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new taxon of mylodontid sloth from the late Oligocene
   (Deseadan South American Land Mammal ``age{''}), Salla Beds of Bolivia.
   This taxon, Paroctodontotherium calleorum, new genus and species, is one
   of the oldest known sloths, but it is surprisingly derived. It is
   referable to the Mylodontidae and, with just a little doubt, to the
   Mylodontinae. It shares a number of derived characteristics with other
   mylodontids and even mylodontines. These include: a relatively low
   temporomandibular joint; a relatively short zygomatic process of the
   squamosal; an elongated, narrow braincase; anteriorly diverging
   toothrows; broad muzzle; and greatly enlarged external nares. The
   relative width of the muzzle of Paroctodontotherium is as great as any
   Pleistocene mylodontid except the giant grazer, Lestodon. We review and
   critique methods of estimating diets of extinct sloths and propose a
   hypothesis in regard to the feeding ecology of Paroctodontotherium.
   Based upon its broad muzzle, the degree of tooth wear, and its presence
   in a habitat dominated by hypsodont herbivores, we propose that
   Paroctodontotherium was a bulk feeder that foraged near ground level.
   Grasses were likely a major component of its diet. The addition of this
   new taxon, along with other recently discovered taxa, illustrates that
   late Oligocene sloths had much greater diversity than recognized just a
   decade ago. This diversity is evident in species richness, variations in
   body sizes, dental morphologies, and means of locomotion. We regard this
   relatively sudden sloth radiation as a significant component of the
   Eocene-Oligocene faunal turnover and was related to the development of
   more open habitats of post-Eocene South America.}},

Abstract = {{Vast grasslands are found in the walnut-fruit forest region of southern
   Kyrgyzstan, Middle Asia. Located above the worldwide unique walnut-fruit
   forests and used for grazing, they play a pivotal role in the mixed
   mountain agriculture of local farmers. Accordingly, these pastures are
   subject to an increasing utilization pressure reflecting the changing
   political and social conditions in the transformation process from a
   Soviet republic to an independent state. A first detailed analysis of
   mountain pasture vegetation in the Ferghana Range answers the following
   questions: What are the main plant community types among Kyrgyzstan's
   mountain pastures? What are the main environmental gradients that shape
   their species composition? Which phytogeographical distribution types
   are predominant? How does grazing affect community composition and
   species richness in these grasslands? Species composition was classified
   by cluster analysis; underlying environmental gradients were explored
   using DCA. A dataset of 395 relev,s was used for classification, and a
   subset of 79 relev,s was used in a DCA to analyze the correlation
   between vegetation, environment, and grazing impact. The investigated
   pastures were classified into four distinctive plant communities. The
   site factors altitude, heat load, inclination and grazing impact were
   found to be the major determinants of the vegetation pattern. A
   significant overlap between floristic composition and structural and
   spatial properties was shown. The majority of the species pool consisted
   of Middle Asian endemics and Eurosiberian species. However,
   disturbance-tolerant species played a significant role with respect to
   species composition and coverage of the herbaceous layer in vast areas
   of southern Kyrgyzstan's mountain pastures. In general, an intense
   grazing impact is clearly reflected by both species composition and
   structural variables of plant communities. The highly diverse and unique
   ecosystem is modified by an increasing utilization pressure. In order to
   maintain vital processes and functioning of this valuable ecosystem - in
   both economical and ecological terms -, it is indispensable to adopt
   appropriate pasture management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Question
   Can species richness be a predictor for above-ground biomass in natural
   grasslands at a regional scale?
   Location
   A total of 647 sites across temperate natural grasslands of northern
   China.
   Methods
   Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to examine the effect of
   species richness on above-ground biomass. Asymptotically
   distribution-free estimation was selected for parameter estimation. The
   SEM process was performed at five sample sizes (n=50, 100, 200, 300 and
   647). Spatial structure in the original data was examined by calculating
   Moran's I.
   Results
   SEM run at n=647 revealed a positive effect of species richness on
   above-ground biomass after controlling for the influences of bioclimatic
   factors and grazing. At the four reduced sample size levels, the
   positive effect held true for most cases in 400 observations (> 92\%).
   Conclusions
   Contrary to observations in previous studies in natural grasslands, our
   data showed a positive effect of species richness on above-ground
   biomass. This suggests that, as a short-term effect of diversity on
   productivity, niche complementarity among coexisting species tends to be
   an important process in arid and semi-arid natural grasslands. We hold
   that biodiversity conservation is among the fundamental approaches
   required to maintain productivity of grasslands in arid and semi-arid
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{Gavdopoula is an island of 177.5 ha in the S Aegean, near the
   southeasternmost point of Europe. Based on field excursions in 1998/99
   and 2009/10, we provide an annotated floristic catalogue of 186 vascular
   plant and 13 bryophyte taxa, with a full record of herbarium specimens
   and field observations, being the first botanical inventory of the
   island. Species richness in relation to island area is, as shown in a
   diagram, according to expectations. Among the vascular plants there are
   six regional ('Cretan area') endemics. The Saharo-Arabian-S
   Mediterranean phytogeographical element is well represented, with
   several species confined in Greece or even in Europe to the small
   islands south of Crete. Of these, Atriplex mollis occurs in Europe only
   on Gavdopoula. The moss Entosthodon commutatus has not previously been
   recorded from the E Mediterranean. The vegetation is controlled chiefly
   by the dry Mediterranean climate, calcareous shallow soils, sea spray
   and seasonal grazing. It consists of halo-nitrophytic and Pistacia
   lentiscus scrub, two types of phrygana, small-scale ephemeral pastures
   with winter-annuals on red-loamy soils, and sea-cliff vegetation. The
   new combination, Lysimachia arvensis var. caerulea, is published.}},

Title = {{Assessing the impact of understory vegetation cut on soil epigeic
   macrofauna from a cork-oak Montado in South Portugal}},

Volume = {{82}},

Abstract = {{Cork oak ``Montados{''} are a particular Mediterranean ecosystem, which
   can be found in Southern Portugal. Portuguese ``Montados{''} are
   man-made ecosystems, mainly used for cork production and cattle farming,
   that support a high biological diversity. Current sustainable management
   techniques imply a shrub clearing with heavy machinery, which can be
   highly disruptive for soil biota. In order to evaluate the effects of
   understory vegetation management on soil epigeic macrofauna, five zones
   were defined along a chronosequence of shrub clearing: a non-disturbed
   zone (zone 5) and zones where understory vegetation was cut at 4-5 years
   (zone 4), at 3-4 years (zone 3), at 2 years (zone 2) and at 1 year (zone
   1). A sixth zone (zone 6) was selected in a pasture, where cattle are
   occasionally present. Soil fauna was sampled using ``pitfall{''} traps
   and sampling took place in autumn 2003. A total of 2,677 individuals,
   separated into 152 species and morphospecies, were caught in the traps.
   With the exception of zone 6, that presented a lower number of species,
   all the other zones from the chronosequence presented, in most cases, a
   similar number of taxa, species diversity (Shannon) and species richness
   (Margalef). Multivariate analysis separated recently disturbed zones
   (plus zone 6) from those intervened at longer time; groups like
   Formicidae, Scydmaenidae, most families from Araneae and insect larvae
   appeared closely associated to zones 3-5 (with a higher shrub cover and
   thick litter layers), whereas, other Hymenoptera, Gastropda and most
   Coleoptera families, appeared associated to recently disturbed zones
   (zones 1 and 2) and to zone 6, characterized by a lower shrub cover and
   a lower accumulation of litter. This separation indicates that effects
   of the intervention can endure for 2 or 3 years. After that time, the
   normal natural regeneration of the understory vegetation seems to
   support the restoration of the macrofauna community, thus indicating
   that the sustainable management strategy adopted, i.e., making a shrub
   cut every 5-6 years, seems not induce a significant effect on local
   species richness of soil epigeic macrofauna.}},

Abstract = {{Although the loss of species is often attributed to reductions in
   habitat area, heterogeneity and connectivity, species specific traits
   and taxonomic relatedness can be important in explaining which species
   groups may be most impacted by the fragmentation process. In this study,
   using urban grassland fragments within the Front Range of northern
   Colorado, USA, we quantified the degree to which grasshopper species
   numbers declined with reductions in habitat area. We then examined the
   degree to which subfamily grouping (Gomphocerinae, Melanoplinae,
   Oedipodinae) and variation in life history characteristics (body size,
   dispersal ability, feeding preference and juvenile emergence time)
   explained which grasshopper species groups might be most impacted by
   reductions in habitat size. Our results showed a strong species-area
   relationship for grasshoppers across the urban fragments. Grasshoppers
   in different subfamily groupings were found to respond differentially,
   with the Melanoplinae being least affected by reductions in habitat
   area, while the other subfamilies responded similarly and lost species
   at a higher rate. Species with different feeding strategies were also
   found to respond differentially, with forbivorous species being least
   affected by the reductions in habitat area, while the graminivorous and
   herbivorous (mixed-feeders) responded similarly and lost species at a
   higher rate. As Melanoplinae tend to be forb feeders, this may partially
   explain why the subfamily was not as affected by the fragmentation
   process as the Gomphocerinae and Oedipodinae (who tend to be grass and
   mixed-feeders, respectively). Species that differed in body size and
   dispersal ability did not display differential responses to reductions
   in habitat area.}},

Abstract = {{Much information on restoration and management exists for wet tropical
   forests of Central America but comparatively little work has been done
   in the dry forests of this region. Such information is critical for
   reforestation efforts that are now occurring throughout Central America.
   This paper describes processes of degradation due to land use and
   provides a conceptual framework for the restoration of dry tropical
   forest. Most of this forest type was initially harvested for timber and
   then cleared for cattle in the last century (1930-1970). Only 1.7\%
   remains largely restricted to infertile soils and remote areas on the
   Pacific coastal side of Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Mexico. These
   cleared areas are again in a state of transition due to a combination of
   decreasing land productivity, and land speculation for tourism
   development. Some farms have been sold to new landowners who are
   interested in reforesting to increase biodiversity and forest cover.
   Attempts have therefore been made to reforest by protecting the land
   from fire and cattle, by supplementing natural regrowth with enrichment
   planting, or through use of tree plantations. Experimental studies have
   demonstrated the ability of these lands to grow back to forests because
   of native species ability to sprout after cutting, and the capacity of
   remnant trees in field and riparian zones to provide seeds and to
   moderate edge environment for seed germination and seedling
   establishment. However, research also shows that on sites with long
   histories of land clearance, species diversity will remain low with
   functional groups missing unless some active management occurs.
   Under-planting with late-successional native tree species can add
   structure and diversity; enrichment planting with large-fruited
   shade-intolerant species can initiate new islands of more diverse
   regeneration beneath their canopies: and plantings of fast-growing,
   nitrogen-fixing trees that provide light canopy shade can moderate the
   environment below, promoting regeneration establishment of
   late-successional species. Plantations are the only option for lands
   that have lost almost all remnants of native forest, and where soils and
   vegetation have changed to new states of structure and function.
   Conversion of pastures to tree plantations that can facilitate natural
   regeneration beneath them is appropriate when pastures are prone to fire
   and/or lack immediate seed sources nearby. After the grasses have been
   shaded out, natural recruitment can slowly occur over a 10-15 years
   period. Under-planting of shade-tolerant late-successional species can
   supplement species composition and structure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Extensive cattle production currently occupies more than 27\% of the
   rural landscapes in Latin America, and continues to expand. This
   activity, deeply rooted in the culture and rural economy of the region,
   requires an urgent transformation if it is to become both more efficient
   and environmentally friendly. Silvopastoral systems that incorporate
   native trees and shrubs are instrumental for the productive
   rehabilitation of cattle production and for biodiversity conservation in
   agricultural landscapes. We discuss research progress and adoption of
   intensive silvopastoral systems in Colombia and Mexico. Intensive
   silvopastoral systems (ISS) are a sustainable form of agroforestry for
   livestock production that combines fodder shrubs planted at high
   densities (more than 10,000 plants ha(-1)), trees and palms, and
   improved pastures. High stocking and the natural production of milk and
   meat in these systems are achieved through rotational grazing with
   electric fencing and a permanent supply of water for the cattle. While
   milk and meat production and cattle reproduction are enhanced,
   production costs decline as external inputs are replaced by natural
   processes related to fertility and biological control. We also discuss
   the importance of the ISS with native trees for climate change
   adaptation and mitigation, the barriers for their adoption, and how
   these have been successfully addressed using payment for environmental
   services, special credits and technical assistance. Finally, we
   highlight the need for enhancing landscape connectivity by integrating
   SPS to conservation corridors with native species to promote
   biodiversity conservation and other environmental services demanded by
   society. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Trees dispersed in pastures are a prominent feature of many Central
   American landscapes, particularly in cattle producing regions where
   farmers retain trees to serve as shade, fodder, timber and firewood. The
   presence of dispersed trees in pastures is often considered as important
   for the conservation of biodiversity by providing habitat and enhancing
   landscape connectivity. However, despite their critical productive and
   environmental roles, little is known about tree distribution within
   pastures or how farmers' management decisions influence the trees
   themselves and their impact on farm productivity and biodiversity
   conservation. Here, we present a synthesis of (a) the abundance,
   composition, and size of dispersed trees in four important cattle
   producing regions of Costa Rica (Canas and Rio Frio) and Nicaragua
   (Rivas and Matiguas), based on inventory of 18,669 trees on 1492 ha of
   pasture, (b) the local knowledge, management and use of trees by cattle
   farmers, and (c) opportunities for ensuring sustainable management of
   dispersed trees in pasture-dominated landscapes. Dispersed trees were
   common in all four landscapes, with mean frequency ranging from 8.0
   trees ha(-1) in Callas to 33.4 trees ha(-1) in Matiguas. A total of 255
   tree species were found in pastures across the four landscapes. The
   total number of tree species per landscape varied from 72 in Rivas to
   101 in Callas and Rio Frio, with mean species richness per farm ranging
   from 22.9 in Rio Frio to 45.9 in Matiguas. In all four landscapes, a
   handful of tree species dominated the pastures, with the ten most
   abundant species in each landscape accounting for >70\% of all trees
   recorded. Most of these common tree species provide fruits or foliage
   eaten by cattle, or are important timber or firewood species, and are
   deliberately retained by farmers for these uses. In all four landscapes,
   farmers had a detailed knowledge of tree attributes affecting pasture
   and animal productivity, and influenced tree cover through pasture
   management activities and occasional tree cutting. Current farm
   management practices are gradually decreasing the diversity of trees in
   pastures, and in some cases also tree density, reducing their
   contribution to farm productivity and biodiversity conservation. To
   reverse this trend, incentives are required to encourage cattle farmers
   to retain and enhance tree cover in pastures, through the adoption of
   pasture management practices that favor the regeneration and persistence
   of a diverse range of tree species. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Top-down control has been extensively documented in food webs based on
   living plants, where predator limitation of herbivores can cascade to
   facilitate plant growth (the green-world hypothesis), particularly in
   grasslands and aquatic systems. Yet the ecosystem role of predators in
   detrital food webs is less explored, as is the potential effect of
   climate warming on detritus-based communities. We here show that
   predators have a ``brown-world{''} role in decomposer communities via a
   cascading top-down control on plant growth, based on the results of an
   experiment that factorially manipulated presence and size of two
   predator species as well as temperature (warmed vs. unwarmed). The
   inclusion of predatory beetles significantly decreased abundance of
   coprophagous beetles and thus the rate of dung decomposition and
   productivity of plants growing surrounding the dung. Moreover, the
   magnitude of these decreases differed between predator species and, for
   dung loss, was temperature dependent. At ambient temperature, the larger
   predators tended to more strongly influence the dung loss rate than did
   the smaller predators; when both predators were present, the dung loss
   rate was higher relative to the treatments with the smaller predators
   but comparable to those with the larger ones, suggesting an antagonistic
   effect of predator interaction. However, warming substantially reduced
   dung decomposition rates and eliminated the effects of predation on dung
   decomposition. Although warming substantially decreased dung loss rates,
   warming only modestly reduced primary productivity. Consistent with
   these results, a second experiment exploring the influence of the two
   predator species and warming on dung loss over time revealed that
   predatory beetles significantly decreased the abundance of coprophagous
   beetles, which was positively correlated with dung loss rates. Moreover,
   experimental warming decreased the water content of dung and hence the
   survival of coprophagous beetles. These results confirm that the
   ``brown-world{''} effect of predator beetles was due to cascading
   top-down control through coprophagous beetles to nutrient cycling and
   primary productivity. Our results also highlight potentially
   counterintuitive effects of climate warming. For example, global warming
   might significantly decrease animal-mediated decomposition of organic
   matter and recycling of nutrients in a future warmed world.}},

Title = {{Interactive Effects of Fire and Nonnative Plants on Small Mammals in
   Grasslands}},
Journal = {{WILDLIFE MONOGRAPHS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Number = {{176}},
Pages = {{1-31}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Invasions by nonnative plants have changed the structure of many
   terrestrial ecosystems and altered important ecological processes such
   as fire, the dominant driver in grassland ecosystems. Reestablishing
   fire has been proposed as a mechanism to restore dominance of native
   plants in grasslands invaded by nonnative plants, yet fire may function
   differently in these altered systems, potentially affecting animals in
   novel ways. To assess whether invasions by nonnative plants alter the
   effects of fire on animals, we performed a manipulative experiment in
   semi-desert grasslands of southeastern Arizona that have been invaded by
   a perennial, nonnative grass from Africa, Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis
   lehmanniana). We applied fire to 36 of 54 1-ha plots established along
   an invasion gradient where dominance of E. lehmanniana ranged from 0\%
   to 91\% of total live plant biomass. Over the 5-year period from 2000 to
   2004, we used mark-recapture methods to assess how population and
   community attributes of small mammals varied along the gradient of
   nonnative grass and in response to fire. We quantified changes in
   presence of 17 species, abundance of 9 species, total abundance of all
   species combined, species richness, and species composition. Based on
   11,226 individual mammals from 24 species, we found that effects of
   nonnative-grass dominance varied with habitat preferences of each
   species, resulting in composition of the small-mammal community changing
   predictably along the invasion gradient. As dominance of nonnative grass
   increased, presence and abundance of granivorous heteromyids and
   insectivores (e. g., Chaetodipus, Perognathus, Onychomys; pocket mice
   and grasshopper mice) decreased, whereas presence and abundance of
   omnivorous and herbivorous murids (e. g., Reithrodontomys, Sigmodon;
   harvest mice and cotton rats) increased. Species richness of the
   small-mammal community averaged 8.4 species per plot and was highest at
   intermediate levels of nonnative-grass dominance where vegetation
   heterogeneity was greatest. Abundance of all small mammals combined
   averaged 26.9 individuals per plot and did not vary appreciably with
   nonnative-grass dominance. During the 4- to 8-week period immediately
   after fire, abundance of 6 of the 9 most common species changed, with 5
   species decreasing and 1 species increasing on burned plots relative to
   unburned plots. During this same time period, species richness of small
   mammals decreased by an average of 3 species (38\%) and total abundance
   of all species combined decreased by an average of 16 individuals (61\%)
   on burned plots relative to unburned plots. Effects of fire on
   vegetation biomass, on presence of 9 of 17 mammalian species, and on
   abundance of 4 of 9 mammalian species remained evident >= 2 years after
   fire. Effects of fire on most small-mammal species varied with the
   degree of nonnative-grass dominance, suggesting that fire functioned
   differently in areas invaded by nonnative plants relative to areas
   dominated by native plants. Specifically, effects of fire on presence of
   12 of 14 species and abundance of 7 of 9 species varied along the
   gradient of E. lehmanniana. During this post-fire period, however,
   composition of the small-mammal community in areas dominated by
   nonnative grass transitioned towards composition of areas dominated by
   native grasses, suggesting that fires had some restorative effect on
   habitat for small mammals. The relative strength of this effect will
   likely depend in general on the structural and compositional contrasts
   between invaded and native plant communities.
   Despite the reported neffectiveness of fire at reducing dominance of
   nonnative plants, restoring fire to grasslands invaded by nonnative
   plants can help maintain the mosaic of vegetation conditions necessary
   to support the diverse assemblage of animals that inhabit these
   fire-governed ecosystems. (C) 2011 The Wildlife Society.}},

Abstract = {{Western Himalayan alpine pastures are among the most diverse ecological
   locations on the globe. Four alpine pastures were investigated to study
   species distribution patterns, richness, similarity, and community
   structure in Bagh District, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. Four communities,
   Poa-Primula-Sibbaldia, Primula-Caltha-Primula, Poa alpina-Poa
   pratensis-Scirpus, and Sibbaldia-Poa-Scirpus, were identified on the
   basis of an importance value index. The average value of species
   richness was 1.42; Simpson's and Shannon-Wiener's diversity values were
   3.13 and 0.91, respectively; the degree of maturity index was 44.1; and
   species evenness was 0.901. Local alpine flora was dominated by a
   hemicriptophytic life form with microphyllous leaf spectra. The
   species-environment correlation was analyzed using canonical
   correspondence analysis. A negative correlation of both diversity and
   richness was revealed with altitudinal gradient. Anthropogenic
   disturbances showed a significant negative impact on distribution of
   medicinal and palatable species. Unpalatable species dominated the local
   flora, indicating the heavy grazing pressure in the area. Development
   and implementation of regional conservation strategies are recommended
   to protect the threatened Himalayan alpine biodiversity.}},

Volume = {{64}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Prairies exhibit a bimodal frequency distribution of patch occupancy
   with a few dominant species accounting for most of the primary
   production and plant biomass and numerous other species occurring
   infrequently over time and space. Consequently, management interest is
   often focused on the abundance of common species, and on the persistence
   of less common species. We used spatially nested arrays of various sized
   plots to simultaneously measure species' persistence and abundance at
   Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve, Kansas. Larger plots captured more
   species, with 127 species identified at the 10-m scale. Smaller plots,
   however, provided useful frequency data for measuring the abundance of
   common species. We defined a plot frame size that delivers a frequency
   in a 20-50\% target range as the optimal plot size, and the frequency of
   a species sampled at its optimal plot size is termed the optimized
   frequency. Optimized frequency was estimated for 27 common species for
   the years 2002-2006. Of the nine perennial grasses in this group, five
   exhibited significant interannual variation within the 5-yr period.
   Bouteloua curtipendula exhibited a significant linear change over the
   5-yr period, decreasing in frequency over time. From year to year,
   changes in optimized frequency among the 27 common species varied in
   both their trajectory (i.e., the average change), and amplitude (i.e.,
   the average magnitude of change). Between 2005 and 2006, the average
   change in optimized frequency was -9.1\%, the only year with an overall
   declining trajectory. The declining trajectory between 2005 and 2006 was
   significantly different from the increasing trajectories observed
   between 2002 and 2003 and between 2004 and 2005. No significant
   differences were observed in amplitude. We offer these techniques for
   aggregating information from multiple spatial scales to characterize the
   amplitude and trajectory of community-wide changes as tools to help
   scientists convey the results of multiscale research projects to land
   managers.}},

Abstract = {{Terpene composition of ewes' raw milk from nine commercial flocks was
   analysed from February to July. Ewes' diet consisted of concentrate and
   conserved forage in winter (indoor feeding) and part-time grazing from
   spring (transition and outdoor feeding). Regardless of the feeding,
   limonene and beta-phellandrene were the most abundant monoterpenes and
   beta-caryophyllene showed the highest concentrations among
   sesquiterpenes. Terpene content increased in the milks of commercial
   flocks when animals were reared under grazing management. Monoterpenes
   were detected in the milks of all the commercial flocks throughout the
   season, whereas sesquiterpenes were only detected in the milks from
   flocks grazing on non-cultivated community-owned grasslands in which a
   higher biodiversity of plant species grew. These preliminary results
   indicated that beta-caryophyllene could be a potential pasture-diet
   marker in the case of milks from animals grazing a higher biodiversity
   of plant species but in-depth studies including information on terpene
   composition of plants ingested by the animals are necessary to evaluate
   the suitability of beta-caryophyllene or another terpenoid compound as

Abstract = {{Herbivores influence nutrient cycling either through direct effects
   (e.g. excreta) or through indirect effects such as a modification of
   plant-soil feedbacks. This work investigated if grazing-enhanced net N
   mineralization rates were related to (1) enhanced quality of plant
   litter and/or (2) reduced plant litter inputs. Rates of net N
   mineralization in soil and both the quantity and quality of litters were
   characterized in various plant patches occurring within a grazed
   grassland. Soil incubations were performed in controlled conditions to
   assess the respective role of litter quantity and quality on N
   mineralization.
   In laboratory incubations, the effect of litter quantity on net N
   mineralization rates was found to depend on litter quality. High inputs
   of litter produced by grazing-promoted species (C/N 11) stimulated net N
   mineralization rates, while high inputs of litter produced by
   grazing-reduced species (C/N 46) decreased rates of net N
   mineralization. The intensity of either the negative or positive effects
   of litter was then regulated by litter quantity. In the field, litter
   quality only varied within a limited range. Litter with the highest
   quality in the field (C/N 22) increased N mineralization minimally
   compared to the lowest quality litter (C/N 46). Grazing-induced
   variations in litter quality monitored in the field thus appeared
   unlikely to cause measured variations in net N mineralization rates.
   Litter with C/N ratios of 46 and 22 stimulated N immobilization and
   reduction of their inputs increased the rate of N mineralization due to
   decreased microbial N immobilization. Within-grassland variations of
   litter quantity were large and negatively correlated with net N
   mineralization rates. Our results support the hypothesis that
   grazing-induced patchiness modifies net N mineralization rates by
   controlling microbial N immobilization mainly through changes in the
   quantity of litter-C supplied to the soil. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Volume = {{107}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Background and Aims The biological mechanisms of niche complementarity
   allowing for a stable coexistence of a large number of species in a
   plant community are still poorly understood. This study investigated how
   small-statured forbs use environmental niches in light and CO2 to
   explain their persistence in diverse temperate grasslands.
   Methods Light and CO2 profiles and the corresponding leaf
   characteristics of seven small-statured forbs were measured in
   monocultures and a multi-species mixture within a biodiversity
   experiment (Jena Experiment) to assess their adjustment to growth
   conditions in the canopy.
   Key Results Environmental conditions near the ground varied throughout
   the season with a substantial CO2 enrichment (> 70 mu mol mol(-1) at 2
   cm > 20 mu mol mol(-1) at 10 cm above soil surface) and a decrease in
   light transmittance (to < 5\% deep in the canopy) with large standing
   biomass (> 500 g d. wt m(-2)) in the multi-species assemblage. Leaf
   morphology, biochemistry and physiology of small-statured forbs adjusted
   to low light in the mixture compared with the monocultures. However, the
   net carbon assimilation balance during the period of low light only
   compensated the costs of maintenance respiration, while CO2 enrichment
   near the ground did not allow for additional carbon gain. Close
   correlations of leaf mass per area with changes in light availability
   suggested that small-statured forbs are capable of adjusting to exploit
   seasonal niches with better light supply for growth and to maintain the
   carbon metabolism for survival if light transmittance is substantially
   reduced in multi-species assemblages.
   Conclusions This study shows that adjustment to a highly dynamic light
   environment is most important for spatial and seasonal niche separation
   of small-statured forb species in regularly mown, species-rich
   grasslands. The utilization of short-period CO2 enrichment developing in
   dense vegetation close to the ground hardly improves their carbon
   balance and contributes little to species segregation along
   environmental niche axes.}},

Title = {{Niche overlap reveals the effects of competition, disturbance and
   contrasting assembly processes in experimental grassland communities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{788-796}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Understanding the processes by which species sort themselves into
   communities remains a central puzzle for attempts to maintain
   biodiversity. It remains unclear whether any single assembly process is
   generally dominant or whether the influence of contrasting processes
   varies in a predictable way relative to biotic and abiotic gradients.
   Abundance-weighted niche overlap between species provides a powerful
   means of contrasting two major assembly processes - niche
   complementarity and environmental filtering.
   2. We examined mean overlap for four vegetative functional traits,
   relative to that expected when abundances were randomly allocated to
   species co-occurring in experimental plots in a wet meadow. This
   provided a test of whether any single assembly process prevailed for the
   meadow as a whole and across all traits. The effects of mowing,
   fertilization and dominant species removal, and associated gradients of
   Simpson's dominance and biomass on the niche overlap of plots, were also
   examined.
   3. Niche overlap was higher than expected at random for three of the
   four traits studied (height, leaf and stem dry matter content, leaf C:N
   ratio). However, niche overlap was lower than expected for specific leaf
   area.
   4. Mowing was the treatment with the greatest effect on both niche
   overlap and biomass, with overlap significantly lower in the absence of
   mowing for three of the traits, while biomass was lower in mown plots.
   For three of the traits there was evidence of a significant decrease in
   overlap with increasing biomass, but not increasing dominance. None of
   the significant mowing effects on overlap remained when the effect of
   biomass had been removed.
   5. Synthesis: These results suggest that the importance of niche
   differences between species in structuring grassland communities should
   increase with increasing biomass and decrease with disturbance in
   grassland communities. They also emphasize that contrasting community
   assembly processes may occur for different niche axes, even within a
   single community.}},

Abstract = {{Grazing management is probably one of the most extensive land uses, but
   its effects on plant communities have in many cases been revealed to be
   contradictory. Some authors have related these contradictions to the
   stochastic character of grazing systems. Because of that, it is
   necessary to implement specific analyses of grazing effects on each
   community, especially in natural protected areas, in order to provide
   the best information to managers.
   We studied the effects of grazing on the species composition of the main
   vegetation types where it takes place (grasslands, shrublands and pine
   forests) on the island of La Palma, Canary Islands. We used the
   point-quadrat intersect method to study the species composition of
   grazed and ungrazed areas, which also were characterized by their
   altitude, distance to farms, distance to settlements, year of sampling,
   herbaceous aboveground biomass and soil organic matter.
   The variables organic matter, productivity and species richness were not
   significantly affected by grazing. The species composition of the
   analyzed plant communities was affected more by variables such as
   altitude or distance to farms than by extensive grazing that has been
   traditionally carried out on the island of La Palma involving certain
   practices such as continuous monitoring of animals by goat keepers,
   medium stocking rates adjusted to the availability of natural pastures,
   supplementation during the dry season using local forage shrubs or mown
   pastures and rotating animals within grazing areas
   Although some studies have shown a negative effect of grazing on
   endangered plant species, these results cannot be freely extrapolated to
   the traditional grazing systems that exert a low pressure on plant
   communities (as has been found in this study). We consider extensive
   grazing as a viable way of ensuring sustainable management of the
   studied ecosystems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The regeneration potential of grazing-affected Nama Karoo vegetation was
   evaluated by comparing soil seed banks of different microsites across a
   fence-line contrast in arid Namibia. Seed banks under low and high
   grazing pressure reflected the condition of the standing vegetation in
   terms of composition, community structure and species abundance
   distributions. However, a close concordance between vegetation and seed
   bank was restricted to the herbaceous and grassy vegetation within the
   inter-shrub matrix.
   The divergence of seed bank communities across the fence-line was low at
   community level but high at the level of species abundances. Continuous
   severe grazing increased the abundance of small-seeded, prostrate forbs
   with round seeds and favored unpalatable, annual grasses over palatable,
   perennial grasses. Microsites provided a source of small-scale variation
   in seed bank community composition and were dissimilar between the
   rangelands.
   Results indicated an advanced divergence in the vegetation at the
   degraded site with seed banks of species common under sustainable
   grazing being drastically reduced. Their low abundance, even in safe
   sites, suggests that long-distance dispersal is one of the main limiting
   factors for natural re-establishment after disturbance. The inertia in
   recovery of Namibian degraded rangelands through seed limitation can be
   overcome only by active species introduction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Alternative states of a semiarid grassland ecosystem: implications for
   ecosystem services}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Ecosystems can shift between alternative states characterized by
   persistent differences in structure, function, and capacity to provide
   ecosystem services valued by society. We examined empirical evidence for
   alternative states in a semiarid grassland ecosystem where topographic
   complexity and contrasting management regimes have led to spatial
   variations in levels of livestock grazing. Using an inventory data set,
   we found that plots (n = 72) cluster into three groups corresponding to
   generalized alternative states identified in an a priori conceptual
   model. One cluster (biocrust) is notable for high coverage of a
   biological soil crust functional group in addition to vascular plants.
   Another (grass-bare) lacks biological crust but retains perennial
   grasses at levels similar to the biocrust cluster. A third
   (annualized-bare) is dominated by invasive annual plants. Occurrence of
   grass-bare and annualized-bare conditions in areas where livestock have
   been excluded for over 30 years demonstrates the persistence of these
   states. Significant differences among all three clusters were found for
   percent bare ground, percent total live cover, and functional group
   richness. Using data for vegetation structure and soil erodibility, we
   also found large among-cluster differences in average levels of dust
   emissions predicted by a wind-erosion model. Predicted emissions were
   highest for the annualized-bare cluster and lowest for the biocrust
   cluster, which was characterized by zero or minimal emissions even under
   conditions of extreme wind. Results illustrate potential trade-offs
   among ecosystem services including livestock production, soil retention,
   carbon storage, and biodiversity conservation. Improved understanding of
   these trade-offs may assist ecosystem managers when evaluating
   alternative management strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition has been identified as a major
   threat to biodiversity, but field surveys of its effects have rarely
   focussed on sites which are actively managed to maintain characteristic
   species. We analysed permanent quadrat data from 106 plots in nature
   reserves on calcareous grassland sites in the United Kingdom collected
   during a survey between 1990 and 1993 and compared the data with the
   results from resurvey of 48 of these plots between 2006 and 2009. N
   deposition showed no significant spatial association with species
   richness, species diversity, or the frequency of species adapted to low
   nutrient conditions in the 1990-1993 dataset. However, temporal analysis
   showed that N deposition was significantly associated with changes in
   Shannon diversity and evenness. In plots with high rates of N
   deposition, there was a decrease in species diversity and evenness, a
   decline in the frequency of characteristic calcareous grassland species,
   and a lower number of rare and scarce species. As all sites had active
   management to maintain a high diversity and characteristic species, our
   results imply that even focussed management on nature conservation
   objectives cannot prevent adverse effects of high rates of N deposition.
   Structural equation modelling was used to compare different causal
   mechanisms to explain the observed effects. For change in Shannon
   diversity, direct effects of N deposition were the dominant mechanism
   and there was an independent effect of change in grazing intensity. In
   contrast, for change in herb species number, indirect effects on soil
   acidity, linked to both N and S deposition, were more important than
   direct effects of N deposition.}},

Title = {{Ecosystem engineering and predation: the multi-trophic impact of two ant
   species}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{80}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{P>1. Ants are ubiquitous ecosystem engineers and generalist predators
   and are able to affect ecological communities via both pathways. They
   are likely to influence any other terrestrial arthropod group either
   directly or indirectly caused by their high abundance and
   territoriality.
   2. We studied the impact of two ant species common in Central Europe,
   Myrmica rubra and Lasius niger, on an arthropod community. Colony
   presence and density of these two ant species were manipulated in a
   field experiment from the start of ant activity in spring to late
   summer.
   3. The experiment revealed a positive influence of the presence of one
   ant colony on densities of decomposers, herbivores and parasitoids.
   However, in the case of herbivores and parasitoids, this effect was
   reversed in the presence of two colonies.
   4. Generally, effects of the two ant species were similar with the
   exception of their effect on Braconidae parasitoid densities that
   responded positively to one colony of M. rubra but not of L. niger.
   5. Spider density was not affected by ant colony manipulation, but
   species richness of spiders responded positively to ant presence. This
   effect was independent of ant colony density, but where two colonies
   were present, spider richness was significantly greater in plots with
   two M. rubra colonies than in plots with one colony of each ant species.
   6. To test whether the positive ecosystem engineering effects were
   purely caused by modified properties of the soil, we added in an
   additional experiment (i) the soil from ant nests (without ants) or (ii)
   unmodified soil or (iii) ant nests (including ants) to experimental
   plots. Ant nest soil on its own did not have a significant impact on
   densities of decomposers, herbivores or predators, which were
   significantly, and positively, affected by the addition of an intact
   nest.
   7. The results suggest an important role of both ant species in the
   grassland food web, strongly affecting the densities of decomposers,
   herbivores and higher trophic levels. We discuss how the relative impact
   via bottom-up and top-down effects of ants depends on nest density, with
   a relatively greater top-down predatory impact at higher densities.}},

Abstract = {{Climate and grazing are the main drivers of plant community composition
   and species richness in arid environments. This study aimed to examine
   the vegetation response to a spatial precipitation gradient, interannual
   rainfall variability, and grazing pressure in Mongolia. To examine the
   effect of a spatial precipitation gradient, we compared species richness
   among six sites. To investigate the effects of interannual rainfall
   variability and grazing pressure, we compared species richness for 2
   years at two sites, in desert-steppe and steppe areas. The regional
   gradient in annual precipitation showed positive and negative
   relationships with grass richness and shrub richness, respectively,
   although total species richness did not vary significantly. The
   proportions of the different functional groups were affected by grazing
   pressure and rainfall variability in both zones. In the desert-steppe
   zone, species richness was lower in the drier year but did not vary with
   grazing pressure. In the steppe zone, species richness varied
   significantly with grazing pressure but did not vary between years.
   Precipitation would be more important than grazing pressure on
   vegetation changes in drier areas with high rainfall variability. (C)

Title = {{A climatically extreme year has large impacts on C-4 species in
   tallgrass prairie ecosystems but only minor effects on species richness

Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{P>1. The occurrence and intensity of climate extremes, such as extremely
   warm years, are expected to continue to increase with increasing
   tropospheric radiative forcing caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas
   emissions.
   2. Responses of terrestrial ecosystem processes and services - such as
   above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) and maintenance of plant
   species diversity - to these extreme years for multiple years
   post-perturbation are poorly understood but can have significant
   feedback effects on net ecosystem CO2 uptake and ecosystem carbon
   sequestration.
   3. We exposed six 12 000-kg intact natural tallgrass prairie monoliths
   to an extremely warm year (+4 degrees C in 2003) in the second year of a
   4-year study (2002-2005) using the EcoCELL whole-ecosystem
   controlled-environment, gas exchange facility. Six control monoliths
   were not warmed in the second year but were maintained under average
   field conditions. Natural diel and seasonal patterns in air temperature
   were maintained in both treatments throughout the study. Thus, with the
   exception of the second year in the `warmed' treatment, we created 4
   years of nearly identical climate in all EcoCELLs.
   4. Interannual ANPP (10 cm clipping height) responses of the entire
   plant community to the extreme year were largely determined by responses
   of the dominant C-4 grasses. These included large decreases in ANPP in
   2003 followed by complete recovery to levels observed in the control
   ecosystems in the year following warming. Species richness and
   productivity of the nitrogen-fixing plant functional group appeared to
   play a role in defining overall plant community ANPP, however, even
   though this richness and productivity could not explain the decrease in
   community ANPP observed in warmed ecosystems in the second year (2003)
   of the study or its recovery in the year after (2004). Surprisingly,
   very few of the 67 species present in plant communities during the
   4-year study responded to the warm year at any time during or after the
   treatment.
   5. Synthesis. Results from this study indicate that as extreme climate
   years become more prevalent, their immediate and lagged impacts on
   collective ecosystem processes, such as whole-community ANPP, may be
   very pronounced, but effects on component ecosystem processes may be
   limited to the dominant plant functional group (ANPP).}},

Abstract = {{Since the 1950s, agricultural intensification has affected the structure
   and functioning of ecological systems including wet grasslands. Our
   study site, a wet grassland near TA (TM) eboA, Czech Republic, was
   historically a sedge meadow, but increased nutrient additions, a
   long-lasting flood in 2002 and changed mowing patterns resulted in
   domination by Phalaris arundinacea. The aim of the study was to
   determine how different nutrient conditions may affect plant structure
   and production in a wet grassland used for hay production. Species
   composition and percent cover were determined from line intercepts.
   Aboveground biomass was harvested six times each in 2007 and 2008 and
   primary production then calculated. Ingrowth core bags were used to
   determine belowground production. Aboveground production was two times
   greater in the high nutrient versus the low nutrient area in both years,
   while belowground production was very similar. The high nutrient area
   was still dominated by P. arundinacea, but Carex gracilis was now a
   co-dominant in the low nutrient area. However, other factors, such as
   water level and mowing regime, may interact with nutrient level to
   govern wet grassland structure and function.}},

Abstract = {{Plant functional types across environmental gradients can be considered
   as a powerful proxy that reveals vegetation-environment relationships.
   The objectives of this study were to investigate the response in the
   relative abundance of plant functional types along altitudinal gradients
   and to examine the relationship of plant functional types to
   environmental variables. The study was conducted in the Gughe-Amaro
   Mountains, in the south-west Ethiopian highlands. We established 74
   plots with an area of 400 m(2) (20 x 20 m) each along altitudinal ranges
   between 1000 and 3000 m asl. Data on site environmental conditions and
   on the abundance of plant functional types were analysed using the
   constrained linear ordination technique (RDA) in order to identify the
   relationships between plant functional types and environmental
   variables. Altitude, soil organic carbon, soil sand fraction and surface
   stone cover were significantly related to the relative abundance of
   plant functional types across the gradient. Tussocks and thorns/spines
   were abundant in lower altitudinal ranges in response to herbivory and
   drought while rhizomes and rosettes were abundant at higher altitudes in
   response to the cold. Generally our results show that topographic
   attributes (altitude and slope) as well as soil organic carbon play an
   important role in differentiating the relative abundance of plant
   functional types in the investigated gradient. Thus, considering
   specific plant functional types would provide a better understanding of
   the ecological patterns of vegetation and their response to
   environmental gradients in tropical regions of Africa prone to drought.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this research was to study the floristic and ecological
   changes in sub-Mediterranean meadows due to three kinds of management
   entailing different disturbance intensities. The theoretic framework
   follows Grime's theory about the correlation between species richness
   and disturbance intensities. Phytosociological releves were carried out
   in three different management-disturbance situations, namely mowing and
   grazing, mowing alone, and abandonment. The data from these releves were
   processed through statistical analysis, and examined together with
   ecological parameters (bioindication values and twenty functional plant
   traits) in order to indicate significant differences within the
   diversely disturbed meadows. It was found that three identified plant
   communities corresponded to three different disturbance intensities, and
   that species richness was comparable between high disturbance situation
   and those of void disturbance, whilst it considerably decreased under
   intermediate disturbance. High disturbance condition vs. void
   disturbance comparison showed the higher differences regarding: species
   turnover (57\% of Sorensen similarity index and 45 differential
   species), light request and pH soil reaction. Hemicryptophytes, fringe
   social behaviour type (SBT3), upright forbs, clonal ability, late
   flowering period emerged as differential traits and species height
   increases moving to undisturbed situation. Other important evidences
   concern avoidance strategies which are favoured by mowing and grazing,
   whereas species equipped with late flowering period and clonal ability
   are advantaged under intermediate and void disturbance conditions. Our
   findings indicated that the species more threatened by abandonment are
   the accidental ones.}},

Abstract = {{Cities contain only a low representation of natural and semi-natural
   habitats, existing in fragments surrounded by built-up areas. In
   2003-2004, we surveyed butterflies and Zygaenidae moths in 21 reserves
   and 4 parks within the city of Prague, Czech Republic, situated from the
   periphery to city centre. A total of 85 species (47\% of the Czech fauna
   of the study groups) was detected, 22 of them being of conservation
   concern. Ordination analyses of the local assemblages revealed that the
   richest sites were large, situated far from the city centre, on alkaline
   bedrocks, south- to southwest oriented, and hosting high numbers of
   vegetation types and vascular plant species. We then used generalised
   linear models to fit responses of individual species to the main
   ordination gradient, corresponding to increasing urbanisation. Out of 60
   species that met criteria for the modelling, none responded positively
   to urbanisation. Twenty displayed negative linear response; these urban
   avoiders contained a surplus of mesophilous species presumably
   preferring rural landscapes. Further 29 species (suburban adaptable)
   responded in domed manners, peaking at the city periphery. Prevailing
   among them were xerophilous specialists inhabiting large grassland
   reserves at the Prague outskirts. Finally, eleven urban tolerant species
   did not respond to urbanisation at all, containing three highly mobile
   species, three xerothermophilous specialists, and five species utilising
   shrubs or trees and finding suitable conditions even in urban parks.
   Suburban adaptable butterflies apparently benefit from such suburban
   environments as gardens, road or railway verges, collectively increasing
   the connectivity of remnants of seminatural habitats. The fact that
   arboreal species persist even in urban parks, whereas common grassland
   species are absent there, implies that the quality of urban habitats
   might be increased by a more sensitive management of urban green spaces,
   such as leaving aside small temporary fallows or adapting lawns mowing
   schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Biodiversity of Khunjerab National Park (KNP) was carried out during May
   and June, 2006 to establish baseline information about existing plant
   wealth and wildlife including flora, reptiles, birds and mammals in
   order to make some vantage points for future monitoring of key wildlife
   species. Using different direct and indirect investigation techniques,
   14 different valleys and Nullahs of KNP were surveyed and observations
   on various habitats were recorded. Four types of vegetation zones were
   identified including Dry Alpine Scrub, Moist Alpine Pastures, Dry Alpine
   Plateau Pastures and Sub Alpine Scrub and Birch Forests. So far, 62
   plant species belonging to 45 genera and 25 families were identified. Of
   them, 4 grasses and one species of Liliaceae were determined. The most
   important family that contributed in floristic composition of this
   project area was Primulaceae (11.29\%), followed by Asteraceae (9.68\%),
   Boraginaceae (6.45\%), Brassicacea (6.45\%), Poaceae (6.45\%) and
   Rosaceae (6.45\%); whereas, rest of the families had fewer species. The
   animal diversity includes two reptilian, 46 avian and 25 mammalian
   species. In addition, 16 faunal species (two reptilian, 13 avian and one
   mammalian) were recorded for the first time from the study area. For
   observing wildlife and future studies in KNP, 18 vantage points were
   marked in different valleys and Nullahs and threats to different
   wildlife species were studied as poisoning the carnivores, illegal
   hunting, over grazing and food competitions through domesticated
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Highly variable effects of legumes have been observed in biodiversity
   experiments, but little is known about plant diversity effects on N-2
   fixation of legume species. We used the N-15 natural abundance method in
   a non-fertilized regularly mown 6-year biodiversity experiment (Jena
   Experiment) to quantify N-2 fixation of 12 legume species. The
   proportion of legume N derived from the atmosphere (\%N-dfa) differed
   significantly among legume species. \%N-dfa values were lower in 2004
   after setting-up the experiment (73 +/- 20) than in the later years
   (2006: 80 +/- 16; 2008: 78 +/- 12). Increasing species richness had
   positive effects on \%N-dfa in 2004 and 2006, but not in 2008. High
   biomass production of legumes in 2004 and 2006 declined to lower levels
   in 2008. In 2006, legume positioning within the canopy best explained
   variation in \%N-dfa values indicating a lower reliance of tall legumes
   on N-2 fixation. In 2008, larger \%N-dfa values of legumes were related
   to lower leaf P concentrations suggesting that the availability of
   phosphorus limited growth of legumes. In summary, diversity effects on
   N-2 fixation depend on legume species identity, their ability to compete
   for soil nutrients and light and may vary temporally in response to
   changing resource availability.}},

Abstract = {{St. John's wort, Hypericum perforatum, was a serious weed in New Zealand
   (NZ) pastures in the 1930s. Following successful biological control of
   the weed in Australia, two agents, the chrysomelid beetles Chrysolina
   hyperici and C. quadrigemina, were introduced to NZ in 1943 and 1965,
   respectively. At the time, the Australian host specificity testing,
   which had not included other Hypericum spp., was deemed sufficient for
   approval for release in NZ. We reviewed worldwide reports which suggest
   that St. John's wort beetles will attack a range of Hypericum species in
   the field. A series of laboratory tests were conducted to simulate
   modern host-range-testing protocols. Larval feeding choice, larval
   development and female oviposition choice all suggested that at least
   two of NZ's indigenous Hypericum species were suitable hosts for the two
   Chrysolina species, and a third indigenous Hypericum, while an
   unsuitable host, was not altogether avoided. We conclude that the two
   Chrysolina species would not have been approved for introduction to NZ
   under current risk assessment protocols. Had this happened, NZ would
   have missed out on one of its greatest biocontrol success stories,
   despite there being no evidence for subsequent impacts on the
   populations of indigenous congeners. This case stresses the need for
   better procedures to predict the realized host-range of an agent from
   the potential range in contained host-range testing, and raises issues
   surrounding risks and benefits to indigenous biodiversity. (C) 2011

Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1254-1264}},

Abstract = {{Recent expansion of industrial-scale plantations into agricultural areas
   in Australia has the potential to assist biodiversity conservation by
   rehabilitating ecosystems at the landscape scale and reducing edge
   effects, isolation and disturbance within remnants of native vegetation.
   However, the efficient management of remnants for biodiversity within a
   plantation estate requires knowledge of both the causes and the
   consequences of remnant degradation. With this in mind, we examined key
   ecosystem features and processes relating to soil chemistry,
   decomposition, native tree health and regeneration and vertebrate
   abundance, within small forest remnants (1-4 ha) embedded within
   Eucalyptus globulus plantations in south west Western Australia. Soil
   nutrient enrichment was significantly associated with a scale of
   vegetation modification in order from: (1) intact forest, (2) remnants
   with native understorey (UDN), (3) remnants with exotic understorey
   (UDE), (4) plantation and (5) pasture. We propose that, in this region.
   UDE remnants will often remain in a degraded state even after plantation
   establishment and the cessation of stock grazing. This is due, in part,
   to more rapid rates of nutrient turnover sustaining higher nutrient
   availability in the soil following the replacement of ligneous
   understorey plants with annual ones. Cotton strips placed in surface
   soils were often disintegrated in UDE remnants and largely intact in UDN
   remnants, indicating that decomposition was accelerated in the former.
   Continued tree decline and regeneration failure within UDE remnants will
   also reinforce the UDE condition. There was less canopy seed set and
   little or no seedling establishment in UDE remnants compared to UDN
   remnants. Therefore, management interventions to assist native tree
   regeneration in UDE remnants are needed. Fauna trapping highlighted the
   desirability of retaining, and preferably restoring, small remnants in
   plantations. Small native mammals were found exclusively in remnants and
   fewer introduced Mus musculus were present in UDN remnants. Higher
   numbers of native lizards were found in UDN remnants, but this result
   was not significant (marginally). (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Impacts of an aggressive riparian invader on community structure and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{443-452}},

Abstract = {{P>1. Bioassessment in running waters has focused primarily on the
   impacts of organic pollution on community structure. Other stressors
   (e.g. invasive species) and impacts on ecosystem processes have been
   largely ignored in many riverine biomonitoring schemes, despite being
   required increasingly by environmental legislation.
   2. Exotic riparian plants can exert potentially powerful stresses by
   altering both autochthonous and allochthonous trophic pathways. We
   examined the impact of Rhododendron ponticum on community structure and
   three key ecosystem processes (decomposition, primary production, and
   herbivory) in nine streams bordered by three characteristic vegetation
   types (deciduous woodland, pasture, or Rhododendron).
   3. Community structure and ecosystem process rates differed among
   vegetation types, with autochthonous pathways being relatively more
   important in the pasture streams than in the woodland reference streams.
   Overall ecosystem functioning, however, was compromised in the invaded
   streams because both allochthonous and autochthonous inputs were
   impaired. Rhododendron's poor quality litter and densely shaded canopy
   suppressed decomposition rates and algal production, and the
   availability of resources to consumer assemblages.
   4. Synthesis and applications. Combining measures of invertebrate
   abundance, rates of litter decomposition and algal production in future
   bioassessments of stream ecosystem functioning can help to make better
   informed management decisions and to develop more focused priorities for
   mediating the negative effects of riparian invasions. We provide a
   series of specific recommendations for dealing with invasive riparian
   plants in general, and Rhododendron in particular, in order to minimize
   their impacts on stream ecosystems. For instance, where the invader
   produces poor quality litter the canopy should be kept as open as
   possible over the stream channel to reduce impacts on algal production,
   thereby retaining alternative food chains that can be exploited by
   generalist consumers in the absence of viable detrital resources.}},

Volume = {{174}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recent literature confirmed that P fractions in soil are controlled by
   land use. However, differences in intensity of the same type of land use
   have received less attention although management intensity plays a
   crucial role in determining nutrient supply in soil. The objective of
   our work was to assess the influence of land-use intensity (LUI) on P
   fractions in soil. In the ``Biodiversity Exploratories{''}, grassland
   and forest sites in Germany were selected in three regions
   (Schorfheide-Chorin, Hainich-Dun, Schwabische Alb). In spring 2008, we
   sampled topsoil of 241 experimental plots. The plots included
   unfertilized and fertilized meadows, pastures, and mown pastures and
   near-natural to intensively used forests. Land-use intensity was
   classified according to the extent of annual biomass removal. We used
   the sequential extraction method of Hedley et al. (1982) to characterize
   P partitioning in soil. In summary, total P (TP) concentrations in soil
   were lowest at Schorfheide-Chorin (62-952 mg kg(-1)) followed by the
   Hainich-Dun (230-1631 mg kg(-1)) and the Schwabische Alb (205-1838 mg
   kg(-1)). Differences between grassland and forest sites were mainly
   attributable to pH. The pH value was the most important factor among
   several soil properties explaining P partitioning in soil. For
   grassland, at pH values approximate to 6.5, the application of
   lime-containing fertilizer increased P availability in soil while
   effects of organic or mineral P fertilizers were negligible and related
   to the low application rates (< 12 kg ha(-1)). Land-use intensity
   contributed up to 10\% of the variation in the contribution of NaOH-P(i)
   to TP concentrations (ANOVA, Type I). In the Schwabische Alb grassland
   soils, elevated LUI resulted in low NaOH-P(i) concentrations in soil
   which was probably caused by reduced sorption. Our findings highlight
   the importance of LUI as a control of P fractions in soil.}},

Title = {{Identifying drivers of species compositional change in a semi-natural
   upland grassland over a 40-year period}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{346-356}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Question
   Few long-term studies exist with integrated vegetation and soil
   composition data, coupled with detailed environmental driver records.
   Can changes in community composition in an upland grassland be
   identified by revisitation after a 40-year period and allow the main
   environmental drivers of change to be identified?
   Location
   Snowdon, Wales, UK.
   Methods
   Changes in plant community and soil composition were assessed by
   resurveying an upland Agrostis-Festuca grassland in 2008, 40 years after
   the original survey. PCA and ecological indicators were used to
   determine changes in plant community composition. Redundancy analysis
   (RDA) allowed the impact of soil chemical composition on the vegetation
   community to be assessed.
   Results
   A significant shift in community composition was found between years. A
   35\% reduction in species richness and an increase in the grass:forb
   ratio, suggest significant ecosystem degradation. Indicator values
   suggest acidification of the community with an increased acidity
   preference of species recorded in 2008. However, soil pH measurements
   showed that soil pH had increased. RDA suggested that the main shifts in
   species composition were correlated with an increase in pH and a
   reduction in soil exchangeable base cation concentration. Clear
   ecosystem responses to climate, land-use change or nitrogen enrichment
   were not observed.
   Conclusions
   Shifts in vegetation and soil composition are clearly identifiable after
   40 years. The shifts in community composition are consistent with
   ecosystem degradation due to acidification during the period between
   surveys. Ecological indicator values and soil chemical composition
   displayed differing degrees of change. Whilst soils appear to be
   recovering from historic effects of sulphur deposition, vegetation
   community composition changes appear to lag behind those in soil
   chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{For decades, arid desert ecosystems in northwest China, covering
   one-fourth the country's land surface, have experienced a rapid decline
   in plant species diversity, productivity and soil carbon stock owing to
   degradation by overgrazing. In this study, plant community composition,
   diversity and productivity, as well as soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N)
   stocks, were monitored over 26 years from 1981 to 2006 in a severely
   degraded Haloxylon ammodendron-dominated shrubland where livestock
   densities were reduced from 4-5 to 1-2 dry sheep equivalent ha(-1). The
   objective was to assess long-term grazing effects on vegetation and soil
   C and N accumulation dynamics. Results showed that the reduction of
   grazing pressure significantly increased vegetation cover, plant
   diversity and productivity, resulting primarily from an increase in
   livestock-preferred species. Controlled grazing also led to marked
   increases in soil C and N stocks in the top 30 cm of soil. This increase
   was strongly associated with increased plant species richness,
   vegetation cover and biomass production. Averaged over 26 years, soil C
   and N accumulated at rates of 89.9 g C and 8.4 g N m(-2) year(-1),
   respectively, but rates of C and N accumulation varied greatly at
   different time periods. The greatest species regeneration occurred in
   the first 8 years, but the largest C and N accumulation took place
   during years 9-18, with a time-lag in response to changes in vegetation.
   Our results provide insights into the long-term recovery patterns of
   different ecosystem components from the influence of prolonged
   overgrazing disturbance that cannot be inferred from a short-term study.
   The findings are important for assessing the resilience of these
   livestock-disturbed desert ecosystems and developing a more effective
   strategy for the management of this important biome from a long-term
   perspective.}},

Abstract = {{Question: Can wild ungulates efficiently maintain and restore open
   habitats?
   Location: Brandenburg, NE Germany.
   Methods: The effect of wild ungulate grazing and browsing was studied in
   three successional stages: (1) Corynephorus canescens-dominated
   grassland; (2) ruderal tall forb vegetation dominated by Tanacetum
   vulgare; and (3) Pinus sylvestris-pioneer forest. The study was
   conducted over 3 yr. In each successional stage, six paired 4
   m(2)-monitoring plots of permanently grazed versus ungrazed plots were
   arranged in three random blocks. Removal of grazing was introduced de
   novo for the study. In each plot, percentage cover of each plant and
   lichen species and total cover of woody plants was recorded.
   Results: Wild ungulates considerably affected successional pathways and
   species composition in open habitats but this influence became evident
   in alteration of abundances of only a few species. Grazing effects
   differed considerably between successional stages: species richness was
   higher in grazed versus ungrazed ruderal and pioneer forest plots, but
   not in the Corynephorus sites. Herbivory affected woody plant cover only
   in the Pioneer forest sites. Although the study period was too short to
   observe drastic changes in species richness and woody plant cover,
   notable changes in species composition were still detected in all
   successional stages.
   Conclusion: Wild ungulate browsing is a useful tool to inhibit
   encroachment of woody vegetation and to conserve a species-rich, open
   landscape.}},

Abstract = {{Obligate myrmecophilic butterfly species, such as Phengaris (Maculinea)
   teleius and P. nausithous, have narrow habitat requirements. Living as a
   caterpillar in the nests of the ant species Myrmica scabrinodis and M.
   rubra, respectively, they can only survive on sites with both host ants
   and the host plant Great Burnet Sanguisorba officinalis. After having
   been reintroduced into a nature reserve in the Netherlands in 1990, both
   butterfly species expanded their distribution to linear landscape
   elements such as road verges and ditch edges outside this reserve. As
   additional habitat of both butterfly species, vegetation management of
   these landscape elements became important. Our results show that a
   management beneficial for Phengaris butterflies should aim to increase
   the nest density of Myrmica species, at the same time reducing the
   density of nests of the competitor Lasius niger or at least keeping them
   at a low density. Unfavourable grassland management under which L. niger
   thrives, includes not mowing or flail-cutting the grass, or depositing
   dredgings along the side of the ditch. Management favourable for the two
   Myrmica species differs, demanding some flexibility if both species are
   to benefit. M. scabrinodis is best supported with early mowing of the
   road verge vegetation or late mowing in the nature reserve, both of
   which result in an open vegetation and warm microclimate. In contrast,
   the nest sites of M. rubra should be left undisturbed during the summer,
   and mown in late autumn. Mowing of butterfly habitat should be avoided
   between mid-June and mid-September as this would remove the flowerheads
   of the Sanguisorba plants, on which the butterflies lay their eggs.}},

Title = {{Negative Impacts of Human Land Use on Dung Beetle Functional Diversity}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2011}},

Abstract = {{The loss of biodiversity caused by human activity is assumed to alter
   ecosystem functioning. However our understanding of the magnitude of the
   effect of these changes on functional diversity and their impact on the
   dynamics of ecological processes is still limited. We analyzed the
   functional diversity of copro-necrophagous beetles under different
   conditions of land use in three Mexican biosphere reserves. In Montes
   Azules pastures, forest fragments and continuous rainforest were
   analyzed, in Los Tuxtlas rainforest fragments of different sizes were
   analyzed and in Barranca de Metztitlan two types of xerophile scrub with
   different degrees of disturbance from grazing were analyzed. We assigned
   dung beetle species to functional groups based on food relocation,
   beetle size, daily activity period and food preferences, and as measures
   of functional diversity we used estimates based on multivariate methods.
   In Montes Azules functional richness was lower in the pastures than in
   continuous rainforest and rainforest fragments, but fragments and
   continuous forest include functionally redundant species. In small
   rainforest fragments (< 5 ha) in Los Tuxtlas, dung beetle functional
   richness was lower than in large rainforest fragments (> 20 ha).
   Functional evenness and functional dispersion did not vary among habitat
   types or fragment size in these reserves. In contrast, in Metztitlan,
   functional richness and functional dispersion were different among the
   vegetation types, but differences were not related to the degree of
   disturbance by grazing. More redundant species were found in submontane
   than in crassicaule scrub. For the first time, a decrease in the
   functional diversity in communities of copro-necrophagous beetles
   resulting from changes in land use is documented, the potential
   implications for ecosystem functioning are discussed and a series of
   variables that could improve the evaluation of functional diversity for
   this biological group is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{An estimated 32,000 golf courses worldwide (approximately 25,600 km(2)),
   provide ecosystem goods and services and support an industry
   contributing over \$124 billion globally. Golf courses can impact
   positively on local biodiversity however their role in the global carbon
   cycle is not clearly understood. To explore this relationship, the
   balance between plant-soil system sequestration and greenhouse gas
   emissions from turf management on golf courses was modelled. Input data
   were derived from published studies of emissions from agriculture and
   turfgrass management. Two UK case studies of golf course type were used,
   a Links course (coastal, medium intensity management, within coastal
   dune grasses) and a Parkland course (inland, high intensity management,
   within woodland).
   Playing surfaces of both golf courses were marginal net sources of
   greenhouse gas emissions due to maintenance (Links 0.4 +/- 0.1 Mg CO(2)e
   ha(-1) y(-1); Parkland 0.7 +/- 0.2 Mg CO(2)e ha(-1)y(-1)). A significant
   proportion of emissions were from the use of nitrogen fertiliser,
   especially on tees and greens such that 3\% of the golf course area
   contributed 16\% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The area of trees on
   a golf course was important in determining whole-course emission
   balance. On the Parkland course, emissions from maintenance were offset
   by sequestration from trees which comprised 48\% of total area,
   resulting in a net balance of -4.3 +/- 0.9 Mg CO(2e) ha(-1)y(-1). On the
   Links course, the proportion of trees was much lower (2\%) and
   sequestration from links grassland resulted in a net balance of 0.0 +/-
   0.2 Mg CO(2e) ha(-1)y(-1). Recommendations for golf course management
   and design include the reduction of nitrogen fertiliser, improved
   operational efficiency when mowing, the inclusion of appropriate
   tree-planting and the scaling of component areas to maximise golf course
   sequestration capacity. The findings are transferrable to the management
   and design of urban parks and gardens, which range between fairways and
   greens in intensity of management. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Effect of deforestation in palm-epiphytic bryophyte communities in a

Journal = {{BRYOLOGIST}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{155-165}},
Month = {{SPR}},
Abstract = {{Cloud forests are one of the most diverse and yet one of the most
   endangered ecosystems in the tropics. Epiphytic bryophytes are extremely
   diverse and abundant in this ecosystem where the palms are a dominant
   element. Slash and burn agriculture techniques usually do not cut the
   palms and they remain as isolated individuals in the middle of
   artificial grasslands or agricultural fields. Forest clearing creates
   new environments on the isolated trees that have been considered a
   refugee for ``rare{''} canopy species, and the relationship of these
   ``isolated{''} communities with forest communities has been considered
   to be distant. We sampled 99 plots on 11 individuals of the palm
   Dictyocaryum lamarckianum for a total effective sampling area of 15.9
   m(2). The epiphytic communities comprised 72 liverworts and 21 mosses.
   Diplasiolejeunea alata and D. cavifolia are hereby reported for the
   first time from Colombia. We analyzed the changes in bryophyte diversity
   patterns between forests and man-made grasslands and how these patterns
   are related to the distribution of locally rare species. Our results
   showed a decrease in the number of species from the bottom to the top of
   the palm and from the forest to the grassland. Rare species were mostly
   concentrated in the forest independently of height. Common species moved
   on average 4 m downward on the palms in the grassland relative to the
   height on the forest. Ordination of the plots using NMDS provided
   evidence that the change in species composition is gradual between
   forests and grasslands and from the base of the palms to the canopy. We
   propose that the new communities generated by slash and burning
   practices are a combination of drought tolerant species from the forest
   and species that are commonly found in disturbed sites. In conclusion,
   isolated palms are not islands where canopy species can be preserved as
   they harbor only common species.}},

Title = {{Finding solutions for bird restoration and livestock management:
   comparing grazing exclusion levels}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{547-554}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Riparian habitats in the western United States support high avian
   abundance and diversity and are important areas for livestock grazing,
   although grazing contributes to the degradation of riparian vegetation.
   Complete removal of livestock is generally the most beneficial for bird
   communities, but alternative management approaches allowing for seasonal
   livestock grazing may also increase avian habitat quality. Determining
   management approaches that integrate conservation priorities and human
   use has the potential to improve conditions for birds across many grazed
   landscapes. We anticipated that both the full and seasonal exclusion of
   cattle from riparian areas would result in the recovery of avian
   populations. To test this, we experimentally compared the effects of
   total cattle exclusion vs. seasonal usage on bird populations in the
   riparian areas of two creeks in the San Joaquin Valley, California, USA.
   Avian species richness and average abundance were measured over six
   years, from 2001 to 2006. In general, native avian abundance and
   richness increased in both full-and seasonal-exclosure areas, with
   increases compared to the pretreatment year for all years except 2005.
   Habitats that had complete cattle exclusion recovered more
   significantly, with 29\% lower avian abundance in seasonally grazed
   habitats. There was no significant difference in avian richness between
   the two grazing treatments, although richness did increase over time. In
   addition to increases in native species, abundance of nonnative birds
   and brood parasites also increased significantly, with a greater avian
   abundance in the full-exclusion areas. A direct comparison with the
   Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), to further investigate annual avian
   population trends, explained the native species decline in 2005. This
   comparison revealed that observed trends were the effect of experimental
   treatment rather than a reflection of regional trends. Although the
   overall trends indicate that the full exclusion of livestock from
   riparian areas results in more abundant bird populations, seasonal
   exclusion is also a successful method for avian recovery. Land managers
   should consider both options in riparian areas, selecting full cattle
   removal for avian management only and seasonal cattle removal for
   situations where incorporating conservation and land use practices is
   advantageous.}},

Abstract = {{The retention of natural habitat corridors is a useful and practical
   conservation tool that can attenuate the effects of habitat loss and
   fragmentation on wildlife. Linear structures may contribute to the
   conservation of biodiversity by providing additional habitats for small
   fauna living in highly modified environments. We assessed the importance
   of road verges as refuge areas for small mammals, in highly intensified
   grazed pastures, within a Mediterranean landscape and compared the role
   of road verges as refuges with that of riparian galleries, which have
   been described as important shelter locations for small fauna. For this
   purpose, a small mammal trapping study was undertaken on two road verges
   and beside two small streams in southern Portugal. We captured 457
   individuals of five different species, with Mus spretus the most common
   species captured, followed by Crocidura russula. Captures were 4.6-fold
   higher immediately beside both roads and streams than 12 m away in the
   surrounding matrix. Individuals captured in the matrix presented a
   smaller body size and lower body condition, suggesting that this
   suboptimal habitat is occupied mainly by subadults. M. spretus was 46\%
   more abundant by roads than by streams, while C. russula was present in
   similar numbers in both habitats. M. spretus individuals were larger
   near streams but exhibited no difference in body condition between
   habitats. C. russula had a better body condition and slightly higher
   body lengths at roadsides. Our results show that roadside verges in
   intensively grazed Mediterranean landscapes act as important refuges and
   constitute equally vital habitats for small mammals as do riparian
   vegetation strips in landscapes where other suitable habitats are
   scarce.}},

Abstract = {{Thorny shrubs play a crucial role for the diversity and dynamics in wood
   pastures: they protect non-defended plants from large herbivores and
   thus facilitate tree establishment in the landscape through
   associational resistance. How thorny shrubs themselves establish in wood
   pastures - the main bottleneck for a dynamic shifting of grassland -
   shrub - woodland mosaics - is an essential unanswered question. We
   studied post-primary dispersal seed fate - i.e. removal, predation,
   secondary dispersal and survival of seeds after primary dispersal - of
   the thorny shrub blackthorn (Prunus spinosa) in an ancient wood pasture
   in the Netherlands. Blackthorn seeds are primarily dispersed by
   frugivorous birds and may secondarily be dispersed by scatter-hoarding
   rodents.
   We performed two cafeteria-style experiments with blackthorn seeds
   placed on dishes in the dominant vegetation types. In the first we
   monitored seed removal in grassland, swards or blackthorn shrubs and
   determined rodent species abundance by live-trapping. In the second we
   followed tagged blackthorn seeds under shrubs and in swards to determine
   seed removal, predation, survival and secondary dispersal patterns.
   Tagged seeds were retrieved using a metal detector and by visual means.
   We recorded dispersal direction and distance, vegetation type, seed
   handling (burial, consumption) and rodent species responsible via bite
   marks.
   Seed removal and number of live-trapped rodents differed between
   vegetation types, with higher removal and rodent captures under shrubs
   than in swards and grassland. All retrieved seeds were depredated,
   predominantly by the wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus). Disproportionally
   high seed numbers were retrieved in the vegetation type where originally
   placed (shrubs or swards).
   Our study suggests that rodents play an important role for blackthorn in
   wood pastures, predominantly as seed predators rather than secondary
   seed dispersers. Predation is particularly high under blackthorn shrubs,
   suggesting that primary seed dispersal by birds away from shrubs into
   grassland or swards is a prerequisite for blackthorn recruitment in wood
   pastures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Market and policy incentives that encourage agricultural
   intensification, such as incentives for bioenergy, may contribute to
   biodiversity decline when they encourage a large-scale conversion of
   native and semi-natural ecosystems to production fields. In order to
   appreciate the impact of these incentives on biodiversity, it is
   imperative to better understand how native and semi-natural ecosystems
   contribute to plant diversity and composition. We studied the five most
   common types of managed grasslands in Northeastern Kansas, a region
   undergoing agricultural intensification. We analyzed plant community
   data recorded at three spatial scales in 98 managed grassland sites, and
   examined patterns of diversity and composition of plant species and
   functional groups; and spatial turnover of species and functional groups
   measured at different spatial scales. We found reduced soil quality and
   plant diversity as well as a lack of scale-dependent community patterns
   on sites that were historically cultivated. Forage management practices
   (haying or grazing) altered plant diversity and composition in native
   grassland remnants but not in non-native grasslands. We identified
   several opportunities where changes to existing management practices
   could benefit both conservation and bioenergy production objectives.
   Recommendations to conserve biodiversity include increasing the use of
   hay management or other biomass collection on native grassland remnants
   and improving the Conservation Reserve Program by increasing enrollment,
   adding more native species to seed mixes, and incorporating a periodic
   biomass collection. We also found that using measures of spatial
   turnover in community composition added important insights in
   understanding the effects of management decisions on biodiversity.

Abstract = {{A multi-scale and multi-disciplinary method was tested in the Catalan
   pre-Pyrenees in order to understand the relationship between landscape
   change, landscape processes, and ecological and social characteristics
   of landscapes. The three scales, and their corresponding methods, help
   us understand the processes of landscape change: on a general scale, a
   standardisation due to forest spread; on a detailed scale, a
   fragmentation of non-forest habitats; and on a local scale, the
   regeneration and scattering of woody species. Major landscape
   alterations have been observed through remotely sensed data. Closed
   forest area grew 140\% at the expense of non-forest habitats such as
   pastures (-75\%) and cultivated lands (-95\%) during the past 50 years.
   Ecological metrics show a landscape standardisation (SHDI divided by 3)
   and a fragmentation of farmed landscapes. These changes, following a
   spatial pattern based on topography, explain the dynamic of the woody
   species in residual pastures, despite the persistence of cattle grazing
   as observed during field surveys. Yet, the forest, which constitutes the
   matrix of landscape, is not stable because of competition between
   species. The landscape change is related to the decline of the
   population (divided by 4.5 during the past 50 years) and the
   agricultural activities (number of farms divided by 2 or 3 during the
   past 20 years), and the favourable mild climate. The sustainable
   development of this territory should make the objectives of
   conservation, biodiversity and landscape protection and the preservation
   of their Mediterranean features compatible, and support agricultural
   activities that will contribute to this biological diversity and
   cultural identity.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological networks (ENs) are used to mitigate landscape-scale habitat
   loss, and are managed and designed to conserve regional biodiversity. In
   our study region in southern Africa, ENs of isolated grassland remnants
   are specifically set aside and managed for conservation, and are
   complemented by corridor-like power line servitudes which are maintained
   by regular mowing. Using grasshoppers, a sensitive and reliable
   bioindicator taxon, we determine whether ENs effectively conserve
   biodiversity. We used cluster analysis and variation partitioning to
   select the best subset of environmental variables which explained the
   patterns of species composition. We then compared the relative
   importance of environmental variables grouped by the scale of their
   influence: local-scale variables affected by management practices vs.
   landscape-scale variables affected by design of ENs. Management was
   consistently and significantly 2-5 times more influential than design in
   determining grasshopper assemblages within ENs and servitudes.
   Servitudes had a higher proportion of bare ground, lower proportion of
   tall grasses and higher abundance of grasshoppers relative to ENs. Three
   grasshopper species were strongly associated with servitudes and
   exhibited traits consistent with early colonizers. As management actions
   are primarily responsible for vegetation succession, the use of ENs for
   conservation efforts should first focus on appropriate management
   strategies, such as fire regime and grass height management before
   altering the landscape structure (e. g. increasing connectivity or
   enlarging patches). The conservation implications of these results are
   that, if ENs are managed and designed for heterogeneity and to simulate
   multiple successional stages, they may be beneficial for biodiversity
   conservation.}},

Abstract = {{Cattle (Bos taurus) numbers on national forests are allocated based on
   allotment grazing capacity, but spatial patterns of timing and density
   at smaller scales are difficult to assess. However, it is often in
   meadows or riparian areas that grazing may affect hydrology,
   biodiversity, and other important ecosystem characteristics. To explore
   real-time animal presence in montane meadows we distributed 18 digital
   cameras across nine sites in the Sierra National Forest, California. Our
   objectives were to document seasonal and diurnal presence of both cattle
   and mule deer (Odocodetts hemionus), identify the effects of three
   fencing treatments on animal distribution, and test digital photography
   as a tool for documenting cattle presence. We recorded 409 399 images
   during daylight hours for two grazing seasons, and we identified 5 084
   and 24 482 cattle ``marks{''} (instances of animal occurrence) in 2006
   and 2007, respectively. Deer presence was much lower, with 331 marks in
   2006 and 598 in 2007. Morning cattle presence was highest before 0800
   hours both years (13.7\% and 15.4\% of total marks for 2006 and 2007,
   respectively). Marks decreased until 1100 hours and then increased
   around 1400 hours and remained relatively stable until 1900 hours. Marks
   then rose precipitously, with > 20\% of total marks recorded after 1900
   hours both years. Deer presence was less than 10\% per hour until 1800
   hours, when > 20\% of total marks were recorded after this time both
   years. Among treatments, cattle marks were highest outside fences at
   partially fenced meadows, and deer were highest within completely fenced
   meadows. Our experience suggests that cameras are not viable tools for
   meadow monitoring due to variation captured within meadows and the time
   and effort involved in image processing and review.}},

Abstract = {{Commercial livestock production offers one of the main opportunities for
   mainstreaming of biodiversity conservation in the grassland biome of
   South Africa. Grazing management is expected to influence success. With
   the uses of three long-term grazing trials, effects of stocking rate and
   cattle-to-sheep ratio on the plant composition and diversity of Highland
   Sourveld grassland in KwaZulu-Natal were examined. Plant diversity was
   sampled with the use of modified Whittaker plots. Canonical
   correspondence analysis was used to test the effects of treatments on
   compositional variation, and general linear models were used to test
   individual species' responses. In a biennial rotation, burned/grazed
   plots supported lower species richness of forbs and all plants than
   unburned/ungrazed plots, attributed to the impact of grazing during the
   season of occupation. A high stocking rate resulted in a long-term
   decrease of forb richness in one experiment, but an increase in another.
   An increasing proportion of sheep to cattle resulted in a long-term
   decrease of the richness of forbs and of total species richness. The
   three trials identified nongrass species that behaved as increasers or
   decreasers in response to an increase in stocking rate, and a set of
   species that behaved as decreasers in response to an increasing
   proportion of sheep to cattle. Constraints on using long-term trials for
   identifying the effects of livestock management on plant diversity
   include lack of baseline data, limited replication, pre-experimental
   impacts on the study site, and the difficulty of assessing uncommon

Abstract = {{In northern Fennoscandia, the spatial and temporal grazing practices of

   biomass under the browsing height of reindeer (<1.5 m) was also lower on
   summer ranges compared with winter ranges. Especially in drier and
   nutrient poor mountain birch forests, intensive summer grazing reduces
   the quantity of lichens and total plant biomass which affects the
   ecological state and productivity of these forests and also reduces
   especially their winter grazing value for reindeer. Therefore, in
   addition to regulating the maximum sustained numbers of reindeer,
   pasture rotation systems that effectively protect dry and nutrient poor
   vegetation from summer grazing and trampling should be encouraged.}},

Abstract = {{Herbaceous buffers are strips of herbaceous vegetation planted between
   working agricultural land and streams or wetlands. Mowing is a common
   maintenance practice to control woody plants and noxious weeds in
   herbaceous buffers. Buffers enrolled in Maryland's Conservation Reserve
   Enhancement Program (CREP) cannot be mowed during the primary bird
   nesting season between 15 April and 15 August. Most mowing of buffers in
   Maryland occurs in late summer or fall, leaving the vegetation short
   until the following spring. We studied the response of wintering birds
   to fall mowing of buffers. We mowed one section to 10-15 cm in 13
   buffers and kept another section unmowed. Ninety-two percent of birds
   detected in buffers were grassland or scrub-shrub species, and 98\% of
   all birds detected were in unmowed buffers. Total bird abundance,
   species richness, and total avian conservation value were significantly
   greater in unmowed buffers, and Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus
   sandwichenvis), Song Sparrows (Melospiza melodia), and White-throated
   Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) were significantly more abundant in
   unmowed buffers. Wintering bird use of mowed buffers was less than in
   unmowed buffers. Leaving herbaceous buffers unmowed through winter will
   likely provide better habitat for wintering birds. Received 21 December
   2009. Accepted 23 August 2010.}},

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{243-251}},

Abstract = {{We studied the effect of cessation of management on carbohydrate
   reserves of plants in meadows with different environmental
   characteristics and plant composition. We recorded storage carbohydrates
   and seasonal changes for 40 plant species. We asked whether there are
   differences in responses of carbohydrate reserves in forbs versus
   graminoids and in plants storing starch versus plants storing
   osmotically active carbohydrates. We analysed belowground organs before
   the meadows were mown and at the end of the vegetation season in mown
   versus recently abandoned plots. Whereas starch and fructans were widely
   distributed, raffinose family oligosaccharides were the main
   carbohydrate reserves of the Lamiaceae and Plantago lanceolata.
   Properties of carbohydrate reserves differed between forbs and
   graminoids but no difference was found between plants storing starch
   versus osmotically active carbohydrates. Graminoids had lower
   carbohydrate concentrations than forbs. We observed a positive effect of
   mowing on carbohydrate concentrations of graminoids in the dry,
   calcium-rich meadow and higher seasonal fluctuations of these values in
   the acid, wet meadow, suggesting that local factors and/or the species
   pool affect carbohydrate reserves. Despite local conditions, graminoids
   represent a distinct functional group in meadows from the point of view
   of their storage economy. We suggest that as well as growth, storage
   processes should also be considered for understanding the functioning of
   meadow plant communities.}},

Title = {{Active or Passive Forest Restoration? Assessing Restoration Alternatives

Journal = {{RESTORATION ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2011}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{170-177}},

Abstract = {{Active and passive restoration are two important strategies to aid the
   recovery of large areas of deforested and degraded tropical lands.
   Active restoration is where management techniques such as planting seeds
   or seedlings are implemented, and passive restoration is when no action
   is taken except to cease environmental stressors such as agriculture or
   grazing. We compared the habitat quality of active and passive
   restoration sites with similar land-use histories and times since
   abandonment for insectivorous birds by measuring vegetation structure,
   arthropod biomass, and the foraging behavior of three resident bird
   species in southern Costa Rica. Although vegetation measures such as
   amount of understory cover and tree species richness and density
   differed between the two restoration strategies, arthropod biomass and
   foraging behavioral measures were similar. Our results suggest that
   while active and passive restoration strategies may lead to different
   vegetation structures, they may support similar biomass of
   foliage-dwelling arthropods and be similarly used by foraging
   insectivorous birds. Passive restoration is generally less costlier than
   active restoration and, if local and landscape characteristics do not
   impede recovery, may be a viable alternative from the perspective of
   birds using the sites.}},

Abstract = {{The Coussouls de Crau Nature Reserve is a xeric steppe providing a
   habitat for remarkable animals. Over the past centuries, this steppe has
   been partly destroyed and fragmented and has been reduced to 9,500 ha
   out of the 55,000 ha existing before the 16th century. Although this
   ecosystem is protected, 23 ha of natural habitat were nonetheless
   destroyed in 2006 during the construction of an underground pipeline. To
   mitigate potential future damage, an original experiment in restoration
   ecology was adapted and tested: the technique of hay transfer. The
   objective of this experiment was to find ways of accelerating steppe
   vegetation colonization on the soil over the buried pipelines by the
   reintroduction of steppe species. A factorial experiment was set up to
   test the effects of habitat characteristics, grazing, and hay transfer.
   The results obtained for 3 years after the experimentation setup are
   conclusive in favor of using hay transfer for the restoration of
   Mediterranean steppe ecosystem. Hay transfer has significantly increased
   the species richness on restored areas and has allowed the
   reintroduction of some typical steppe species. Among these species, we
   found a wide variety of annual grasses which play a key role in the
   recovery of steppe vegetation and provide food for sheep flocks. Sheep
   herding must be maintained during the ecological restoration of the
   herbaceous steppe community, because grazing significantly increases
   species richness on restored areas without changing species assemblies.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated plant community attributes and selected soil
   characteristics of a Japanese boreal semi-natural grassland among
   day-grazed (24 h), night-grazed and ungrazed sites in Akkeshi, eastern
   Hokkaido. We also evaluated the effects of horse grazing on plant
   species richness and the population of Iris setosa, a hygrophilous
   target species for conservation. Species richness and iris dominance
   were the highest and community height was the lowest at the day-grazed
   site; however, plant coverage and light intensity at ground level did
   not differ significantly among the sites. Soil aeration and water
   permeability of the surface soil were the lowest at the day-grazed site.
   Logistic regression analyses suggested direct and/or indirect positive
   effects of grazing on the occurrence probability of nine species.
   Species richness was negatively correlated with community height, soil
   aeration and water permeability of the surface soil and positively
   correlated with bulk density and soil hardness. Iris dominance was
   negatively correlated with aeration and water permeability and
   positively correlated with surface soil bulk density and volumetric
   water content. Iris dominance was also positively correlated with
   species richness. Canonical correspondence analyses demonstrated
   different species composition among the sites that mainly segregated
   with grazing intensity, soil bulk density, surface soil aeration and
   community height. Our results showed that all-day horse grazing in a
   boreal semi-natural grassland modifies surface soil characteristics and
   increases plant species richness and dominance of I. setosa.}},

Abstract = {{Over 10,000 closed depressions (CDs) are found in the silty plains of
   Northeastern France. These small wetlands support the growth of rare
   plant species. Although their origins, which could be anthropogenic or
   geologic due to salt/gypsum lens dissolution, have been debated for 150
   years, they have not yet been the focus of an integrated study. In 39
   geological borings along a 15-km(2) strip, no salt/gypsum lenses and
   more than 260 CDs were recorded using LiDAR. All of the investigated CDs
   have a bathtub form with a flat bottom. Complete excavations clearly
   showed a cut contact between the sediment and the horizontal marl
   substratum at the bottom, and a cut at the edges of the upper marl
   layers. Radiocarbon dating of sediment bottoms showed that sedimentation
   began between the second Iron Age and the Roman period. The frequencies
   of pollen and Sporormiella-type depict an open landscape with grassland,
   pasture and cropland. These convergent findings challenge the hypothesis
   that CDs formed naturally and suggest that they area instead
   anthropogenic. Because no soil deposits were found around the CDs,
   digging may have been intended to marl the surrounding acidic silty
   soils. The high density and small size of CDs will allow the detailed
   reconstruction of landscape and biodiversity modifications in the region
   for the two last millennia. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},
